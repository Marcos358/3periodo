 id=314768 title mary gaudron nonfiltered 2 processed 2 dbindex 1500001 mary genevieve gaudron born 5 january 1943 australian lawyer and judge was the first female justice of the high court of australia youth gaudron was born in moree in northern rural new south wales in 1943 the daughter of working class parents edward and grace gaudron would later speak about the intense racism towards indigenous australians which was a part of everyday life in moree and how it influenced her strong opposition to all forms of discrimination indeed moree was the site of a violent conflict during the freedom ride of 1965 in 1951 h v evatt passed through moree to campaign for the no case in the 1951 referendum at which the menzies liberal government was attempting to alter the constitution of australia in order to ban the australian communist party evatt was addressing a small crowd from the back of a blue holden ute discussing the upcoming referendum and the constitution and gaudron not knowing what evatt was referring to asked please sir what s a constitution to which evatt explained that it was the laws by which parliaments were governed gaudron asked whether it was similar to the ten commandments and evatt replied that you could call it the ten commandments of government gaudron then asked for a copy and evatt subsequently sent her one in the mail gaudron expecting two stone tablets was disappointed to receive only a small pamphlet however when the school bullies declared the pamphlet useless gaudron retorted that it was of great use to lawyers and that some day she would be one education gaudron was educated at st ursula s college in armidale in 1960 she was awarded a federal government scholarship to study for a bachelor of arts degree at the university of sydney which she graduated with in 1962 in 1961 she had also commenced a part time bachelor of laws degree graduating in 1965 with first class honours and the university s medal for law gaudron was the second female recipient after elizabeth evatt and the first female part time student to be awarded the medal gaudron s lecturers there had included her future high court colleague anthony mason while studying gaudron attempted to obtain articles of clerkship then five years in duration but was not successful as she later said many distinguished lawyers took a lot of trouble and effort to explain to me that it was not their policy to take on women as articled clerks instead she took a job with the government of australia although in accordance with the public service regulations she was sacked when she married when gaudron graduated with her law degree she was pregnant with her first daughter danielle in 1988 gaudron was awarded an honorary doctorate in law from macquarie university and another from the university of sydney in 1999 career barrister gaudron was admitted to the new south wales bar in october 1968 after having completed her articles of clerkship and commenced practice as a barrister she attempted to buy a room for herself in one of the barristers chambers in sydney but was regularly knocked back because she was a woman when future high court colleague michael mchugh attempted to sell his room the other members of his chambers would not let gaudron buy it although there were no other buyers she eventually shared a room with janet coombs another pioneering female barrister gaudron regularly argued before the supreme court of new south wales and the high court in the early 1970s particularly in the area of industrial law in 1972 she became the first woman to be appointed to the council of the new south wales bar one of gaudron s most significant cases as a barrister was in 1972 when she successfully argued the equal pay case for the whitlam labor government before the conciliation and arbitration commission early in 1972 gaudron had entered a bar with a male barrister friend when the waitress informed the friend that the bar did not serve women gaudron patiently explained to the barmaid that my friend didn t want a woman because he d brought his own eventually creating something of a scene which attracted the attention of labor politician clyde cameron who said that he didn t realise that such sexual discrimination still existed gaudron then said that the discrimination being practised in that particular hotel was nothing compared to the discrimination over which he would undoubtedly preside when he became minister for industrial relations after the next election however the whitlam government was elected on 2 december and cameron duly became minister for industrial relations whitlam called gaudron on 3 december to hire her to argue the case the case begun by the australian council of trade unions and supported by the whitlam government when it came to power late in the year extended the reach of the original but limited equal pay decision of 1969 prior decisions had guaranteed equal pay only for certain specific occupations and later certain limited industries industries traditionally considered women s work such as the textile industry whereas this case extended the principle of equal pay to all workers gaudron s argument was based on the principles of the 1951 equal remuneration convention of the international labour organization the organisation which she would later come to work for although gaudron later came to regard her own argument that australia had not ratified the convention because the commission would not grant equal pay thus preventing australia from fulfilling its obligations under the convention as somewhat disingenuous and recalled it with a measure of embarrassment conciliation and arbitration commission in april 1974 gaudron herself was appointed to the conciliation and arbitration commission as deputy president becoming the youngest ever federal judge it was rumoured that cameron had advocated in cabinet for her appointment first by emphasising her outstanding academic record but then by noting her humble working class background to which whitlam supposedly said next you ll be telling us she was born in a bloody manger by the time of her appointment gaudron had given birth to her second daughter julienne gaudron s most notable case on the arbitration commission was an important test case for maternity leave in 1979 which laid down award standards allowing for a year s unpaid leave for all full time and permanent part time workers in 1979 gaudron was the inaugural chair of the new south wales legal services commission gaudron held the position of deputy president until her resignation in may 1980 lecturer qc and solicitor general gaudron then lectured at the university of new south wales law school but only for a brief time as in february 1981 she was appointed the solicitor general of new south wales the first female solicitor general in any australian jurisdiction also that year she was made a queen s counsel qc the first female qc in new south wales gaudron was soon married a second time and later gave birth to a son patrick in her capacity as solicitor general gaudron argued for new south wales in such landmark high court cases as the tasmanian dams case and the actors equity case from 1981 to 1986 gaudron served on the council of macquarie university and from 1984 to 1986 chaired an advisory council at the university of wollongong high court justice after the death of justice lionel murphy in october 1986 and the retirement of chief justice harry gibbs in february 1987 two vacancies were created on the high court and on 6 february 1987 john toohey and gaudron were appointed to the court at just 44 years of age gaudron was the fourth youngest justice after evatt mctiernan and dixon as a high court justice gaudron contributed to every area of australian law although most notably to australian criminal law in judgments that combine technical mastery with a general tendency to insist on strict compliance by trial judges with their obligations in directing juries gaudron was an important part of the progressive mason and brennan courts which decided such influential cases as cole v whitfield dietrich v the queen and the mabo case gaudron has consistently been opposed to all forms of discrimination with notable judgments in this vein including the decision in street v queensland bar association on section 117 of the australian constitution and her joint judgment with justice mchugh in castlemaine tooheys v south australia she was generally regarded as not particularly emotive in her writing style although the judgment for which she is perhaps best remembered popularly was in the mabo case where in joint judgment with justice deane she said that australia s past treatment of indigenous australians was the darkest aspect of the history of this nation retirement on 21 june 2002 gaudron announced her retirement from the high court effective from 10 february 2003 she left the court at the age of just 60 the mandatory retirement age is 70 gaudron s early retirement was lamented by all areas of the legal profession justice michael kirby who was a close friend of gaudron has stated many times that her absence left the court with a different character turned it into a more blokey place in march 2003 gaudron joined the international labour organization ilo in geneva switzerland in 2004 she was a member of an inquiry into trade union rights in belarus she was also appointed as a judge of the ilo s administrative tribunal in 2005 the international labour conference renewed her term until 30 june 2008 criticism gaudron has been occasionally criticised throughout her career at the time of her appointment to the high court in 1987 the new south wales legal magazine justinian published anonymous remarks saying that a melancholy catalogue of sins of omission and commission as well as the better claims of others ought to have weighed against her appointment and that she held an emotional disposition inappropriate in a holder of judicial office when she announced her retirement an anonymous academic said that gaudron had failed to achieve the expectations set by her supporters and that among the other high court justices gaudron was erratic and certainly not among the court s greats another anonymous academic said that gaudron s labor connections had delivered unearned promotion approbation yet despite this consistently anonymous criticism gaudron has also received much praise former president of the new south wales bar ruth mccoll described gaudron s contribution to australian law as an extraordinarily humanising effect the strong views she expresses in cases involving discrimination and like issues are very influential and important in the development of the law in those areas the anti discrimination commissioner of tasmania jocelynne scutt said that her contribution has been outstanding both as a jurist and as an advocate and it has been profoundly significant in terms of her being a woman too former chief justice anthony mason remarked that gaudron s contribution just can t be described as symbolic but rather she had made a very significant and genuine contribution to australian law in her own assessment gaudron described herself in 2005 as privileged to be a bit player in the maintenance of the rule of law in australia

 id=2351529 title 2 inch quadruplex videotape nonfiltered 13 processed 13 dbindex 1500012 2 inch quadruplex also called 2 quad or just quad for short was the first practical and commercially successful videotape format it was developed and released for the broadcast television industry in 1956 by ampex an american company based in redwood city california this format revolutionized television broadcast operations and production since the only medium available to the tv industry before then was motion picture film used for kinescopes which was much more costly to utilize had lower image quality than videotape and took time to develop as well since most west coast network delays done by the tv networks at the time were done with film kinescopes that needed time for developing the networks wanted a more practical cost effective and quicker way to time shift programming for later airing in the west coast as well as a general production medium that was not as costly or time consuming to edit and develop as film these reasons were part of the motivation for designing a video recording technology that used magnetic tape in this case the 2 inch quad the format gets its official name of quadruplex from the fact that it uses 4 heads mounted on a headwheel spinning tranversely width wise across the tape at a rate of 14 400 rpm for ntsc standard quad decks and 15 000 rpm for those using the european pal video standard this method was called quadrature scanning as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats the tape ran at a speed of either 7 5 or 15 inches per second 190 or 380 mm s 15 625 inches per second 400 mm s pal and the audio control and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion on the edges of the tape the cue track was used either as a second audio track or for recording cue tones or time code for editing a typical 4800 foot 1500 m reel of 2 inch quad tape holds approximately 1 hour of recorded material at 15 inches per second 380 mm s each transversely recorded track of video on a 2 inch quad videotape holds one sixteenth of a field of video in other words the format used segmented recording this meant that 2 inch quad was not capable of trick play functions such as still shuttle and reverse variable speed playback but the format had quite sufficient image quality for broadcast it produced about 400 lines of video resolution and remained the de facto format and industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in 1956 to the mid 1980s when newer smaller and lower maintenance videotape formats supplanted the role of 2 inch quad there were 3 different variations of 2 inch quad low band which was the first variety of quad introduced by ampex in 1956 high band which used a wider bandwidth for recording video to the tape resulting in higher resolution video from the vtr and super high band which used a pilot tone for better timebase stability and higher coercivity tape most quad machines made later in the 60s and 70s by ampex could playback both low and high band 2 inch quad tape the beginning of quad at the beginning of the 1950 s several companies along with ampex such as bing crosby enterprises bce and rca were all competing to release a videotape format rca and bce did release working prototypes of their recorders but their downfall was that they all used a longitudinal stationary head method of recording much like audio tape recorders this meant that the tape had to be recorded at a ludicrously high speed around 120 in s in order to record a sufficient amount of bandwidth to reproduce an adequate video image at least 2 3 mhz for a watchable image in turn requiring large amounts of tape on large reels used by these early machines from rca and bce in britain at that time the bbc developed a similar stationary head vtr system that saw some on air use called vera vision electronic recording apparatus plus time shifting of television programming for the west coast by the networks at the time in order to broadcast their programming at the same local time in the east and west coasts using film kinescopes was quite a rushed and perilous ordeal this was due to there being only 3 hours for the west coast branches of the tv networks to receive video for the programming from the east coast live via leased microwave relay or coaxial cable circuits provided from the phone company at t at the time and then to record such to film kinescopes and lastly to develop the film to be aired 3 hours later on the west coast this usually meant the kinescope film was aired almost immediately after it came straight out of the developing equipment still warm from the film dryer used to dry the film prints coming out of the developing chemicals these were referred to by the networks as hot kines according to the history of tape recording website the networks used more raw film stock for kinescope delays for the west coast than all of the hollywood film studios combined they were desperate to obtain a quicker less expensive and more practical solution ampex seeing the impracticality of the prototype bce and rca vtrs started to develop a more practical videotape format with tape economy in mind as well as providing a solution to the networks west coast delay woes starting in 1952 ampex built the mark i prototype vtr using 2 inch wide tape ampex decided that instead of having the tape move fast across the head to record enough bandwidth for video that the head move fast across the tape instead this resulted in the mark i using arcuate scanning which consisted of a spinning disk where its face where the heads were mounted was in contact with the tape as opposed to the edge of the headwheel with transverse quadrature scanning this resulted in an arc shaped track being recorded across the width of the tape arcuate scanning resulted in a head to tape speed of about 2500 in s but problems with timebase stability of the reproduced video signal from the tape led ampex to abandon arcuate scanning in favor of the more reliable transverse scanning system ampex soldiered on throughout the mid 50s with the mark ii and mark iii prototype recorders which now used transverse scanning the mark ii used frequency modulation for recording video to tape resulting in a much improved but still noisy video image the mark i had used amplitude modulation and the mark iii had improved signal processing and servo electronics resulting in perfect video being reproduced from the machine the mark iii worked perfectly but its appearance was quite that of a prototype and not a finished saleable product it was in a makeshift wooden case with several parts of its chassis externally mounted in partially filled racks so ampex went on to integrate all of this into a sleek metal console and fully populated rack mount cases and this became the mark iv the mark iv was the machine for the first public demonstration of the 2 inch quad format at the nartb now the nab convention in chicago on april 14 1956 the earlier mark iii was given some cosmetic improvements and was also demonstrated at ampex headquarters in redwood city the same day both demonstrations were a success and as a result ampex was swamped with orders for the new 2 inch quad vtr ampex later released the first manufactured models of quad vtr based on the mark iv which were also prototypes the vrx 1000 of which 16 were made machines made afterward were the final production models and were designated as the vr 1000 shortly after ampex s introduction of the 2 inch quad format rca in 1957 introduced a quad compatible vtr the trt 1a rca referred to it as a television tape recorder since the word videotape was a trademark of ampex at the time later on ampex would release later models of their quad decks such as the second generation vr 2000 in 1967 and the avr series of vtrs avr 1 avr 2 and avr 3 in the 1970s the avr 2 was the most compact of quad vtrs and could run off on regular 120 volt single phase household type ac power quad vtrs before then required 208 or 220 volt 3 phase ac power rca would also release later models of quad vtrs as well such as the tr 22 and tr 600 cbs was the first television network to use 2 inch quad videotape using it for a west coast delay of douglas edwards and the news on november 30 1956 cbs would also delay for the west coast the first entertainment tv program on videotape the edsel show on october 13 1957 the developing engineers at ampex that worked on 2 inch quadruplex videotape from the mark i to the vr 1000 were charles ginsburg alex maxey fred pfost shelby henderson charlie anderson and ray dolby who later went on to found dolby laboratories 2 inch quad today nowadays 2 inch quad is no longer used as a mainstream format in tv broadcasting and video production having been supplanted by more modern easier to use more practical and lower maintenance formats like 1 type c 1976 u matic betacam dvcam dvcpro and hdcam when it was in use 2 inch quad vtrs needed ongoing maintenance usually 3 phase power to operate as mentioned earlier plus an air compressor to provide air pressure for the air bearing that the spinning transverse headwheel rode on due to its high rotational speed some quad vtrs such as the portable ampex vr 3000 used ball bearings instead due to the lack of availability of compressed air but these wore out quickly they also required constant calibration of the discrete electronics used by the older quad vtrs in order to maintain a high quality picture suitable for broadcast the operator was a much more skilled technician than today s pop in a cassette operators these machines required quite a bit of set up in order to make a quality recording and a broadcast quality image for playback 2 inch quad vtrs today are not used for broadcast or production service the few that remain in service are now used by video archives and transfer services for the transfer and or restoration of 2 inch quad videotape material to a newer format see also videotape contrast with helical scan recording external links a

history it features over 100 driver profiles and over 15 teams who set standards for mediocrity in f1 with their results all one has to do to escape eligibility from being a f1 reject is to either score a 1st through 4th place finish or one 5th and another top 6 result or three or more 6th places although there is an un written rule in the criteria which was addressed during the off season podcast january 21 2007 where a listener of f1 rejects asked why drivers who had lost their lives while driving a formula one car and were eligible for reject status roger williamson and tony brise for example were not listed on the rejects drivers page this would explain why an article on roland ratzenberger is in the reject centrale section instead the site was created in 1999 by australians jamie mcgregor the site s webmaster and enoch law the senior grand prix analyst who is the author of most of the material on the site focus on current f1 the site features a page called reject centrale which is home to the reviews of the last grand prix held and every grand prix held since the beginning of the 2000 season there are also feature articles which either the site author or webmaster has created later on the page there are submitted articles from readers of the website at the beginning and end of the year f1 rejects does both an f1 season preview and review the season preview is a team by team synopsis of their predictions for the season while the season review offers thoughts and driver by driver summaries with the bottom three ranked drivers completing that year

podcasts since august 4 2005 f1 rejects have been broadcasting podcasts where mcgregor and law sit down and had a chat about the latest grand prix topics of discussion have included the latest news in f1 great moments in f1 punditry where a clip of some reject worthy moment is played the most popular being quotes from james hunt and a bit of history about the grand prix praise and criticisms f1 rejects is well known within the world of f1 fans on the internet the site has been praised for its humorous and critical profiling of drivers the site has been praised for looking at their drivers in a non malicious manner many drivers and teams with short careers in the sport have lengthy profiles on the site profiles are very informative and contain facts about the driver or teams career prior to f1 and after if known the site has been praised for its high level of knowledge and research used to find details on relatively obscure drivers at the a1 grand prix meeting at eastern creek australia in november 2005 the site managed to arrange an interview with rejects andrea montermini and alex yoong the site has been accused of schadenfreude by some critics however supporters of the site dispute this stating that f1 rejects gives praise to drivers who large fanbases have viewed as poor an example of this is alex yoong who whilst being slower than teammates fernando alonso and mark webber and being in f1 purely down to wealthy backing has been viewed with lots of sympathy from f1 rejects due to his circumstances with minardi during this period similarly f1 rejects have been accused of several driver biases notably against juan pablo montoya giancarlo fisichella and ralf schumacher however supporters state that these so called biases are merely reflecting their disappointment on the driver underperforming rather than being outright critical of them in their podcast for the 2006 brazilian grand prix both jamie and enoch decided to respond to these criticisms by highlighting some of ralf schumacher s best races such as the 2001 san marino grand prix similarly the site authors nominated themselves for their reject of the race award after giancarlo fisichella s impressive drive to third in the 2001 belgian grand prix reflecting the good natured humour of the website publicocrapometer f1 rejects have also produced the publicocrapometer it is an imaginary machine that alerts people to publicocrap their term for media statements from drivers and teams which are overblown and publicity seeking however it completely failed when it highlighted

a force of approximately 40 000 men the clever withdrawal of the german king s army saved its existence frundsberg considered the withdrawal on valenciennes as the greatest luck and most appropriate measure during war he then proceeded to italy and brought the greater part of lombardy under the influence of charles v through his victory at the battle of bicocca in april 1522 after the french campaign in 1522 ended and frundsberg resigned from the leadership of the landesknechts he returned to lead the march on upper italy within a short period 6000 men followed the beat of his campaign

for the capture of the french king only one year later when the war in italy was renewed in 1526 frundsberg received a call for help from the kaiser s army in lombardei to help decide the war albeit an insufficient amount he obtained 36 000 german taler to organize the new army during his occupation of mindelheim frundsberg borrowed money and sold off his silver table settings and his wife s jewelry in order to acquire the remaining funds to raise the army in less than three weeks frundsberg organized over 12 000 men and crossed the alps during the middle of november he joined the constable de bourbon near piacenza and marched towards rome however before he reached the eternal city near modena on march 13 1527 order and discipline broke in 1527 when no decisive battle developed after months of campaigning in italy payment for the mercenaries remained overdue and in the end even frundsberg was unable to rally the landsknechts and restore order the matter shook the old commander to such an extent that he suffered a stroke unable to regain his physical strength frundsberg was moved to germany after a long struggle in italian hospitals tormented by great anxiety over the situation with his mercenaries or beloved sons the loss of his personal estate and death of one of his sons frundsberg died on 20 august 1528 in his castle in mindelheim he was a capable and

 id=10898 title fugue state nonfiltered 44 processed 43 dbindex 1500043 for the new york city based publisher see fugue state press in the field of psychology a fugue state is usually defined by the term dissociative fugue it is etiologically related to dissociative amnesia which in popular culture is usually simply called amnesia the state where someone completely forgets who they are a fugue state is therefore similar in nature to the concept of dissociative identity disorder did formerly called multiple personality disorder although did is widely understood to have its conception in a long term life event such as a traumatic childhood where sufficient time is given for alternate personality representations to form and take hold sudden neurological damage would thus seem to fit more closely the onset of a fugue state as the person experiencing a fugue state may have recently suffered an amnesic onset perhaps a head trauma or the reappearance of an event or person representing an earlier life trauma the emergence of a new personality seems to be for some a logical apprehension of the situation therefore the terminology fugue state may carry a slight linguistic distinction from dissociative fugue the former implying a greater degree of motion for the purposes of this article then a fugue state would occur while one is acting out a dissociative fugue the dsm iv defines dissociative fugue as sudden unexpected travel away from home or one s customary place of work with inability to recall one s past confusion about personal identity or the assumption of a new identity or significant distress or impairment the merck manual defines dissociative fugue as one or more episodes of amnesia in which the inability to recall some or all of one s past and either the loss of one s identity or the formation of a new identity occur with sudden unexpected purposeful travel away from home in support of this definition the merck manual further defines dissociative amnesia as an inability to recall important personal information usually of a traumatic or stressful nature that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness prevalence and onset it has been estimated that approximately 0 2 percent of the population experiences dissociative fugue although prevalence increases significantly following a stressful life event such as wartime experience or some other disaster other life stressors may trigger a fugue state such as financial difficulties personal problems or legal issues unlike a dissociative identity disorder a fugue is usually considered to be a malingering disorder resolving to remove the experiencer from responsibility for their actions or from situations imposed upon them by others similar to dissociative amnesia the fugue state usually affects personal memories from the past rather than encyclopedic or abstract knowledge a fugue state therefore does not imply any overt seeming or crazy behaviour treatment and prognosis most fugues last for hours or days and disappear on their own dissociative fugue is treated much the same as dissociative amnesia and treatment may include the use of hypnosis or drug facilitated interviews most people who suffer dissociative fugues regain most or all of their prior memories however efforts to restore memories of the fugue period usually are unsuccessful the goal of treatment is to help the person come to terms with the stress or trauma that triggered the fugue treatment also aims to develop new coping methods to prevent further fugue episodes the best treatment approach depends on the individual and the severity of his or her symptoms but most likely will include some combination of the following treatment methods psychotherapy psychotherapy a type of counseling is the main treatment for dissociative disorders this treatment uses techniques designed to encourage communication of conflicts and increase insight into problems cognitive therapy this type of therapy focuses on changing dysfunctional thinking patterns and resulting feelings and behaviors medication there is no medication to treat the dissociative disorders themselves however a person with a dissociative disorder who also suffers from depression or anxiety might benefit from treatment with a medication such as an antidepressant or anti anxiety medicine family therapy this helps to teach the family about the disorder and its causes as well as to help family members recognize symptoms of a recurrence creative therapies art therapy music therapy these therapies allow the patient to explore and express his or her thoughts and feelings in a safe and creative way clinical hypnosis this is a treatment method that uses intense relaxation concentration and focused attention to achieve an altered state of consciousness awareness allowing people to explore thoughts feelings and memories they might have hidden from their conscious minds the use of hypnosis for treating dissociative disorders is controversial due to the risk of creating false memories cases joe bieger on 5 october 2006 joe bieger wandered the streets of dallas texas for 25 days doug bruce the

 id=49216 title full stop nonfiltered 56 processed 55 dbindex 1500056 a full stop or period sometimes stop full point or dot is the punctuation mark commonly placed at the end of several different types of sentences in english and several other languages a full stop consists of a small dot placed at the end of a line of text such as at the end of this sentence the term full stop is rarely used by speakers in the united states and canada if it is used in canada it may be generally differentiated from period in contexts where both might be used a full stop is specifically a delimiting piece of punctuation that represents the end of a sentence when a distinction is made a period is then any appropriately sized and placed dot in english language text including use in abbreviations such as u k and at the ends of sentences but excluding certain special uses of dots at the bottom of a line of text such as ellipses the term stop was used in telegrams in place of the period in telegrams the end of a sentence would be marked by stop as using full stop was costly the end of the entire telegram would be noted by full stop the word period although recognised as an americanism is also used vernacularly throughout the english speaking world to terminate a phrase or thought with finality and emphasis as in this is your last chance period the term full stop is also used in this sense in many parts of the world abbreviations the period is also used after abbreviations such as mrs ms if the abbreviation is ending a declaratory sentence an additional full stop is not needed e g my name is phil simpson jr but in the case of an interrogative or exclamatory sentence a question or exclamation mark is needed in british english dr and mr do not need a period as they include both the first and last letter of the abbreviated word but in american english these are written dr and mr in this use the period is also occasionally known as the suspension mark mathematical usage the same glyph has two separate uses with regard to numbers the one applied being determined by the country it is used in as a decimal separator and in presenting large numbers in a more readable form in most english speaking countries the full stop has the former usage while a comma or a space is used for the latter 1 000 000 one million 1 000 000 one thousand in much of europe however a comma is used as a decimal separator while a full stop or a space is used for the presentation of large numbers in countries that use the comma as a decimal separator the full stop is sometimes found as a multiplication sign for example 5 2 2 10 4 this usage is impossible in countries that use the period as a decimal separator hence the use of the interpunct 5 2 2 10 4 differences in british english and american english in british english when a quotation mark appears at the end of a sentence the full stop is usually placed after it the matter is partly determined by the length of the enclosed material the longer it is more acceptable it is that the full stop should come first any full sentence enclosed within quotation marks will have its full stop before the final quotation mark in american english the full stop normally comes before the quotation mark this applies to commas and some other punctuation also examples of typical usage you say tomayto i say tomahto i say tomayto you say tomahto an exception to the american rule occurs when the placing of the full stop inside the quote would lead to ambiguity for example in describing commands to be typed into a computer at the prompt type ls lad in the case above giving the instruction at the prompt type ls lad would result in an error since the full stop has special significance in instructions typed into a computer spacing after full stop in typewritten texts and other documents printed in fixed width fonts there is a convention among lay writers that two spaces are placed after the full stop along with the other sentence enders question mark and exclamation mark as opposed to the single space used after other punctuation symbols this is sometimes termed french spacing in modern english language typographical usage debate has arisen concerning the proper number of trailing spaces after a full stop or exclamation mark or question mark to separate sentences within a paragraph whereas two spaces are still regarded by many outside the publishing industry to be the better usage for monospace typefaces the awkwardness that most word processing applications have in representing correctly the 1 5 spaces that had previously become standard for typographically proportional non monospace fonts has led to some confusion about how to render the space between sentences using only word processing tools many descriptivists i e people who describe how language is used in practice support the notion that a single space after a full stop should be considered standard because it has been the norm in mainstream publishing for many decades this also includes the mla apa and the cms many prescriptivists i e people who make recommendations for rules of language use meanwhile adhere to the earlier use of two spaces on typewriters to make the separation of sentences more salient than separation of elements within sentences some however accept that in modern word processing the single space is better because two spaces may stretch inordinately when full justification is applied additionally many computer typefaces are designed proportionately to alleviate the need for the double space the opposition would of course reply that this does nothing to satisfy the aforementioned saliency issue most modern typesetters designers and desktop publishers use only one space after a period as do most mainstream publishers of books and journals with the advent of standardized html for rendering webpages the broader distinction between full stop spacing and internal spacing in a sentence has become largely moot on the world wide web standardized html treats additional whitespace after the first space as immaterial siding unquestioningly with the one spacers and ignores it when rendering the page a common workaround for this is the use of nbsp non breaking space to represent extra spaces and is done automatically by some wysiwyg editors a strong argument for having two spaces after a full stop arises from accessibility or universal design it is often reported that people with dyslexia prefer double spacing after a full stop see justification typesetting for further discussion asian full stop in some asian languages notably chinese and japanese a small circle is used instead of a solid dot u 3002 ideographic full stop unlike the western full stop this is often used to separate consecutive sentences rather than to finish every sentence it is frequently left out where a sentence stands alone or where text is terminated by a quotation mark instead in these languages the partition sign ji ngéhào is often used to separate the transliteration of a foreign given name from the family name for example william shakespeare is represented in chinese as weilian shashibiya and in japanese as uiriamu sheikusupia with a partition sign inserted between the characters for william and those of shakespeare the chinese partition sign is also used to separate book title and chapter title when they are mentioned consecutively with book title first then chapter computing use in computing the period is often used as a delimiter commonly called a dot for example in dns lookups and file names for example www example com document doc in computer programming the full stop corresponds to unicode and ascii character 46 or 0x2e notes see also dot decimal separator

as emperor jingmu with the temple name gongzong by his son emperor wencheng was a crown prince of the chinese xianbei dynasty northern wei he was the oldest son of emperor taiwu and was created crown prince in 432 at the age of four and as he grew older emperor taiwu transferred more and more authority to him however in 451 he incurred the wrath of his father due to false accusations of the eunuch zong ai and many of his associates were put to death he himself grew ill in fear and died that year early life tuoba huang was born in 428 as emperor taiwu s oldest son his mother s name was render as consort he but since both the helan and helai clans later changed their names to he during the reign of tuoba huang s great grandson emperor xiaowen it is unclear whether her name was helan or helai she died the year that she gave birth to him suggesting that she might have died in childbirth but there is no conclusive evidence that it happened in 432 emperor taiwu created tuoba huang crown prince at the same time that he created one of his consorts consort helian empress he became a highly ranked official in his father s administration that same year although at age four the position was likely nominal in 433 emperor taiwu tried to negotiate a marriage between crown prince huang and one of the daughters of emperor wen of liu song but emperor wen while not immediately rejecting the proposal did not agree either in 439 when emperor taiwu was on a campaign to conquer northern liang he had crown prince huang assume imperial authority at the capital pingcheng in modern datong shanxi assisted by the high ranking official qiumuling shou to guard against a rouran attack however qiumuling not believing that rouran would actually attack took little actual precautions and when rouran s chilian khan yujiulü wuti attacked pingcheng was caught nearly defenseless qiumuling wanted to escort crown prince huang to the hills south of pingcheng and take up defense position there but at the opposition of emperor taiwu s wet nurse empress dowager dou crown prince huang remained in pingcheng and when northern wei forces subsequently defeated rouran forces yujiulü wuti was forced to withdraw by this point although he was only 11 crown prince huang was apparently already participating in major military and policy decisions as he had opposed his father s northern liang campaign but was overruled by his father who trusted cui hao s advice that northern liang was easily defeatable by 442 crown prince huang appeared to be already a devout buddhist and when his father at the suggestion of cui and the taoist monk kou qianzhi built the very high and difficult to construct jinglun palace he tried to oppose on account of cost but emperor taiwu did not agree in 443 crown prince huang accompanied his father on a campaign against rouran and when theysuddenly encountered yujiulü wuti crown prince huang advised an immediate attack but emperor taiwu hesitated allowing yujiulü wuti to escape from that point on emperor taiwu began to listen to crown prince huang s advice in earnest and in winter 443 he authorized crown prince huang to carry out all imperial duties except the most important ones under assistance from qiumuling cui zhang li and tuxi bi crown prince huang soon instituted a policy to encourage farming by mandatorily requiring those who had extra cattle to loan them to those without to be animals of burden with the lease being paid for by those without cattle by tilling the grounds of the cattle owners increasing the efficiency of the farmlands greatly after emperor taiwu s partial transfer of authority in 446 while emperor taiwu was attacking the xiongnu rebel gai wu he found a large number of weapons in buddhist temples in chang an believing that the monks were aligned with gai he slaughtered the monks in chang an cui hao used this opportunity to encourage emperor taiwu to slaughter all monks throughout the empire and destroy the temples statues and sutras and notwithstanding kou qianzhi s opposition emperor taiwu proceeded to slaughter the monks in chang an destroy the statues and burn the sutras he then issued an empire wide prohibition of buddhism crown prince huang however used delaying tactics in promulgating the edict allowing buddhists to flee or hide but it was said that not a single buddhist temple remained standing in northern wei this was the first of the three disasters of wu by 450 crown prince huang appeared to be in direct conflict with cui over administration of the state when cui recommended a number of men to be commandery governors crown prince huang objected strenously and yet the men were commissioned over his objection at cui s insistence it appeared that crown prince huang had a hand when later in 450 cui was put to death with his entire clan on account of having defamed imperial ancestors as crown prince huang argued hard to spare one of cui s staff members gao yun and during that process gao gave some statements regarding cui that could be viewed either as exculpatory or inculpatory in fall of 450 when liu song s emperor wen sent his general wang xuanmo to attack huatai in modern anyang henan emperor taiwu personally led an army to relieve huatai and subsequently after defeating wang advanced deeply into liu song territory all the way to the yangtze river during emperor taiwu s campaign against liu song pursuant to his instructions crown prince huang was on the northern border defending against a potential rouran attack death and aftermaths crown prince huang was described to be high observant but trusting of his associates and also spending much effort on managing orchards and farms to earn money from them gao yun tried to advise him against engaging in commercial ventures and in overly delegating authorities but he did not listen rather in 451 he became embroiled in a conflict with the eunuch zong ai whose corruption he had found out and whom he disliked immensely zong apprehensive that crown prince huang s trusted associates chouni daosheng and ren pingcheng would accuse him of crimes acted preemptorily and accused chouni and ren of crimes in anger emperor taiwu executed chouni and ren and many other associates of crown prince huang were entangled in the case and executed as well in fear crown prince huang became ill and died emperor taiwu soon became aware that crown prince huang was not involved in any crimes and he regretted his actions greatly around the new year 451 he created crown prince huang s oldest son tuoba jun the prince of gaoyang but soon removed that title on the account that the crown prince s oldest son should not be a mere imperial prince a strong sign that he was intending to create tuoba jun crown prince ventually zong in fear that emperor taiwu would punish him assassinated emperor taiwu in spring 452 and then seized power killing a number of officials and crown prince huang s younger brother

judicious selection from the best features of those fine arts a man has more fun wishing for the things he hasn t got than enjoying the things he has got i wonder why you can always read a doctor s bill and you never can read his prescription one of the strangest things about life is that the poor who need money the most are the very ones that never have it when the american people get through with the english language it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy if you go to the zoo always take something to feed the animals even if the signs say do not feed animals it wasn t

 id=29505 title seppuku nonfiltered 79 processed 78 dbindex 1500079 seppuku japanese cutting the belly is a form of japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment seppuku is also known as hara kiri belly cutting and is written with the same kanji as seppuku but in reverse order with an okurigana in japanese hara kiri is a colloquialism seppuku being the more formal term samurai and modern adherents of bushido would use seppuku whereas ordinary japanese who in feudal times as well as today looked askance at the practice would use hara kiri hara kiri is the more common term in english the practice of committing seppuku at the death of one s master is known as oibara or or junshi the ritual is similar overview seppuku was a key part of bushido the code of the samurai warriors it was used by warriors to avoid falling into enemy hands and to attenuate shame samurai could also be ordered by their daimyo feudal lords to commit seppuku later disgraced warriors were sometimes allowed to commit seppuku rather than be executed in the normal manner since the main point of the act was to restore or protect one s honor as a warrior those who did not belong to the samurai caste were never ordered or expected to commit seppuku samurai women could only commit the act with permission in his book the samurai way of death samurai the world of the warrior ch 4 dr stephen turnbull states seppuku was commonly performed using a tant it could take place with preparation and ritual in the privacy of one s home or speedily in a quiet corner of a battlefield while one s comrades kept the enemy at bay in the world of the warrior seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated disgraced or mortally wounded it meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced the cutting of the abdomen released the samurai s spirit in the most dramatic fashion but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony sometimes a daimyo was called upon to perform seppuku as the basis of a peace agreement this would weaken the defeated clan so that resistance would effectively cease toyotomi hideyoshi used an enemy s suicide in this way on several occasions the most dramatic of which effectively ended a dynasty of daimyo forever when the h j were defeated at odawara in 1590 hideyoshi insisted on the suicide of the retired daimyo h j ujimasa and the exile of his son ujinao with one sweep of a sword the most powerful daimyo family in eastern japan was put to an end ritual in time committing seppuku came to involve a detailed ritual a samurai was bathed dressed in white robes fed his favourite meal and when he was finished his instrument was placed on his plate dressed ceremonially with his sword placed in front of him and sometimes seated on special cloths the warrior would prepare for death by writing a death poem with his selected attendant kaishakunin his second standing by he would open his kimono clothing take up his wakizashi short sword or a tant knife and plunge it into his abdomen making a left to right cut the kaishakunin would then perform daki kubi a cut in which the warrior was all but decapitated a slight band of flesh is left attaching the head to the body because of the precision necessary for such a maneuver the second was often a skilled swordsman the principal agreed in advance when the kaishaku made his cut usually as soon as the dagger was plunged into the abdomen this elaborate ritual evolved after seppuku had ceased being mainly a battlefield or wartime practice and become a para judicial institution see next section the second was usually but not always a friend if a defeated warrior had fought honorably and well an opponent who wanted to salute his bravery would volunteer to act as his second in the hagakure yamamoto tsunetomo wrote from ages past it has been considered ill omened by samurai to be requested as kaishaku the reason for this is that one gains no fame even if the job is well done and if by chance one should blunder it becomes a lifetime disgrace in the practice of past times there were instances when the head flew off it was said that it was best to cut leaving a little skin remaining so that it did not fly off in the direction of the verifying officials however at present it is best to cut clean through some samurai chose to perform a considerably more taxing form of seppuku known as j monji giri lit cross shaped cut in which there is no kaishakunin to put a quick end to the samurai s suffering it involves a second and more painful vertical cut across the belly a samurai performing jumonji giri was expected to bear his suffering quietly until perishing from loss of blood passing away with his hands over his face seppuku as capital punishment while the voluntary seppuku described above is the best known form and has been widely admired and idealized in practice the most common form of seppuku was obligatory seppuku used as a form of capital punishment for disgraced samurai especially for those who committed a serious offense such as unprovoked murder robbery corruption or treason the samurai were generally told of their offense in full and given a set time to commit seppuku usually before sunset on a given day if the sentenced was uncooperative it was not unheard of for them to be restrained or for the actual execution to be carried out by decapitation while retaining only the trappings of seppuku even the short sword laid out in front of the victim could be replaced with a fan unlike voluntary seppuku seppuku carried out as capital punishment did not necessarily absolve the victim s family of the crime depending on the severity of the crime half or all of the deceased s property could be confiscated and the family stripped of rank the western experience the first recorded time a westerner saw formal seppuku was the sakai incident of 1868 on february 15 twenty french sailors of the dupleix entered a japanese town called sakai without official permission their presence caused panic among the residents security forces were dispatched to turn the sailors back to their ship but a fight broke out and 11 sailors were shot dead upon the protest of the french representative compensation of 15 000 yen was paid and those responsible were sentenced to death the french captain was present to observe the execution as each samurai committed ritual disembowelment the gruesome nature of the act shocked the captain and he requested a pardon due to which nine of the samurai were spared this incident was dramatized in a famous short story sakai jiken by mori ogai in the 1860s the british ambassador to japan algernon bertram freeman mitford lord redesdale lived within sight of sengaku ji where the forty seven ronin are buried in his book tales of old japan he describes a man who had come to the graves to kill himself i will add one anecdote to show the sanctity which is attached to the graves of the forty seven in the month of september 1868 a certain man came to pray before the grave of oishi chikara having finished his prayers he deliberately performed hara kiri and the belly wound not being mortal dispatched himself by cutting his throat upon his person were found papers setting forth that being a ronin and without means of earning a living he had petitioned to be allowed to enter the clan of the prince of choshiu which he looked upon as the noblest clan in the realm his petition having been refused nothing remained for him but to die for to be a ronin was hateful to him and he would serve no other master than the prince of choshiu what more fitting place could he find in which to put an end to his life than the graveyard of these braves this happened at about two hundred yards distance from my house and when i saw the spot an hour or two later the ground was all bespattered with blood and disturbed by the death struggles of the man mitford also describes his friend s eyewitness account of a seppuku there are many stories on record of extraordinary heroism being displayed in the hara kiri the case of a young fellow only twenty years old of the choshiu clan which was told me the other day by an eye witness deserves mention as a marvellous instance of determination not content with giving himself the one necessary cut he slashed himself thrice horizontally and twice vertically then he stabbed himself in the throat until the dirk protruded on the other side with its sharp edge to the front setting his teeth in one supreme effort he drove the knife forward with both hands through his throat and fell dead during the meiji restoration the tokugawa shogun s aide committed seppuku one more story and i have done during the revolution when the taikun supreme commander beaten on every side fled ignominiously to yedo he is said to have determined to fight no more but to yield everything a member of his second council went to him and said sir the only way for you now to retrieve the honour of the family of tokugawa is to disembowel yourself and to prove to you that i am sincere and disinterested in what i say i am here ready to disembowel myself with you the taikun flew into a great rage saying that he would listen to no such nonsense and left the room his faithful retainer to prove his honesty retired to another part of the castle and solemnly performed the hara kiri in his book tales of old japan mitford describes witnessing a hara kiri as a corollary to the above elaborate statement of the ceremonies proper to be observed at the hara kiri i may here describe an instance of such an execution which i was sent officially to witness the condemned man was taki zenzaburo an officer of the prince of bizen who gave the order to fire upon the foreign settlement at hiogo in the month of february 1868 an attack to which i have alluded in the preamble to the story of the eta maiden and the hatamoto up to that time no foreigner had witnessed such an execution which was rather looked upon as a traveller s fable the ceremony which was ordered by the mikado himself took place at 10 30 at night in the temple of seifukuji the headquarters of the satsuma troops at hiogo a witness was sent from each of the foreign legations we were seven foreigners in all after another profound obeisance taki zenzaburo in a voice which betrayed just so much emotion and hesitation as might be expected from a man who is making a painful confession but with no sign of either in his face or manner spoke as follows i and i alone unwarrantably gave the order to fire on the foreigners at kobe and again as they tried to escape for this crime i disembowel myself and i beg you who are present to do me the honour of witnessing the act bowing once more the speaker allowed his upper garments to slip down to his girdle and remained naked to the waist carefully according to custom he tucked his sleeves under his knees to prevent himself from falling backwards for a noble japanese gentleman should die falling forwards deliberately with a steady hand he took the dirk that lay before him he looked at it wistfully almost affectionately for a moment he seemed to collect his thoughts for the last time and then stabbing himself deeply below the waist on the left hand side he drew the dirk slowly across to the right side and turning it in the wound gave a slight cut upwards during this sickeningly painful operation he never moved a muscle of his face when he drew out the dirk he leaned forward and stretched out his neck an expression of pain for the first time crossed his face but he uttered no sound at that moment the kaishaku who still crouching by his side had been keenly watching his every movement sprang to his feet poised his sword for a second in the air there was a flash a heavy ugly thud a crashing fall with one blow the head had been severed from the body a dead silence followed broken only by the hideous noise of the blood throbbing out of the inert heap before us which but a moment before had been a brave and chivalrous man it was horrible the kaishaku made a low bow wiped his sword with a piece of rice paper which he had ready for the purpose and retired from the raised floor and the stained dirk was solemnly borne away a bloody proof of the execution the two representatives of the mikado then left their places and crossing over to where the foreign witnesses sat called us to witness that the sentence of death upon taki zenzaburo had been faithfully carried out the ceremony being at an end we left the temple the ceremony to which the place and the hour gave an additional solemnity was characterised throughout by that extreme dignity and punctiliousness which are the distinctive marks of the proceedings of japanese gentlemen of rank and it is important to note this fact because it carries with it the conviction that the dead man was indeed the officer who had committed the crime and no substitute while profoundly impressed by the terrible scene it was impossible at the same time not to be filled with admiration of the firm and manly bearing of the sufferer and of the nerve with which the kaishaku performed his last duty to his master seppuku in modern japan seppuku as judicial punishment was officially abolished in 1873 shortly after the meiji restoration but voluntary seppuku did not completely die out dozens of people are known to have committed seppuku since then including some military men who committed suicide in 1895 as a protest against the return of a conquered territory to china by general nogi and his wife on the death of emperor meiji in 1912 and by numerous soldiers and civilians who chose to die rather than surrender at the end of world war ii in 1970 famed author yukio mishima and one of his followers committed public seppuku at the japan self defense forces headquarters after an unsuccessful attempt to incite the armed forces to stage a coup d état mishima committed seppuku in the office of general kanetoshi mashita his second a 25 year old named masakatsu morita tried three times to ritually behead mishima but failed his head was finally severed by hiroyasu koga morita then attempted to commit seppuku himself although his own cuts were too shallow to be fatal he gave the signal and he too was beheaded by koga in 1999 masaharu nonaka a 58 year old employee of bridgestone in japan slashed his belly with a sashimi knife to protest his forced retirement he died later in the hospital this suicide which became widely known as risutora seppuku

 id=166162 title islamic philosophy nonfiltered 94 processed 92 dbindex 1500094 islamic philosophy is a branch of islamic studies and is a longstanding attempt to create harmony between philosophy reason and the religious teachings of islam faith definition the attempt to fuse religion and philosophy is difficult because there are no clear preconditions philosophers typically hold that one must accept the possibility of truth from any source and follow the argument wherever it leads on the other hand classical religious believers have a set of religious principles that they hold to be unchallengeable fact given these divergent goals and views some hold that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of islam which is believed to be a revealed religion by its adherents in this view all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail however others believe that a synthesis between islam and philosophy is possible one way to find a synthesis is to use philosophical arguments to prove that one s preset religious principles are true this is a common technique found in the writings of many religious traditions including judaism christianity and islam but this is not generally accepted as true philosophy by philosophers another way to find a synthesis is to abstain from holding as true any religious principles of one s faith at all unless one independently comes to those conclusions from a philosophical analysis however this is not generally accepted as being faithful to one s religion by adherents of that religion a third rarer and more difficult path is to apply analytical philosophy to one s own religion in this case a religious person would also be a philosopher by asking questions such as what is the nature of god how do we know that god exists what is the nature of revelation how do we know that god reveals his will to mankind what is the nature of divinely guided messengers vis à vis philosophers what is the nature of imamat or vicegerency of humans on earth which of our religious traditions must be interpreted literally which of our religious traditions must be interpreted allegorically what must one actually believe to be considered a true adherent of our religion how can one reconcile the findings of philosophy with religion how can one reconcile the findings of science with religion introduction islamic philosophy may be defined in a number of different ways but the perspective taken here is that it represents the style of philosophy produced within the framework of islamic culture this description does not suggest that it is necessarily concerned with religious issues nor even that it is exclusively produced by muslims leaman routledge encyclopedia of philosophy formative influences islamic philosophy as the name implies refers to philosophical activity within the islamic milieu the main sources of classical or early islamic philosophy are the religion of islam itself especially ideas derived and interpreted from quran greek philosophy which the early muslims inherited as a result of conquests when alexandria syria and jundishapur came under muslim rule along with pre islamic iranian and indian philosophy many of the early philosophical debates centered around reconciling religion and reason the latter exemplified by greek philosophy early and classical islamic philosophy in early islamic thought two main currents may be distinguished the first is kalam that mainly dealt with theological questions and the other is falsafa that was founded on the reception of greek thought kalam independent minds exploiting the methods of ijtihad sought to investigate the doctrines of the qur an which until then had been accepted in faith on the authority of divine revelation one of first debates was that between partisan of the qadar arabic qadara to have power who affirmed free will and the jabarites jabar force constraint who maintained the belief in fatalism at the second century of the hegira a new movement arose in the theological school of basra iraq a pupil wasil ibn ata who was expelled from the school because his answers were contrary to then orthodox islamic tradition and became leader of a new school and systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects particularly those of the qadarites this new school was called mutazilite from i tazala to separate oneself to dissent its principal dogmas were three god is an absolute unity and no attribute can be ascribed to him man is a free agent it is on account of these two principles that the mu tazilites designate themselves the partisans of justice and unity all knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason humans could acquire knowledge before as well as after revelation by the sole light of reason this fact makes knowledge obligatory upon all men at all times and in all places the mutazilites compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox islam of their day looked for support in philosophy and are one of the first to pursue a rational theology called ilm al kalam scholastic theology those professing it were called mutakallamin this appellation became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles the first mutakallamin had to debate both the orthodox and the non muslims and they may be described as occupying the middle ground between those two parties but subsequent generations were to large extent critical towards the mutazilite school especially after formation of the asharite concepts falsafa from the ninth century onward owing to caliph al ma mun and his successor greek philosophy was introduced among the persians and arabs and the peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them such were al kindi al farabi ibn sina avicenna and ibn rushd averroës all of whose fundamental principles were considered as criticized by the mutakallamin during the abbasid caliphate a number of thinkers and scientists many of them non muslims or heretical muslims played a role in transmitting greek hindu and other pre islamic knowledge to the christian west they contributed to making aristotle known in christian europe three speculative thinkers the two persians al farabi and avicenna and the arab al kindi combined aristotelianism and neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through islam they were considered by many as highly unorthodox and by some were even described as non islamic philosophers from spain arabic philosophic literature was translated into hebrew and latin contributing to the development of modern european philosophy the philosophers moses maimonides a jew born in muslim spain and precursor of sociology and historiography ibn khaldun born in modern day tunisia were also important some differences between kalam and falsafa aristotle attempted to demonstrate the unity of god but from the view which he maintained that matter was eternal it followed that god could not be the creator of the world to assert that god s knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe and not to individual and accidental things is tantamount to denying prophecy one other point shocked the faith of the mutakallamin the theory of intellect the peripatetics taught that the human soul was only an aptitude a faculty capable of attaining every variety of passive perfection and that through information and virtue it became qualified for union with the active intellect which latter emanates from god to admit this theory would be to deny the immortality of the soul wherefore the mutakallamin had before anything else to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by democritus they taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor extension originally atoms were created by god and are created now as occasion seems to require bodies come into existence or die through the aggregation or the sunderance of these atoms but this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter for indeed if it be supposed that god commenced his work at a certain definite time by his will and for a certain definite object it must be admitted that he was imperfect before accomplishing his will or before attaining his object in order to obviate this difficulty the motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to time and claimed that just as space is constituted of atoms and vacuum time likewise is constituted of small indivisible moments the creation of the world once established it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a creator and that god is unique omnipotent and omniscient jewish philosophy in the arab world in the classical period the oldest jewish religio philosophical work preserved is that of saadia gaon 892 942 emunot ve deot the book of beliefs and opinions in this work saadia treats the questions that interested the mutakallamin such as the creation of matter the unity of god the divine attributes the soul etc saadia criticizes other philosophers severely for saadia there was no problem as to creation god created the world ex nihilo just as the bible attests and he contests the theory of the mutakallamin in reference to atoms which theory he declares is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter to prove the unity of god saadia uses the demonstrations of the mutakallamin only the attributes of essence sifat al dhatia can be ascribed to god but not the attributes of action sifat al fi aliya the soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres here saadia controverts the mutakallamin who considered the soul an accident arad compare guide for the perplexed i 74 and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position only a substance can be the substratum of an accident that is of a non essential property of things saadia argues if the soul be an accident only it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom joy love etc saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the kalam and if at times he deviated from its doctrines it was owing to his religious views just as the jewish and muslim peripatetics stopped short in their respective aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion main protagonists of falsafa and their critics the twelfth century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the kalam which latter being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox perished for lack of champions this supreme exaltation of philosophy may be attributed in great measure to al ghazali 1005 1111 among the persians and to judah ha levi 1140 among the jews it can be argued that the attacks directed against the philosophers by ghazali in his work tahafut al falasifa the destruction of the philosophers not only produced by reaction a current favorable to philosophy but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism they thereafter made their theories clearer and their logic closer the influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the islamic peripatetic school ever produced namely ibn bajjah avempace and ibn rushd averroes both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy since no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on persian or arabian soil without leaving its impress on the jews the persian ghazali found an imitator in the person of judah ha levi this poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy and to this end wrote the kuzari in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike he passes severe censure upon the mutakallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy he says i consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them kuzari v then he reduced the chief propositions of the mutakallamin to prove the unity of god to ten in number describing them at length and concluding in these terms does the kalam give us more information concerning god and his attributes than the prophet did ib iii and iv aristotelianism finds no favor in judah ha levi s eyes for it is no less given to details and criticism neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament ibn rushd or ibn roshd or averroës the contemporary of maimonides closed the first great philosophical era of the muslims the boldness of this great commentator of aristotle aroused the full fury of the orthodox who in their zeal attacked all philosophers indiscriminately and had all philosophical writings committed to the flames the theories of ibn rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of ibn bajjah and ibn tufail who only follow the teachings of ibn sina and al farabi like all islamic peripatetics ibn rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world hypotheses which in the mind of the arabic philosophers did away with the dualism involved in aristotle s doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter but while al farabi ibn sina and other persian and muslim philosophers hurried so to speak over subjects that trenched on religious dogmas ibn rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress thus he says not only is matter eternal but form is potentially inherent in matter otherwise it were a creation ex nihilo munk mélanges p 444 according to this theory therefore the existence of this world is not only a possibility as ibn sina declared in order to make concessions to the orthodox but also a necessity driven from the islamic schools islamic philosophy found a refuge with the jews to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the christian world a series of eminent men such as the ibn tibbons narboni gersonides joined in translating the arabic philosophical works into hebrew and commenting upon them the works of ibn rushd especially became the subject of their study due in great measure to maimonides who in a letter addressed to his pupil joseph ibn aknin spoke in the highest terms of ibn rushd s commentary it should be mentioned that this depiction of intellectual tradition in islamic lands is mainly dependent upon what west could understand or was willing to understand from this long era in contrast there are some historians and philosophers who do not agree with this account and describe this era in a completely different way their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on islamic philosophy especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as ibn sina and of western thinkers such as ibn rushd for more discussion refer to the history of islamic philosophy by henry corbin later islamic philosophy the death of ibn rushd effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of islamic philosophy usually called the peripatetic arabic school and philosophical activity declined significantly in western islamic countries namely in spain and north africa though it persisted for much longer in the eastern countries in particular iran and india since the political power shift in western europe spain and portugal from muslim to christian control the muslims naturally did not practice philosophy in western europe this also led to some loss of contact between the west and the east of the islamic world muslims in the east continued to do philosophy as is evident from the works of ottoman scholars and especially those living in muslim kingdoms within the territories of present day iran and india such as shah waliullah and ahmad sirhindi this fact has escaped most pre modern historians of islamic or arabic philosophy in addition logic has continued to be taught in religious seminaries up to modern times after ibn rushd there arose many later schools of islamic philosophy we can mention just a few such as the those founded by ibn arabi suhrawardi and mulla sadra these new schools are of particular importance as they are still active in the islamic world post classical iranian muslim philosophy post classical islamic philosophers are usually divided into two main categories according to their affiliation with the sunni and shia denominations of course there are many contemporary philosophers and thinkers such as professor nasr and imam musa sadr who do not accept the importance of this classification but there is a consensus that we can categorize this era according to the two main approaches thinkers who mainly worked within the shi a tradition and thinkers who did not if we accept this division then we can summarize each category as follows it should be mentioned that this classification has many overlaps is not very clear and precise thinkers

indian sub continent in the early 20th century beside his urdu and persian poetical work the reconstruction of religious thought in islam is a milestone in the modern political philosophy of islam in contemporary islamic lands the teaching of hikmat or hikmah has continued and flourished among the traditional masters of islamic philosophy most active during the past two decades may be mentioned the iranian or allameh tabatabaei the author of numerous works including the twenty seven volume quranic commentary al mizan sayyid abul hasan rafi i qazwini the great master of mulla sadra s school

 id=295228 title cholo nonfiltered 153 processed 151 dbindex 1500156 cholo is an alternate name for the emberá languages for the 1986 video game see cholo computer game cholo is an english and spanish language word which broadly is applied to persons of mixed amerindian and spanish ancestry however its precise usage has varied widely in different times and places it is used in the masculine and neuter the feminine form in spanish and sometimes in english is chola origin and history the term is used in a book los comentarios reales del inca garcilazo de la vega a writer from peru published in 1609 and 1616 he writes in spanish cholo is a word from the windward islands it means dog not of the purebred variety the spaniards use it for insult and vituperation in colonial mexico the terms cholo and coyote co existed indicating mixed spanish and amerindian ancestry or a poor background or both cholo as an english language term dates at least to the early 1900s isela alexsandra garcia of the university of california at berkeley writes that the term can be traced to mexico where in the early part of the last century it referred to culturally marginal mestizos or people of mixed spanish and native american origin she cites james diego vigil s barrio gangs street life and identity in southern california as a source an article in the los angeles express of april 2 1907 headlined cleaning up the filthy cholo courts has begun in earnest uses the terms cholos and mexicans interchangeably the term cholo courts was defined in the journal of san diego history as sometimes little more than instant slums as shanties were strewn almost randomly around city lots in order to create cheap horizontal tenements the term in these articles indicates that it means simply poor mexicans the term has two somewhat different meanings one in the united states canada and mexico and another in the rest of the americas in modern times unattested references on the internet often copied word for word from one site to another have stated essentially as follows mexico and north in mexico and north cholo is a term implying a typically mexican mestizo gangster a cholo is stereotypically depicted as wearing baggy chinos khaki pants or khaki shorts with white knee high socks so called wifebeater undershirts flannel shirts buttoned all the way to the top or unbuttoned except for the top button and a shaved head or slicked back hair popular cholo brands include dickies and ben davis this same designation may also be associated with black ink tattoos commonly involving gang calligraphy or family names and art a cholo might also stereotypically own a lowrider prefer music like zapp and roger s more bounce to the ounce and doo wa ditty he might also employ the chicano term of ese in a way to call someone dude like what s up ese or órale ese this word in spanish means that one or that guy but it also is the letter s which some have said stands for sureño a member of a certain street gang another term with essentially the same meaning is vato which can be used in the same way it is this particular image that cheech marin drew on in the cheech and chong films there is also a reference to the cholo in assault on precinct 13 in the 2004 film napoleon dynamite nano and arturo de silva play characters simply referred to as cholo no 1 and cholo no 2 in the videogame grand theft auto vice city stories there is a street gang called the cholos who resemble the stereotypical gangster image of a cholo the usage was reportedly more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s than today though the usage was still fairly widespread in some areas in the 1990s in south texas cholos are sometimes referred to as chongers in the english speaking world of the united states the word is most primarily and heavily used in caló slang but it in turn has infiltrated into mainstream american english use most specifically the term cholo when used in american english is likely to be done so by people associated with american youth movements such as the chicano mexican american white black lowrider subcultures african american gangsters of the western united states or the hip hop scene in general racial and cultural status along with social class are reflected in the term cholo itself which was adopted in california in the 1960s by youth following the pachuco tradition as a label for that identity cuellar 1982 in 1571 fray alonso de molina in his nahuatl vocabulary vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana y mexicana y castellana defined the word xolo as slave servant or waiter the porrúa dictionary defines cholo as used in the americas as a civilized indian or a half breed or mestizo of a european father and indian mother the word has historically been used along the borderland as a derogatory term to mean lower class mexican migrants and in the rest of latin america to mean an acculturating indian or peasant cuellar 1982 3 to explain the stigma accruing to the indian component of the term cholo it is useful to look at another word containing assessments of racial and cultural identity indio the spanish word for indian which in mexico conveys two principal images first there is the image of indian identity communicated in nationalist discourse taught to children in elementary school about the brave and noble indian heritage of mexicans however another definition seems more pervasive on an every day basis in popular discourse and that is the use of the term indio as a common insult to mean dumb uncivilized or unsophisticated this is also implied in widely used popular phrases such as acaba de bajar del cerro someone who just came down out of the hills or trae el nopal en la frente the image of a person with a prickly pear cactus on his or her forehead the cactus of course is one of the elements in the symbol of the aztecs and appears in the national seal on the mexican flag these phrases ostensibly refer to mexican identity but do not appear to be used to refer to persons of primarily european descent and cultural background rather they refer to the peasant population of the ranchos despite or because of its long history of denigrating semantics the term cholo was turned on its head and used as a symbol of pride in the context of the ethnic power movements of the 1960s cummings 2004 south of mexico under the caste system of colonial latin america the term cholo originally applied to the children resulting from the union of a mestizo and an amerindian that is someone of three quarters amerindian and one quarter spanish ancestry more precisely the term was specific to the viceroyalty of peru and neighbouring andean regions of south america in el salvador the word cholo means big large grande during the colonial era a myriad of other terms mestizo castizo chamizo etc were in use to denote other individuals of european amerindian ancestry in ratios smaller or greater of spanish to amerindian ancestry the term is most commonly associated with peru and bolivia peru bolivia and ecuador in modern day peru and bolivia cholo is still a widely used term which refers to people with noticeably greater amounts of amerindian than european ancestry among peruvians the term mestizo which in other latin american countries is usually used for those of relatively equal amounts of spanish to amerindian ancestry has also become increasingly common in recent years the meaning of cholo has further shifted to include a vast number of people of exclusively native american ancestry in this latter context the term often implies indigenous people who have attained a higher social status by moving from the rural or interior regions of the country to the urban areas and cities have taken up western hispanic mestizo cultural practices are bilingual fluent in both spanish and an amerindian language but deny any knowledge of a native language downplay their native descendance and identify solely with their newly adopted cultural norms in that latter context the usage is somewhat pejorative during his winning presidential campaign the former president of peru alejandro toledo successfully reached out to the largest segment of the peruvian population 45 percent of which is composed of indigenous peruvians in addition to the cholos by proclaiming his indigenous heritage and identifying himself as a cholo spanish language media played on this title and referred to him as el cholo throughout the campaign and in the initial stages of his presidency in ecuador cholo is also used to denote a greater affinity for amerindian than spanish heritage for mixed race people unlike the way in which the term is used in other countries the affinity is cultural not one based on a person s looks cholos in ecuador reside typically in communities whose members are actually mestizos whose ancestry is both spanish and amerindian often greater spanish than amerindian yet apart from their apparent spanish descent and monolingualism in spanish their garb culture and customs their traditional occupations and many times their surnames are more typical of highland quichua amerindians than of spaniards this circumstance is in contrast to the evolution of mestizo identity and life throughout the rest of latin america where the emphasis has always been placed solely on the spanish side a widely known example of the former are the cholas cuencanas from the colonial city of cuenca in the southern region of that country when not specifically referring to the above mentioned mestizo communities the term cholo may also have the same connotations of greater amerindian ancestry than spanish of a mixed race person as it does in other andean countries the term as used in ecuador is used as a supposedly neutral term to designate the group described above it is used however as a pejorative term to generalize someone who is low class a designation usually reserved for those of greater amerindian admixture chile and argentina in chile and argentina cholo also at times may connote a person of unmixed amerindian ancestry or predominantly amerindian appearance in chile the term is used almost exclusively to refer to peruvians and bolivians it is usually intended as an insult it may also be applied to anyone of unmixed amerindian ancestry or predominantly amerindian appearance except if the person is a fellow chilean cholo and chola are also commonly used as nicknames not only for those who would be considered cholos it is not considered a negative epithet and may be known or used only as a nickname such as the case of argentine football soccer player cholo simeone references 5 cuellar j the rise and spread of cholismo as a border youth subculture presentation delivered at the

to that magazine became one of his favorite writers as a teenager bloch befriended and corresponded with lovecraft who gave the promising youngster advice on his own fiction writing efforts bloch s first professional sales at the age of just seventeen were to weird tales with the short stories the feast in the abbey and the secret in the tomb bloch s early stories were strongly influenced by lovecraft and a number of his stories were set in and extended the world of lovecraft s cthulhu mythos it was bloch who invented for example the oft cited mythos texts de vermis mysteriis and cultes des goules the young bloch even appears thinly disguised as the character robert blake in lovecraft s story the haunter of the dark which is dedicated to bloch in this story lovecraft kills off the bloch character repaying a courtesy bloch paid lovecraft with his tale the shambler from the stars in which the lovecraft inspired figure dies the story goes so far as to use bloch s then current

began contributing to other pulps such as the science fiction magazine amazing stories he gradually evolved away from lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own one of the first distinctly blochian stories was yours truly jack the ripper which was published in weird tales in 1943 the story was bloch s take on the jack the ripper legend and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half historic half legendary figures such as the man in the iron mask iron mask 1944 the marquis de sade the skull of the marquis de sade 1945 and lizzie borden lizzie borden took an axe 1946 politics in 1939 bloch was contacted by james doolittle

instance the original releasing balloons from the ceiling shtick he comments bitterly on how after zeidler s victory they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries he ends the story with a wryly philosophical point if carl zeidler had not asked jim doolittle to manage his campaign doolittle would never have contacted me about it and the only reason doolittle knew me to begin with was because he read my yarn the cloak in unknown rattling this chain of circumstances one may stretch it a bit further if i had not written a little vampire story called the cloak carl zeidler might never

 id=2709616 title sodium pertechnetate nonfiltered 160 processed 158 dbindex 1500163 sodium pertechnetate sodium tetraoxotechnetate vii is an ionic salt of sodium and pertechnetate 99mtco4 is the basis of a family of radioactive pharmaceuticals approved for diagnostic use the advantages to 99mtc include its short half life of 6 hours low radiation exposure to the patient and ability to effectively detect emitted gamma radiation the short half life of 99mtc and the absence of radiation damage to tissues allow a patient to be injected with activities of more than 30 millicuries however the half life is long enough that labelling synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical and scintigraphic measurements can be performed without losing much activity the energy emitted from 99mtc is 140 kev which allows for the study of deep body organs the pertechnetate ion is primarily used in thyroid imaging because and iodide due to similar charge radius ratio are similarly incorporated into the thyroid gland however the pertechnetate ion is not incorporated into the thyroglobulin 1 chemistry the only tetrahedral oxoanion of technetium is the basic starting material for all technetate chemistry pertechnetate salts are usually colorless 9 is produced by oxidizing technetium with nitric acid hydrogen peroxide the pertechnetate anion is similar to the permanganate anion but is a weaker oxidizing agent the standard electrode potential for tco4 tco2 is only 0 738 v in acidic solution as compared to 1 695 v for mno4 mno2 1 because of its diminished oxidizing powers is stable in alkaline solution is more similar to reo4 depending of the reducing agent can be converted to derivatives containing tc vi tc v and tc iv 6 in the absence of strong complexing ligands tco4 is reduced to a 4 oxidation state via the formation of tco2 hydrate 1 pharmaceutical use1 radiopharmaceuticals have no intended pharmacologic effect and are used in very low concentrations radiopharmaceuticals containing 99mtc are currently being applied in the determining morphology of organs testing of organ function and scintigraphic and emission tomographic imaging the gamma radiation emitted by the radionuclide allows organs to be imaged in vivo tomographically currently over 80 of radiopharmaceuticals used clinically are labelled with 99mtc a majority of radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 99mtc are synthesized by the reduction of the pertechnetate ion in the presence of ligands chosen to confer organ specificity of the drug the resulting 99mtc compound is then injected into the body and a gamma camera is focused on sections or planes in order to image the spacial distribution of the 99mtc 99mtc is used primarily in the study of the thyroid gland its morphology vascularity and function it is also used in the study of blood perfusion regional accumulation and cerebral lesions in the brain as it accumulates primarily in the choroid plexus sodium pertechnetate cannot pass through the blood brain barrier but can be used when this barrier is damaged 99mtco4 is not organically bound to the target organs of the body once sodium pertechnetate is injected into the body it becomes localized in the salivary and thyroid glands and the stomach 99mtco4 is rapidly excreted and kidney is the main path of eliminating technetium for the first three days after being injected after a scanning is performed it is recommended that a patient drink a large amount of water in order to expedite elimiation of the technetium radionuclide 2 other methods of 99mtco4 administration include intraperitoneal intramuscular subcutaneous as well as orally the behavior of the 99mtco4 ion is essentially the same with small differences due to the difference in rate of absorption regardless of the method of administration 4 preparation of 99mtco4 99mtc is made readily and conveniently available in high nuclidic purity through the decay of molybdenum 99 which decays with 87 probability to 99mtc the subsequent decay of 99mtc leads to either 99tc or 99rb 99mo is obtained in a nuclear reactor via irradiation of either molybdenum 98 or naturally occurring molybdenum with thermal neutrons 99mtc is also obtained by the fission of 235u or 239pu 3 but the isolation of 99mtc requires many steps due to the presence of other fission products and transuranium elements 1 once 99mtc is formed it can be separated from 99mo by column chromatography in a few cases sublimation or solvent extration may be used the pertechnetate ion is formed by using acidic aluminum oxide as the packing material for the column at the top of the column is bound 99moo42 99mtco4 is extracted from the column by washing with a 0 15 m nacl saline solution the eluate from the column must be sterile and pyrogen free so that the tc drug can be used directly usually within 12 h of elution 1 synthesis of 99mtco4 radiopharmaceuticals1 99mtco4 is advantageous for the synthesis of a variety of radiopharmaceuticals because tc can adopt a number of oxidation states the oxidation state and coligands dictate the specificity of the radiopharmaceutical the starting material for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals is na99mtco4 made available after elution from the generator column as mentioned above the na99mtco4 can be reduced in the presence of complexing ligands many different reducing agents can be used but transition metal reductants are avoided because they compete with 99mtc for ligands oxalates formates hydroxylamine and hydrazine are also avoided because they also complex with the 99mtc electrochemical reduction of 99mtco4 is avoided in clinical practice because it requires excessive equipment examples of organ specific radiopharmaceuticals include a technetium complex that can penetrate the blood brain barrier in which 99mtco4 reduced with tin ii in the presence of the ligand d l hm pao to form tco d l hm pao hm pao is hexamethylpropyleneamino oxime a technetium complex that is used to image the lungs tc maa is formed from the reduction of 99mtco4 with sncl2 in the presence of human serum albumin which is both water and air stable can be directly synthesized from 99mtco4 in saline under 1 atm of co this compound can be easily substituted with various biomolecules allowing this compound to be a precursor to complexes that can be used in cancer diagnosis and therapy involving dna dna pretargeting 5 ideally the synthesis of the desired radiopharmaceutical from 99mtco4 a reducing agent and desired ligands should occur in one step after elution and the reaction must be performed in a solvent that can be injected intravenously such as a saline solution kits are available that contain the reducing agent usually tin ii and ligands these kits are sterile pyrogen free easily purchased and can be stored for long periods of time the reaction with 99mtco4 takes place directly after elution from the generator column and shortly before its intended use a high organ specificity is important because the injected activity should accumulate in the organ under investigation as there should be a high activity ratio of the target organ to nontarget organs if there is a high activity in organs adjacent to the one under investigation the image of the target organ can be highly obscured also high organ specificity allows for the reduction of the injected activity and thus the exposure to radiation in the patient the radiopharmaceutical must be kinetically inert in that it must not change chemically in vivo en route to the target organ other reactions involving the pertechnetate ion radiolysis of tco4 in nitrate solutions proceeds through the reduction to tco42 which induces complex disproportionation processes tco4 eaq tco42 2tco42 tco4 tc v 2tc v tco42 tc iv tc v tco42 tc iv tco4 pertechnetate can be reduced by h2s to give tc2s7 10 pertechnetate is also be reduced to tc iv v compounds in alkaline solutions in nuclear waste tanks without adding catalytic metals reducing agents or external radiation reactions of mono and disaccharides with 99mtco4 yield tc iv compounds that are water soluble 8 references 1 schwochau k 1994

 id=2540987 title dog health nonfiltered 167 processed 165 dbindex 1500170 the domestic dog s health is possibly one of the best studied areas in veterinary medicine since the dog has had such a long and close relationship with humans diseases and ailments some diseases ailments and poisons are common to both humans and dogs others are different transferable diseases most diseases that affect dogs or humans are not transferable between the two species there are some exceptions of zoonoses rabies or hydrophobia is an almost invariably fatal disease which can be transmitted to dogs or humans by the bite of an infected mammal possibly a dog s cat s raccoon s or bat s although rodents and similar small mammals can be infected with the disease artificially they are generally not found infected in the wild the current hypothesis is that they are not likely to survive any attack that would infect them animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to behave bizarrely and often aggressively increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a person and transmit the disease areas that are rabies free usually islands such as britain ireland australia and the american state of hawaii have strict quarantine laws to keep their territories rabies free these require long periods of isolation and observation of imported animals which makes them unattractive places to move with a pet unless the pet is quite young areas that are not rabies free usually require that dogs and often cats be vaccinated against rabies a person or dog bitten by an unknown dog or other animal should always be treated without waiting for symptoms given the potentially fatal consequences of a rabid biter there has been only one case of someone surviving rabies when treatment was not begun until after symptoms appeared the biter should be apprehended if possible as only autopsy of the brain can determine if it was rabid this should be a great incentive to dog owners to vaccinate their dogs even if they feel the risk of their dog contracting rabies is low since vaccination will eliminate the need for their dog to be euthanized and examined in this fashion should it bite anyone or be suspected of biting anyone this applies to dogs that are showing neurological signs at the time of the bite unvaccinated healthy dogs need to be confined for ten days from the time of the bite at home or at a veterinarian depending on state law if the dog is not showing signs of rabies at the end of ten days then the bitten person could not have been exposed to rabies dogs and cats do not have the rabies virus in their saliva until a few days prior to showing symptoms ten day confinement does not apply to other species a dog or cat bitten by a wild animal in an area known to have rabies should be confined for six months because it can take that long for symptoms to start parasites particularly intestinal worms such as hookworms tapeworms and roundworms can be transmitted in a dog s feces some tapeworms have fleas as intermediate hosts the worm egg must be consumed by a flea to hatch then the infected flea must be ingested usually by the dog while grooming itself but occasionally by a human through various means for the adult worm to establish itself in the intestines the worm s eggs then pass through the intestines and adhere to the nether regions of the dog and the cycle begins again fleas and ticks of various species can be acquired and brought home by a dog where they can multiply and attack humans and vice versa this is particularly important now that tick borne lyme disease has become endemic throughout a large area in addition to other similar diseases such as rocky mountain spotted fever although dogs do not seem to be as susceptible to such diseases as humans similar rickettsial diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such mechanisms as a dog killing an infected rabbit then shaking itself off in the house near enough to its owners to fatally infect most of the family leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals it is caused by bacteria of the genus leptospira humans and dogs become infected through contact with water food or soil containing urine from infected animals this may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact especially with mucosal surfaces such as the eyes or nose or with broken skin genetic ailments genetic conditions are a problem in some dogs particularly purebreeds for this reason many of the national kennel clubs require dogs to not have certain genetic illnesses in order to be registered this is most common for hip dysplasia though it has not had optimal results some of the most common conditions include hip dysplasia is a common problem that primarily affects larger breeds hip dysplasia is a defect in the hip joint which can depending on the degree of hip luxation be quite painful to the dog as it grows to adult size over time it often causes arthritis in the hips luxating patellas can be a problem for smaller breeds it can cause lameness and pain in the hind legs genes for blindness or deafness seem to be carried by some breeds in some dogs such as collies the blue merle or harlequin coloring is actually the heterozygote of a partially recessive gene preventing proper development of the nervous system therefore if two such dogs are mated on the average one quarter of the puppies will have severe genetic defects in their nervous systems and sensory organs ranging from deafness to fatal flaws parasites several types of parasites are commonly associated with dogs intestinal worms cause varying degrees of discomfort heartworm is a dog parasitoid it is hard to eliminate and can be fatal prevention however is easily achieved using medication as the name suggests an infected mosquito injects a larva into the dog s skin where it migrates to the circulatory system and takes up residence in the pulmonary arteries and heart growing and reproducing to an alarming degree the effects on the dog are quite predictable cardiac failure over a year or two leading to death treatment of an infected dog is difficult involving an attempt to poison the healthy worm with arsenic compounds without killing the weakened dog and frequently does not succeed prevention is much the better course via heartworm pills which are fed to the dog and contain a compound which kills the larvae immediately upon infection without harming the dog often they are available combined with other parasite preventives hydatidosis is caused by a cestode echinococcus this is usually noticed among dogs wild dogs foxes etc due to its importance as a zoonosis these worms are important to treat preventing hydatidosis is an easier task than treating the same anthelmintics such as praziquantel may help prevent this condition prohibition of the feeding of dogs with uncooked offals may be the best prophylactic measure against these tapeworms fleas and ticks are common parasites for which there are many effective preventive measures various mites cause skin problems such as mange poisons dangerous foods some foods commonly enjoyed by humans are dangerous to dogs dogs love the flavor of chocolate but chocolate in sufficient doses is lethally toxic to dogs and horses and possibly cats chocolate contains theobromine a chemical stimulant that together with caffeine and theophylline belongs to the group of methylxanthine alkaloids dogs are unable to metabolize theobromine effectively if they eat chocolate the theobromine can remain in their bloodstreams for up to 20 hours and these animals may experience fast heart rate hallucinations severe diarrhea epileptic seizures heart attacks internal bleeding and eventually death a chocolate bar can be sufficient to make a small dog extremely ill or even kill it approximately thirty grams of baking chocolate per kilogram 1 2 ounce per pound of body weight is enough to be poisonous in case of accidental intake of chocolate by especially a smaller dog contact a veterinarian or animal poison control immediately it is commonly recommended to induce vomiting within two hours of ingestion large breeds are less susceptible to chocolate poisoning but still are far less tolerant of the substance than humans are note carob treats are often available as dog treats these are unrelated to chocolate and are safe it has recently been confirmed that grapes and raisins can cause acute renal failure in dogs the exact mechanism is not known nor any means to determine the susceptibility of an individual dog however one vet believes it may be an acute auto immune response to plant borne viruses in the same manner as fip in cats while as little as one raisin can be fatal to a susceptible ten pound dog many other dogs have eaten as much as a pound of grapes or raisins at a time without ill effects the dog usually vomits a few hours after consumption and begins showing signs of renal failure three to five days later onions and to a significantly lesser extent garlic contain thiosulfate which causes hemolytic anemia in dogs and cats thiosulfate levels are not affected by cooking or processing small puppies have died of hemolytic anemia after being fed baby food containing onion powder occasional exposure to small amounts is usually not a problem but continuous exposure to even small amounts can be a serious threat garlic is also known to cause diarrhoea and vomiting macadamia nuts can cause stiffness tremors hyperthermia and abdominal pain the exact mechanism is not known most dogs recover with supportive care when the source of exposure is removed alcoholic beverages pose much the same temptation and hazard to dogs as to humans a drunk dog displays behavior analogous to that of an intoxicated person however beer presents another problem see below hops the plant used to make common beer can cause malignant hyperthermia in dogs usually with fatal results certain breeds such as greyhounds seem particularly sensitive to hop toxicity but hops should be kept away from all dogs even small amounts of hops can trigger a potentially deadly reaction even if the hops are spent after use in brewing some dogs have food allergies much as humans do this is particular to the dog and not characteristic of the species as a whole an example is a dog vomiting whenever he eats salmon many humans likewise have seafood allergies common household substances some common household chemicals are particularly dangerous to dogs antifreeze due to its sweet taste poses an extreme danger of poisoning to a dog or cat that either drinks from a spill or licks it off its fur the antifreeze itself is not toxic but is metabolized in the liver to a compound which causes kidney failure and eventual seizures and death by the time symptoms are observed the kidneys are usually too damaged for the dog to survive so acting quickly is important immediate treatment is to administer apomorphine or peroxide solution in an effort to get the animal to vomit up as much of the antifreeze as possible next it is critical to immediately get the animal to a veterinarian fomepizole antizol vet by orphan medical is considered the preferred treatment for treating ethylene glycol toxicoses in dogs ethanol can also be used in cats and dogs however it does have several unfavorable side effects ethanol occupies the enzymes in the dog s liver long enough for the unmetabolized antifreeze to be passed out harmlessly through the kidneys dogs should not be allowed access to any place in which an antifreeze leak or spill has happened until the spill is completely cleaned out even a very small amount such as a tablespoon can easily prove fatal some brands of antifreeze that contain propylene glycol instead of ethylene glycol are marketed as being less harmful or less attractive to animals mouse and rat poison is commonly found in the house or garage dogs readily eat these poisons which look like small green blocks and are very attractive to them the poisons work by depleting stores of vitamin k in the body without which blood can not clot properly symptoms of poisoning include depression weakness difficulty breathing bruising and bleeding from any part of the body these symptoms often take 3 to 4 days to show up a blood test will show that the blood is not clotting properly if the poison has only recently been ingested within 2 to 3 hours the dog should be given apomorphine or hydrogen peroxide to make it vomit activated charcoal can be given to absorb any remaining poison in the gastrointestinal tract then the dog is given vitamin k supplementation for 3 to 4 weeks depending on the type of poison at the end of treatment the clotting times should be tested again the prognosis is good in these cases however if the dog is already showing signs of poisoning it is too late to try and remove the poison from the body a whole blood transfusion or plasma is given to treat the anemia and to try and control bleeding vitamin k is also given the prognosis is poor in these cases mouse and rat poisons containing cholecalciferol cause hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in dogs symptoms include depression loss of appetite vomiting blood weakness and shock treatment is as above for recent exposure when hypercalcemia occurs which can take 1 to 2 weeks treatment is with intravenous fluids saline diuretics corticosteroids and calcitonin long term prognosis is good once the dog is stabilized zinc toxicity mostly in the form of the ingestion of us pennies minted after 1982 is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia over the counter medications a veterinarian should be checked before any otc medicine is used however poisoning with pain medications is common aspirin acetaminophen tylenol ibuprofen advil and naproxen aleve can all cause severe symptoms in dogs including vomiting blood diarrhea and abdominal pain specifically aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis acetaminophen can cause liver disease ibuprofen can cause kidney disease and naproxen can cause ulcers in the stomach which can perforate treatment depends on the symptoms contact your veterinarian or the aspca animal poison control center in case of possible exposure feeding habits and obesity feeding table scraps to a dog is generally not recommended at least in excess dogs get ample correct nutrition from their natural normal diet otherwise just as in humans their diet must consist of the appropriate mix of nutrients carbohydrates and proteins with the appropriate mix to provide all of the minerals and vitamins that they need a human diet is not ideal for a dog the concept of a balanced diet for a carnivore like a dog is not the same as in an omnivorous human wild and feral dogs can usually get all the nutrients needed from a diet of whole prey and raw meat in addition the scraps often consist of fat rather than meat protein which is no better for dogs than it is for humans while not all human delicacies are acutely toxic to dogs see above many have the same chronically unfortunate results as they do for humans lastly many people overfeed their dogs by giving them all the table scraps that the dogs will eat which is usually all the table scraps they are fed which is often too much food the result of too much food is obesity an increasingly common problem in dogs which can cause numerous health problems just as it does in humans although dogs are much less susceptible to the common cardiac and arterial consequences of obesity than humans are additionally the feeding of table scraps directly from the table as opposed to taking scraps after the meal and giving them in the dog s food dish as a treat can lead to trained begging behavior on the part of the dog or even encourage the dog to reach up and take food directly from the table another trained response these are normally seen as undesirable behavioral traits in a dog coprophagia many dogs have a fondness for eating feces some consume their own or other dogs feces others seem to prefer cat feces which due to the feline digestive system are high in protein and consumed by many animals in the wild and will raid a kitty litter box for treats this can be unsafe for the dog s health if the animal producing the feces has any diseases or parasites or has recently ingested drugs that might be poisonous for more information see coprophagia additional health information dogs are susceptible to various diseases similarly to humans they can have diabetes epilepsy cancer or arthritis other diseases are more specific to canines bloat and gastric torsion breeds with deep chests and narrow waists such as the bouvier des flandres or doberman pinscher for instance are susceptible to a syndrome of gastric torsion and bloat where the stomach twists on its supporting ligaments sealing off the exits and the contents begin to generate gas pressure which is not only terribly painful as can be imagined by anyone who has experienced even mild gas pains but kills large areas of stomach tissue fairly quickly resulting in a painful death within a very few hours a similar disease is seen in cattle and horses and a similar home remedy has sometimes been effective when a veterinarian is not at hand i e puncturing the stomach from outside with a sharp object to relieve the pressure obviously such a remedy must only be attempted as a last resort dogs who have experienced such an attack are very susceptible to another which is usually more severe and this is one case where the most medical intervention usually proves the best choice normally involving abdominal surgery to tack the dog s stomach down in several places to prevent recurrence vertigo elderly dogs are susceptible to an unusual form of intense vertigo the cause of which is unknown the affected dog is unable to stand up and remains sprawled on the floor the eyes displaying intense nystagmus for typically a few days while terrifying in appearance owners often fearing that the dog has had a fatal stroke which is actually uncommon in dogs the vertigo passes within a few days and by the end of a week the dog is staggering around upright and within another week there is no evidence that anything at all had happened the only risk of the disease is that the dog is unable to eat or drink in that condition and must receive supportive therapy of intravenous fluids and nutrition a light sedative is usually also administered as the dog naturally seems terrified during the experience tobacco smoke the passive smoking article has information on the effects of second hand smoke on dogs other health related

was never made origins steven spielberg came up with the idea for night skies in the late 1970s when columbia pictures wanted a sequel to close encounters of the third kind spielberg had no interest in a sequel but also didn t want columbia make a sequel without him as universal pictures had done with jaws spielberg came up with a treatment to a close encounters follow up instead of a sequel initially entitled watch the skies which had also been a working title for close encounters spielberg based the story on a tale of alien encounters he had heard from noted ufologist j allen hynek while doing paranormal research for close encounters back in 1955 a kentucky family claimed that they had been terrorized and held captive by aliens who surrounded their farm and dissected their farm animals in spielberg s original treatment for watch the skies eleven malicious extra terrestrial scientists try to communicate with chickens cows and other cattle in an attempt to discover which of earth s animal species are sentient before turning their unwelcome attentions on the human family fueling hollywood rumors about the film nasa announced that spielberg paid to reserve cargo space for the 1980 inaugural space shuttle flight in order to film the earth and its moon from orbit for the film s opening sequence spielberg stated that he would produce watch the skies but not direct it as he was under contract to direct his next film for universal john sayles and rick baker spielberg at first wanted lawrence kasdan to flesh out his watch the skies treatment into a full fledged script

with aliens but sayles says his inspiration was the 1939 western film drums along the mohawk sayles even named one of the aliens scar a character who was said to be a real badass after a comanche indian badguy in the john wayne film the searchers spielberg suggested that either tobe hooper best known for directing and co writing the texas chainsaw massacre or ron cobb a cartoonist and special

directorial experience the film was scheduled to begin shooting after spielberg returned from filming raiders of the lost ark spielberg chose make up and special effects master rick baker who at the time was also working on john landis s an american werewolf in london to design and create the alien creatures rick baker built a working prototype of the lead alien that cost 70 000 and thrilled

featured five aliens cut down from the original eleven including the aforementioned scar squirt and buddy who was kind and befriended the human family s autistic son sayles s script opened with scar who was described in the script as having a beak like mouth and eyes like a grasshopper s killing farm animals by touching them with a long bony finger which gave off an eerie light and ended with buddy marooned on earth by his mean spirited peers cowering under the shadow of a hawk origin of e t while baker worked on the aliens spielberg was having second thoughts about night skies i might have taken leave of my senses throughout production of raiders i was in between killing nazis and blowing up flying wings and having harrison ford in all this high serialized adventure i was sitting there in the middle of tunisia scratching my head and saying i ve got to get back to the tranquillity or at least the spirituality of close encounters while on the set of raiders spielberg read the script to night skies to melissa mathison who was there to see her then boyfriend and future husband harrison ford and she cried after hearing it because the idea of an alien creature who was benevolent tender emotional and sweet and the idea of the creature s striking up a relationship with a child who came from a broken home was very affecting when spielberg came back from tunisia and

 id=165062 title newcomen steam engine nonfiltered 201 processed 199 dbindex 1500205 the atmospheric engine invented by thomas newcomen today referred to as a newcomen steam engine or simply newcomen engine was the first practical device to harness the power of steam to produce mechanical work newcomen engines were used throughout england and europe principally to pump water out of mines starting in the early 18th century james watt s later engine was an improved version although watt is far more famous today newcomen rightly deserves the first credit for the widespread introduction of steam power precursors prior to newcomen a number of small steam engines of various sorts had been built but most were essentially novelties around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small fountains first filling a container with water then pressurizing it with steam to shoot it out however these devices could not be scaled up as the ability to produce large containers for high pressures simply didn t exist in 1662 edward somerset second marquess of worcester published a book containing several ideas he had been working on one was a steam powered fountain which used vacuum instead of pressure in his design two containers would alternately be filled with steam and then allowed to condense to produce a vacuum that would suck up more water from a well a new charge of steam then pushed the water out as in earlier designs by running the two containers back to back the fountain could be made somewhat continuous savery s miner s friend in 1698 thomas savery introduced a steam powered pump he called the miner s friend essentially identical to somerset s design and almost certainly a direct copy applied to pumping out mines the water was no longer driven from the cylinder by a new steam charge but simply allowed to flow out of a valve once the steam condensed and the cylinder was filled the process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow so savery later added a small water inlet or spray to quickly cool the steam like other vacuum based pumping systems savery s had the problem that it could not lift water more than 32 feet at a time for deeper mines some sort of mechanical pump needed to be used one that lifted the water directly instead of sucking it up such pumps were common already but required a vertical reciprocating action that savery s system did not provide savery s invention acted as a kind of siphon and had no moving parts consequently it cannot really be regarded as the first steam engine since it could not transmit its power to any external device there were evidently high hopes for the miner s friend which led parliament to extend the life of the patent by 21 years so that the 1699 patent would not expire until 1733 unfortunately savery s device proved much less successful than had been hoped several other experimenters attempted to provide mechanical work from existing engine designs one of the most interesting was that of denis papin who succeeded in raising a piston by boiling water in a cylinder and showed that the vacuum created when the steam condensed could lift a heavy weight however this was merely a laboratory toy he failed to develop it into a practical steam pump introduction and spread thomas newcomen developed the principles of savery and papin into the beam engine in which a large wooden beam rocked up and down upon a central fulcrum instead of siphoning the water up as in savery s engine a cylinder pump at the bottom of the mine was operated by the motion of the beam the cylinder was filled with steam from a boiler usually below it this was condensed using a jet of water the resultant vacuum pulled down one end of the beam thus operating the pump attached to the other it is probable that the first newcomen engine was in cornwall but its location is uncertain this was followed by two in the black country of which the more famous was that erected at the conygree coalworks near dudley but this was probably preceded by one built a mile and a half east of wolverhampton both these were used by newcomen and his partner john calley to pump out water filled coal mines a working replica can today be seen at the nearby black country living museum which stands on another part of what was lord dudley s conygree park soon orders from wet mines all over england were coming in and some have suggested that word of his achievement was spread through his baptist connections the newcomen engine was hardly used in north america due to disputes regarding its possible interference with the production of traditionally made beaver pelts since savery s patent had not yet run out newcomen operated under that patent since its term was much longer than any newcomen could have easily obtained during the latter years of its currency the patent belonged to an unincorporated company the proprietors of the invention for raising water by fire although its first use was in coal mining areas newcomen s engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native west country such as the tin mines of cornwall by the time of his death newcomen and others had installed over a hundred of his engines not only in the west country and the midlands but also in north wales near newcastle and in cumbria technical details newcomen s engine consisted of a boiler a in which the steam was generated this was usually a haystack boiler situated directly below the cylinder it produced low pressure steam all that the current state of boiler technology could cope with steam at this pressure would be unable to move a piston of any size one side of the beam was attached by a chain to the pump at the base of the mine and the chain at the other side suspended a piston within a cylinder b the cylinder was open at the top end above the piston p to the atmosphere the piston had a bevelled edge around which hemp rope kept in place by metal weights acted as a primitive seal the rope was kept wet so that it would expand against the sides when the valve v was opened the steam was admitted into the cylinder after this valve was closed valve v was opened to allow cold water from the tank c into the cylinder thus condensing the steam and reducing the pressure under the piston the atmospheric pressure above then pushed the piston down in the power stroke this raised the working parts of the pump but their weight immediately returned the beam to its original position steam was then readmitted driving the remains of the condensate out through a one way snifter valve as the process started all over again early versions used manual operation of the valves to work but the action was slow enough that this was not a serious concern later versions used controls attached to the rocking beam to open and close the valves automatically when the beam reached certain positions the common story is that in 1713 a boy named humphrey potter whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended made the engine self acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches known as the potter cord this device was simplified by 1718 according to an illustration by henry beighton who showed suspended from the beam a rod called the plugtree which worked the valves by means of tappets by 1725 the engine was in common use in collieries and it held its place without material change for about three quarters of a century towards the close of its career the atmospheric engine was much improved in its mechanical details by john smeaton who built many large engines of this type about the year 1770 while its main use was pumping water out of mines the newcomen engine was also used in some places to pump water to drive machinery for example refilling the upper pool at coalbrookdale so that there was more water available to drive the blast furnaces also at madeley wood or bedlam furnaces and others of the same period the 1750s richard arkwright for example even attempted to use a newcomen engine to pump water to power a waterwheel successor the main problem with the newcomen design was that it was very expensive to operate after the cylinder was cooled to create the vacuum the cylinder walls were cold enough to condense some of the steam as it was sprayed in this meant that a considerable amount of fuel was being used just to heat the cylinder back to the point where the steam would start to fill it again as the heat losses were related to the surfaces while useful work related to the volume increases in the size of the engine increased efficiency newcomen engines became larger in time however efficiency did not matter very much within the context of a colliery where coal was freely available attempts were made to drive machinery by newcomen engines but these were unsuccessful as the single power stroke produced a very jerky motion newcomen s engine was only replaced when james watt improved it to avoid this problem watt had been asked to repair a model of a newcomen engine by glasgow university a model exaggerated the scale problem of the newcomen engine in the watt steam engine condensation took place in a separate container attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe when a valve on the pipe was opened the vacuum in the condensor would in turn evacuate that part of the cylinder below the piston this eliminated the cooling of the main cylinder and dramatically reduced fuel use it also enabled the development of a reciprocating engine with upwards and downwards power strokes more suited to transmitting power to a wheel watt s design introduced in 1769 did not eliminate newcomen engines immediately watt s vigorous defence of his patents resulted in the desire to avoid royalty payments as far as possible the expiry of the patents led to a rush to install watt engines in the 1790s and newcomen engines were eclipsed even in collieries probably the last newcomen style engine to be used commercially and the last still remaining on its original site is at elsecar near barnsley in south yorkshire further reading l t c rolt and j s allen the steam engine of

 id=2070538 title dog society nonfiltered 212 processed 210 dbindex 1500216 dog society has traditionally been thought of as dog packs characterized by companionate hierarchy in which each individual has a rank and in which there is intense loyalty within the group dogs thrive in human society because their relationships with humans mimic their natural social patterns a dog supposedly always has a rank relative to other individuals in the group this is not true there are no ranks in a dog s mind the pack only exists to facilitate the hunting of large prey though new theories suggest the pack strategy instead maximizes reproductive success and has less to do with hunting an assertive dog may take the role of the mythical or theoretical alpha animal considering its human master to be subordinate some recent research however indicates that rather than a hierarchy dogs and wolves form a family group and individuals display assertiveness or passiveness rather than dominance and submission which are uncommon in wild wolves dominance and submission dogs like wolves establish a hierarchy through aggressive play and roughhousing along a continuum of dominance and submission when kept as pets dogs include humans in this hierarchy or social group it is important for successful socialization that puppies participate with their littermates in learning to relate to other dogs dogs learn to successfully relate to other dogs by keeping the peace rather than constantly fighting to reestablish this hierarchy dominance behavior dominant dogs generally take the initiative and are more active than less dominant dogs displays of dominance include standing above or over other dogs placing a paw on other dogs holding the tail and ears erect looking directly at other dogs circling and sniffing other dogs growling if the other dog moves and aggressive marking of territory with urine submissive displays mirror dominant displays and include adopting a posture that is lower than other dogs such as crouching rolling over on the back and exposing the abdomen lowering the tail even tucking it beneath the legs flattening of the ears averting the gaze nervously licking or swallowing dribbling of urine and freezing or fleeing when other dogs are encountered ideally the dominant submissive social structure of dogs avoids conflict and enforces social stability poorly socialized dogs who are inept at establishing dominance hierarchy may become involved in excess conflicts especially from a human viewpoint people who misunderstand dog behavior or who have inadvertently placed themselves in a disadvantageous position within the dominance submissive hierarchy can find themselves participants in similar conflicts with the animal s it is problematic to anthropomorphize the dominance submission behavior of a pet or to mistake it for characteristics more appropriately applied to humans it can be dangerous for a dog to be dominant relative to its master or mistress owners who inadvertently reward dominance or assertiveness by giving in to a dog s demands and preferences may cause the dog to feel that it is more important than its owner or than other dogs likewise submission in a dog is not necessarily an indication of a problem dog continuing to discipline a dog after it has adopted a submissive or appeasement posture is contrary to a goal of obedience behavior when isolated dogs value the companionship of the others in their pack and are sometimes distressed if they are separated from it typical reactions when a dog is separated from the pack are barking howling digging and chewing these activities may distress humans when they need to leave dogs alone for a period of time however this behavior called separation anxiety can be overcome with training or at least decreased to the point where it becomes manageable if young puppies are habituated to periods alone from an early age this can normally be prevented entirely some owners struggling to deal with this problem resort to debarking favorite activities dogs enjoy spending time with and interacting with other dogs roughhousing and chasing one another are favorite activities off leash dog parks can be good places for dogs to exercise and interact with other dogs when seeking relaxation dogs enjoy lying about with their companions favoring spots with a good view of their surroundings recent research dr david mech of the university of minnesota who has studied wolves in their natural habitat claims that new evidence about the behavior of wild wolf packs shows that the traditionally described hierarchy in wolf packs does not actually exist he no longer uses the word alpha because it falsely implies a hierarchical structure in which a wolf assumes a place in a linear hierarchy mech also states that dominance is rare in wild wolves instead of dominance and submission he uses the terms assertiveness and passiveness references see also dog communication pack

when first entering sparky s den bender s eyes are solid blue resembling those of a spice addict in the dune universe the robot devil actually performs an excerpt from la ronde des lutins the dance of the goblins by antonio bazzini the fiddle playing duel with the robot devil is a reference to the story depicted in the devil went down to georgia when leela says who would have thought that hell really exists and that it would be in new jersey she is perhaps alluding to the famed jersey devil while fry s response of actually is a continuation of the running joke that new jersey is an unpleasant place to live in the temple of robotology prior to bender s baptism there are two lines parodying the basic programming language on a banner above the altar 10 sin 20 goto hell the symbol of robotology that is welded onto bender s stomach is the symbol used in wiring schematics for a resistor the location of robot hell is under a ride called the inferno which can be slightly linked with the robot devil s ironic punishments and dante s divine comedy it also parallels the dean koontz novel hideaway in which a serial killer who believes himself to be a demon prince of hell performs satanic rituals under a ride in an abandoned amusement park goofs when bender picks the robot devil s pocket the robot devil disconnects bender s arm before throwing him down to the next level of

s hands are idle playthings trivia this episode along with its animatic version is one of four featured in the monster robot maniac fun collection reflecting its popularity with both fans and the

ride the inferno there is a heart on the wall with h s m b in the center a reference to homer simpson and marge bouvier in the simpsons when saying robot grace talking in binary bender uses the number

as i grew up and came to love this honest beautiful expression of truth i swore an oath that i would seek its extremes come what may because in the end i knew it was a curative a medicine an elixir of such potency it could give us all a glimpse of immortality there are a few experiences in life that enable us to lose all fear one of them is when we are caught in the embrace of a brief staining spit spewing shrieking strangling laugh that comes from the recognition of truth i could go on but why you are here because you get it know that you are at the front you are point men and women there is no battle though it is a march it cannot be stopped we now know that truth can be found in the pure laugh and as we tramp on howling and wetting ourselves others will join us until that day that great day when we finally make the mental hook up the eye opening deja vu that the laugh is indeed what separates us from the animal and then we will know that animals are garbage that should be ground into sausage or stunned with prods until they too get with it finally and start to laugh amen brother phil first church of pant stain almorado california june 25 2006 show format when hendrie has one of his guests on the opening segment is usually cordial and presents an unusual premise for discussion in the second segment a new outrageous element is usually brought in to the ongoing discussion and callers are introduced the callers are usually angry and outraged at what the guests are discussing and the guest usually responds in a caustic manner in the third segment a third and final surprise enters the conversation and often a hilarious crescendo pitch is reached that leaves callers exhausted and enraged and listeners laughing the caller and guest converse in downright bellicose tones which often becomes a surreal good cop bad cop routine as hendrie hangs up on his guest and apologizes to the caller typically two hours of the three hour show are devoted to character based comedy segments where the fake guests voiced by phil interact with real callers the remaining hour is devoted to phil s commentary on the topics of the day and to short comedy bits that could not occupy a full hour of the show sometimes two hours are used for commentary and shorter bits and only one hour of a fake guest is performed hendrie s other segments include how to read a news story coast to coast am with art bell a schtick on the real art bell phil s mailbag flashback requests bud dickman s radical nascar accidents phil explains the bullcrap with frodo the puppet and life imitates phil a segment where an outrageous stunt that had been invented on his program was later duplicated in real life phil is joined in the studio by bud dickman a slightly mentally retarded intern voiced in a relatively cartoonish kermit the frog like tone by hendrie according to the character s backstory his brain damage is the result of a motorcycle accident that sent him head first through an oak tree near ojai california bud often antagonizes phil into beating him senseless or to the point of tears by making bad jokes or ratting him out to programming director david g hall a fictionalized version voiced by hendrie when the host says something that could be metaphor for sex or genitalia hendrie has admitted on several occasions that this sidekick is something of a safety net bailing him out of long rants or unsuccessful bits at the same time bud has become one of the shows most beloved characters and there was a fan uproar when phil fired him briefly in 2004 bud has also been killed at least once by phil only to reappear moments later saying he got better often during some segments of the show hendrie provides his own personal opinions and commentary on his life career and various news stories the number of these segments devoted to political commentary increased following the september 11 2001 attacks as he has become a staunch supporter of president bush s war on terrorism a longtime democrat and staunchly liberal on a number of issues hendrie has strongly voiced opposition to the democratic party as of late accusing it of having lost touch with its core constituents and failing to adequately engage with a philosophy to win the war on terror beginning in january 2004 however the phil hendrie show decreased the number of serious segments in hendrie s own voice and returned to the commentary through satire which originally made him famous hendrie often promotes my friend s place a resource center for homeless youth based in hollywood california and donates all the proceeds from the sales of his best of cds to the center guests the show featured dozens of recurring fictional personalities some of the most popular ones include austin amarka austin amarka has made a lot of different incarnations on the phil hendrie show in one bit he was a construction worker specializing in cabinets and can lights and also works on cars he s an advocate of a conservation program called hunt and release as opposed to the catch and release program from the sport of fishing whereby a hunter just wounds the deer then takes it to a veternarian to have the bullet or arrow removed and then releases it back into the wild he also enjoys the extreme sport of putting on a bulletproof vest then donning a deer suit and running around in the forest so hunters can shoot at him a brusque arch conservative amarka runs don t mess with texas a fanatical pro death penalty organization which holds fiestas and chili cookoffs when convicted murderers are executed in the lone star state he was even once a death row inmate who tried feigning mental retardation to escape the chair austin is a white nationalist but lately has been having second thoughts about the superiority of caucasians since a black gentleman beat him so badly at a scrabble tournament austin now owns a service station in lancaster california austin is one of phil s more versatile and diverse characters making his precise identity difficult to describe as it often changes depending on the bit bob bakian news helicopter reporter who reports on insane reactions from people after hearing celebrity gossip bob reported that michael powell has resigned from the fcc so he can go on food stamps like other black people and he was reprimanded along with phil by david g hall for doing the same material twice david g hall also instructs bud dickman to blast bakian out of the sky for doing schtick such as when korean scientists successfully cloned a dog and bakian kept mispronouncing the scientist s names as yoo suk wang swinging wang and wang who suk aside from his schtick bakian seems to show an alarming tendency toward good old fashioned ineptitude he once mistook part of the downtown los angeles area as being flooded when in actuality his helicopter was simply over the pacific ocean blaine baxter noted poet laureate beset by a wandering eye that typically wonks out whenever he reads a famous poem his segments usually end in disaster when the audience or phil get tired of his continual distractions art bell real life weekend host of syndicated on air and internet radio program coast to coast am hendrie lampoons him i have news out of nasa and it s shocking from time to time hendrie opens the segment with a parody of ross mitchell coast to coasts opening announcer repeating

abba a song bell himself often uses art often advertises outlandish products from a fictitious sponsor peenman enterprises but first this from peenman enterprises selling things such as the earth handle the ass wallet the pubic hair straightener and the human waste chili maker a frequent guest of art s is general johnson jameson who reports from his underground bunker deep within the saskatchewan crust general jameson is often accompanied by his hunchback drug addicted assistant igor and all of his bits inevitably end with a crude and tasteless fart joke general jameson and art bell seem to be friends outside of the show having driven down to area 51 and waking up having been probed and sodomized by aliens once general jameson was inspired by art bell s real guests richard c hoagland and major ed dames the real art bell has stated on several occasions that he is not offended by these parodies and in fact is a huge fan of phil hendrie s show ted bell egomaniacal owner of the upscale steakhouse ted s of beverly hills one of phil s sponsors with the motto we want to put our meat in your mouth the word mouth is now censored in light of recent fcc crackdowns leading the song to sound even more vulgar frequently interjects with i m ted bell when speaking to the callers has a chronic phobia of the disabled and is president of the beverly hills automobile association inventor of the cocktail called a ted simply the very common rum and coke his meals are outrageously overpriced but bell often brags that he was the first to put tinfoil on a baked potato and that he invented the baked potato tree a wooden device in the shape of a tree on which baked potatoes are skewered so that patrons may select one and once in possesion can unzip it and pull it out hot for their dinner ted drives a mclaren slr and often reminds callers that it cost him 400 000 ted stated that when he was 17 years old his father put a cashier s check in his account for 20 million now at the age of 40 he is proud to say that he is worth 25 million in 2005 phil hendrie pulled a google bomb type prank by creating tedsofbeverlyhills com which lists a fake address and phone number causing

thanksgiving is a crock and we should have slaughtered the indians right off the bat when we came logan is also told to drink some blue sparkling liquid glass cleaner by his grandpa don berman don is a proud member of the award winning channel 19 news team often brought on the show to talk about current news events his latest investigative stories and other media related topics don s reports are frequently controversial such as a special on teenage drinking and driving that instead of simply discouraging the illegal act advised minors on how to safely make their way home without police interference other members of the channel 19 news team include reporter donna decruz and meteorologist goldie showers clara bingham school administrator one of pastor rennick s q v flock in the joyful

for more than a few seconds after which he wheezes uncontrollably his rambling and pointless recipes always call for excessive amounts of fat and sugar phil pledged to depose of chef carl as a sponsor after the presentation of his deep fried kid recipe chef carl sounds remarkably like roland schwinn r c collins one of hendrie s most popular characters collins is a young pubescent cadet attending bradley military academy in altadena california r c has a very long story arc that has stretched for many years the character actually died of a rare kidney disease in 1998 but was found alive and well at a kfi radio in the park event several weeks later at the time r c was a satan worshipping goth since he claimed that jesus didn t give him a good kidney he was a popular student who played high school basketball while wearing a top hat a black cape with r c embroidered in red letters and while carrying a staff r c has had his share of medical problems while living with his mother who was always drunk and passed out and not a part of his home life he lost a testicle as a result of the loss of his kidney thus suffering for years afterward with phantom nut he now has a prosthetic left testicle r c had a short stint on air working for phil doing the force report with bud dickman before the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace the pair mostly got in trouble and took

often began to talk about the bowler ben laughlin when people mentioned the name of osama bin laden comb over boy a send up of talk show host tom leykis with whom hendrie has a long standing rivalry both hosts chide each other on their respective programs seemingly without any goodwill he recently killed himself due to the fact that he sucks and is ugly however comb over boy has made a comeback as of late doug dannger newspaper columnist of the fictitious orange county courier since coming out as a homosexual he frequently proclaims his status as a gay man and a gay journalist although the proclamation is rarely relevant to the discussion at hand in many of his confrontations doug claims he will go eyeball to eyeball with the caller even if one of the two of them has to use a shoebox to level off he declares as the number one movie of the millennium the shaggy d a a disney flick from the 70s whenever someone disagrees with doug he insists it must be because of their homophobia among his many assertions doug believes that gay journalists himself in particular should be trusted with national secrets since they ve already proven they can keep a secret for a long period of time i m a gay man and a gay journalist because i was born that way joe dickhead and the professor joe dickhead and the professor do a sports show from high atop the las vegas strip where they make nfl picks but they are always doing something else while giving the picks like playing marco polo or getting a root canal their picks are always wrong and sometimes have nothing whatsoever to do with football previously these bits were performed every friday except on the wednesday before thanksgiving during the nfl season however as of last year joe and the professor s nfl picks have occurred less often bud dickman bud is a producer sidekick intern and call screener during the show the victim of a motorcycle accident sixteen years earlier in ojai california which caused him to have a steel plate inserted into his head bud is employed on the show to comply with the americans with disabilities act bud usually gets into trouble on the air and sometimes off the air as well on most occasions if phil may say something on air that might be remotely suggestive bud will typically notify phil s vice president of syndication david g hall who usually errs on bud s side bud is also the heir to millions of dollars on account of mini dickmann s candy that is popular in germany bud does not like black people because they scare him but bud thinks his black football player buddy lance is ok because he s a football player and his girlfriend a ups driver is black but bud thinks she s ok because she s beautiful phil often points out bud s contradictions when it comes to race but bud never seems to comprehend bud speaks cantonese when ordering chinese food and apparently clang means i m out in cantonese bud was named dave del weygan when phil was on in ventura phil has said on the air that bud is a crutch he leans on for comic relief during rant hours and when bud was briefly fired phil said to a voice he made up i gotta stand on my own two feet bud occasionally goes through the phone line and kills annoying guests especially c 93 program director darren brown perhaps bud dickman s finest moment came when phil fired him on the air phil explained that bud was too cartoonish and that he had bombed big time at a recent live taping of the show bud started crying and left the studio after calling phil a prick hendrie was deluged with emails demanding that he reinstate bud and eventually he got back on the show after vp of syndication david g hall interceded on his behalf me me like the phil hendrie show describing phil s show in seven words or less bobbie dooley

husband and is always described as the owner of a wildly successful landscaping business bobbie makes a trademark repeated mmmmmmmm hmmmmmmm noise when listening to the callers which almost always annoys them and is reminiscent of a former colleague of mr hendrie s her father was a circus clown and her mother a prostitute hendrie often does best of bobbie dooley shows during holiday periods mrs dooley calls the program frequently to espouse her upper class soccer mom viewpoints which are often little more than her husband steve s opinions who can be heard in the background coaching her bobbie and steve are obsessed with being young hip and with it which apparently accounts for the wild parties they throw for minors steve enjoys hanging out in the hot tub with his son and all his friends then jumping out to reveal that he has been naked from the waist down bobbie assures listeners it was hilarious when steve screamed the cobra is out of the cage bobbie enjoys her youngness as well and is known to teach girls how to commit sodomy so as to improve their sex life bobbie dooley is also on the committee and spokeswoman for the fall tacular winter tacular spring tacular and summer tacular fashion shows on occasion bobbie sings offkey songs on the show because she used to be a professional singer by the name of yvonne elleman who sang with lynyrd skynyrd and blue oyster clut before going solo to sing on the soundtrack for saturday night fever according to bobbie mr stigwood wanted a more ecclectic feel to the soundtrack and thought an image of a china woman would be

old oldest child seth seth has been accused of date rape by a girl bobbie calls a slut has been discovered messing around with another boy in his car and crashed into a bunch of disabled kids

excuse for his behavior is it s about saving lives which he will go about doing even as he perverts the concept of citizen s arrest beyond recognition and taking it completely out of context jay believes that the legal right to citizen s arrest gives him arrest privileges beyond even that of accredited law enforcement agencies when confronted by callers that he is a police wanna be jay merely states that he is not in accredited law enforcement because there are too much politics a cacophony of police scanners can be heard in the background whenever jay phones in the life saving duties of the citizen s auxiliary police include arbitrarily frisking teenage girls at shopping malls ostensibly to prevent shoplifting stopping white motorists to inspect their nostrils for methamphetamine as they are mountain trash making sure that men hanging around swimming pools aren t putting any inappropriate visual images in the spank bank and conducting mandatory gynecological exams on female motorists because distraction due to vaginal irritation might result in a car crash jay s shining moment of vigilanteism came when he prevented large men from lifting up a tricycle and trying to sniff the seat at a garage sale according to santos the garage sale yard sale is the pit of evil in america jay says that if after questioning a citizen he can find no evidence of wrong doing then it s a

nervous laugh of which he ll uncotrollably go into when talking about his perverted past this laugh of his has proven to be very effective as it ultimately freaks out the caller herb a convicted sex offender often calls from high risk situations such as carnivals or city parks and can often be heard talking to children in the background previously he was merely rich and deluded a la ted bell and

and unsuccessful attempt to stow away on his uncle s john porter s ship of the line franklin he signed on franklin at the age of 12 porter was appointed a midshipman on 1 january 1823 and 11 years later was commissioned a lieutenant from 1838 to 1840 he served as lighthouse inspector for the portion of the east coast between norfolk va and new york that duty was followed in 1840 with an assignment at the washington navy yard as ordnance officer during this assignment he became interested in the development of an explosive shell suitable for naval use after leaving washington porter spent the next decade superintending the outfitting of new steam ships for the navy commanding supply vessels and delivering mail and supplies to navy units abroad following retirement between 1855 and 1859 he was returned to active duty and took command of st mary s in that sloop of war he patrolled the pacific coasts of mexico and central america for two years protecting american interests in

confederate defenses along the river in november he took his ship to st louis for repairs and upon his return to the flotilla at cairo ill new era sported a new name essex in honor of the frigate essex which porter s father had commanded during the war of 1812 between january and august 1862 porter served gallantly up and down the mississippi river on 10 january essex and st louis engaged three confederate gunboats and forced them to retreat to the protection of southern shore batteries the two union gunboats repeated the feat three days later and succeeded in damaging their opponents only confederate shore batteries prevented the capture of the three steamers on 6 february essex joined the rest of foote s gunboat squadron in the attack on fort henry porter s ship second in line sustained heavy fire from shore batteries and received at least 15 direct hits about half an hour into the fray essex took a 32 pound shot through her bow shield it pierced her boilers releasing steam which severely scalded 28 men commander porter himself blinded and scalded continued to conn his ship until she was clear of the action though still severely hampered by his injuries porter directed the extensive repair and renovation of essex from his sick bed at the same time he also superintended the construction of two other warships the ironclads lafayette and choctaw porter completed the renovation of essex at st louis in july and rejoined the western flotilla at vicksburg miss later that month at dawn on the 22d porter took essex out to confront the confederate ironclad ram css arkansas which had recently left her refuge in the yazoo river to seek greater safety under the cover of vicksburg s shore batteries in company with the smaller converted riverboat queen of the west essex moved in toward the southern warship during the approach of the two union ships confederate shore batteries subjected them to a withering fire finally essex struck arkansas a jarring blow but at an oblique angle as a result she glanced off the southern ram and ran aground parallel to her adversary porter worked furiously to free his ship and after much difficulty managed to retire with queen of the west close behind thereafter since essex had sustained only minor damage porter kept her on station patrolling the lower mississippi river between vicksburg and baton rouge on 5 august his ship and sumter assisted union army troops in repelling a confederate land attack on baton rouge the following morning he headed north to vicksburg to confront arkansas once more he found his quarry on a bend in the river close to the shore in the ensuing bombardment porter used an incendiary shell which he himself had invented after about 20 minutes of shelling arkansas erupted into flames and soon blew up evidence suggests that the confederate crew had set their own ship afire to prevent her capture be that as it may porter s bold action played no small part in the ram s destruction moreover congress recognized the role played by porter and his ship in june 1864 when they belatedly awarded the essex crew 25 000 in prize money porter s last real action in the war occurred in september 1862 when essex conducted a bombardment of natchez miss and duelled the shore batteries at port hudson la later that month he returned to new orleans where new orders awaited him promoted to the rank of

southeastern europe it has a coast on the adriatic sea to the south and borders croatia to the west bosnia and herzegovina to the northwest serbia to the northeast and albania to the southeast its de facto capital and largest city is podgorica while cetinje is designated as prijestonica the old royal capital or seat of the throne independent from the late middle ages until 1918 the country was later a part of various incarnations of yugoslavia and the state union of serbia and montenegro based on the results of a referendum held on may 21 2006 montenegro declared independence on june 3 2006 on june 28 montenegro became the 192nd member state of the united nations name montenegro s native name crna gora was first mentioned in a charter of st nicholas monastery vranjina issued by the serbian king milutin in 1296 and translates literally to black mountain a reference to the dark forests that once covered the slopes of the dinaric alps as seen from the coast the country s name in most western european languages including english reflects an adoption of the venetian language term also meaning black mountain which probably dates back to the era of venetian hegemony over the area in the middle ages other languages particularly nearby ones use their own direct translation of the term e g albanian bulgarian cherna gora romanian greek and turkish black mountain from further afield include and pinyin h ish n the iso alpha 2 code for montenegro is me and the alpha 3 code is mne history the slav tribes mixed with illyrians avars and romans formed the semi independent dukedom of duklja by the tenth century in 1077 pope gregory vii recognized duklja as an independent state acknowledging its king mihailo michael of the vojislavljevi dynasty founded by nobleman stefan vojislav as king of duklja the kingdom however paid tribute to the byzantine empire later to the bulgarian empire it gave birth to the later medieval kingdom of the serbian grand prince stefan nemanja who originated from duklja the principality of zeta which more closely corresponds to the early modern state of montenegro asserted itself towards 1360 the house of bal i 1360s 1421 and the house of crnojevi 1421 1499 ruled zeta and though the ottoman empire controlled the lands to the south and east from the 15th century it never fully conquered zeta in 1516 the secular prince ura crnojevi abdicated in favour of the archbishop vavil who then made montenegro into a theocratic state under the rule of the prince bishop known as vladika of cetinje a position held from 1697 by the petrovi njego family of the ri ani clan petar petrovi njego perhaps the most influential vladika reigned in the first half of the 19th century in 1851 danilo ii petrovi njego became vladika but in 1852 he married left the priesthood assumed the title of prince and transformed his land into a secular principality in 1910 prince nikola i became king of montenegro two years later in october 1912 king nikola declared war on the ottoman empire precipitating the two balkan wars the montenegrin army attacked the ottoman fortress city of skutari and forced the empire to gather a large army in neighbouring macedonia this ottoman army was then attacked by the forces of greece serbia and bulgaria which entered the war by pre arrangement the result was a military disaster for the ottomans who were thrown back to an area north of constantinople montenegro emerged from the balkan wars doubled in size receiving half of the former ottoman territory known as the sanjak of novi pazar but without skutari the country s major prize in the war the london conference awarded skutari to an independent albania during world war i montenegro was part of the allies in the course of the war montenegro was occupied by austro hungarian troops feldmarschalleutnant viktor weber von webenau became military governor of montenegro on february 26 1916 in 1918 the podgorica assembly voted for uniting montenegro with the kingdom of serbia however pro independence montenegrins revolted on christmas day 1919 against serbia the revolt was finally suppressed in 1924 from 1945 to 1992 montenegro separated from serbia and became a constituent republic in its own right of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia it was during this time that the present capital podgorica was renamed titograd after josip broz tito dictator of yugoslavia over the next half century montenegro remained one of six constituent republics of yugoslavia union with serbia 1992 2006 after the dissolution of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia in 1992 montenegro agreed on a federation with serbia first as the federal republic of yugoslavia then as a looser state union of serbia and montenegro that broke up as soon as a deadline for holding an independence referendum expired in the referendum on remaining in yugoslavia in 1992 95 96 of the votes were cast for remaining in the federation with serbia although the turnout was at 66 because of a boycott by the muslim albanian and catholic minorities as well as of pro independence montenegrins the opposition claimed that poll was organized under undemocratic conditions during war time in the former yugoslavia with widespread propaganda from the state controlled media in favour of a pro federation vote there is no impartial report on the fairness of the referendum as the 1992 referendum was totally unmonitored unlike the 2006 vote which was monitored by the european union in 1996 milo ukanovi s government de facto severed ties between montenegro and serbia which was then still under milo evi montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the deutsche mark as its currency it has since adopted the euro though it is not formally part of the eurozone subsequent governments of montenegro carried out pro independence policies and political tensions with serbia simmered despite political changes in belgrade despite its pro independence leanings targets in montenegro were repeatedly bombed by nato forces during operation allied force in 1999 in 2002 serbia and montenegro came to a new agreement regarding continued cooperation in 2003 the yugoslav federation was replaced in favour of a looser state union named serbia and montenegro and a possible referendum on montenegrin independence was postponed for a minimum of three years independence the status of the union between montenegro and serbia was decided by a referendum on montenegrin independence on may 21 2006 a total of 419 240 votes were cast representing 86 5 of the total electorate 230 661 votes or 55 5 were for independence and 185 002 votes or 44 5 were against the 45 659 difference narrowly surpassed the 55 threshold needed to validate the referendum under rules set by the european union according to the electoral commission the 55 threshold was passed by only 2 300 votes serbia the member states of the european union and the permanent members of the united nations security council have all recognized montenegro s independence doing so removed all remaining obstacles from montenegro s path towards becoming the world s newest sovereign state the 2006 referendum was monitored by 5 international observer missions headed by an osce odihr monitoring team and around 3 000 observers in total including domestic observers from cemi and other organizations the osce odihr rom joined efforts with the observers of the osce parliamentary assembly osce pa the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace the congress of

communism montenegro experienced a rapid period of urbanization and industrialization an industrial sector based on electricity generation steel aluminum coal mining forestry and wood processing textiles and tobacco manufacture was built up with trade overseas shipping and particularly tourism increasingly important by the late 1980s the loss of previously guaranteed markets and suppliers after the break up of yugoslavia left the montenegrin industrial sector reeling as production was suspended and the privatization program begun in 1989 was interrupted the disintegration of the yugoslav market and the imposition of the un sanctions in may 1992 were the causes of the greatest economic and financial crisis since world war ii during 1993 two thirds of the montenegrin population lived below the poverty line while frequent interruptions in relief supplies caused the health and environmental protection to drop below the minimum of international standards the financial losses under the adverse effects of the un sanctions on the overall economy of montenegro are estimated to be approximately 6 39 billion this period also experienced the second highest hyperinflation in history 3 million percent in january 1994 the highest hyperinflation happened in hungary after the end of world war ii when inflation there hit 4 19 x 10 16 percent in 1997 milo ukanovi took control over the ruling democratic party of socialists of montenegro dps and began severing ties with milosevic serbia he blamed the policies of slobodan milo evi for the overall decline of the montenegrin economy as well as milo evi s systematic persecution of non serbs montenegro introduced the german mark as response to again growing inflation and insisted on taking more control over its economic fate this eventually resulted in creation of serbia and montenegro a loose union in which montenegro mostly took responsibility for its economic policies this was followed by implementation of faster and more efficient privatization passing of reform laws introduction of vat and usage of euro as montenegro s legal tender the government brought up the agenda demographics according to 2003 census

collected in 42 tank bon as of 2006 the title refers poetically to the mask of faces that actors wear while expressing emotions that are not their own the mask they wear their acting is as fragile as glass if the actors are distracted their mask will break and show on stage the actors true feelings story glass mask is a saga depicting the devotion of maya kitajima kitajima maya to the performing arts as a professional stage actress and her competition with her skilled rival ayumi himekawa himekawa ayumi they are both pursuing the degree of acting proficiency and career success required to play the lead role of the legendary stage play the crimson goddess maya has dreamed of becoming an actress all her life but no one in her family believes she can do it and she is determined to prove them wrong as the story unfolds it encompasses the tangled human relationships of many characters including maya s mentor chigusa tsukikage tsukikage chigusa who discovered maya s tremendous talent for acting during her search for a successor capable of performing the role of the crimson goddess and masumi hayami hayami masumi the young president of a large production company who often interacts

maya calls him for his trademark gift of purple roses though there is an age difference of eleven years masumi falls in love with maya and gives her encouragement in subtle ways while many chapters have been published in hana to yume subsequent to the collected manga volumes miuchi is for reasons of her own redrawing chapters and initiating changes to the storyline the most recently published volume features a cell phone something which did not exist at the beginning of the series run and may be evidence of a desire by the manga artist to modernize certain aspects of the series certain elements of the prior storyline in the hana to yume chapters have also led to fan speculation that miuchi may have decided to change the storyline entirely by disregarding these chapters and rewriting them to suit the new direction she wishes to take the series in certain stylistic elements of glass mask are quite similar to those of sports manga and anime such as attack no 1 and ace o nerae such as the heroine s complete and total devotion to her craft a struggle to persevere in the face of crippling self doubts and lack of support from family and peers and training programs that are often quite grueling and brutal during one rehearsal tsukikage is unhappy with maya for not reaching the emotional peak needed to perform the scene and slaps her repeatedly until she gets it right the

 id=1371969 title united new jersey railroad and canal company nonfiltered 269 processed 267 dbindex 1500274 the united new jersey railroad and canal company was part of the pennsylvania railroad system in new jersey including their main line to new york city now amtrak s northeast corridor prior to 1872 its main lines were the camden and amboy rail road and transportation company c a the first railroad in new jersey and one of the first in the u s and the new jersey rail road and transportation company njrr the first railroad across the new jersey palisades the c a first purchased and operated the oldest surviving operable steam locomotive in the world today the john bull the united company also included the delaware and raritan canal an early foe and then friend of the c a history the first railroad charter in the united states was issued february 6 1815 to the new jersey railroad company on behalf of john stevens and others based on turnpike charters it allowed the company to build between new brunswick and trenton and became a model for railroad charters in the future that company never did anything but the idea evolved into the later njrr chartered in 1832 camden and amboy 1830 1834 the camden and amboy rail road and transportation company was chartered on february 4 1830 on the same day as the delaware and raritan canal company after the two competing companies had come to a compromise the c a and d r had the same goals to connect the delaware river serving philadelphia pennsylvania with the raritan river for access to new york city the d r was built to the west of the original c a leaving the delaware at trenton and running roughly northeast to new brunswick on the raritan while the original c a ran from camden across the delaware from philadelphia to south amboy on raritan bay the c a was organized on april 28 in camden and surveys began june 16 as railroads were a relatively new invention rails and locomotives were bought from england construction began december 4 1830 at bordentown on the delaware river construction efforts were largely carried out by horse drawn carriages the john bull arrived at bordentown on september 4 1831 and was first tested november 12 the first section from stewarts point wharf near bordentown north to hightstown was opened to the public on october 1 1832 being operated by horse at first service between philadelphia and new york city was provided by steamboats and a stagecoach trip was used between hightstown and south amboy the trip cost 3 and ran in 9 5 hours 1 2 hours faster than other routes the rest of the line to south amboy opened december 17 allowing for the elimination of the stagecoach transfer but the delaware soon froze on december 27 requiring stagecoach operation south of bordentown freight service began january 24 1833 regular locomotive operation by the john bull began september 9 of that year in fall 1833 the line was extended south to delanco and the full line to camden was completed december 19 1834 jersey city to trenton 1832 1839 on march 7 1832 the new jersey rail road and transportation company njrr was chartered as a parallel line to the c a beginning at jersey city closer to new york city but was limited to building south to new brunswick due to the c a s influence the c a would build the part from new brunswick south to spotswood changed to trenton in 1836 due to the alliance with the philadelphia and trenton railroad in november 1832 the njrr acquired control of the newark turnpike which paralleled the planned alignment east of newark to avoid problems caused by competition the stock of the essex and middlesex turnpike running south from newark to new brunswick was bought april 6 1833 the majority of the line was built directly along the turnpike the alignment as originally planned crossed the passaic river on the centre street bridge then curved south along park place and broad street directly into the turnpike a branch would have run from the west end of the bridge south along the river and then southwest to the main line at the south end of broad street but this became the main line and the original plan along broad street was never built on november 24 1833 the njrr bought out the proprietors of the bridges over the rivers passaic and hackensack who had monopolies on their bridges over the passaic and hackensack rivers on the newark turnpike in order to eliminate their threat around 1852 the njrr acquired the newark plank road and ferry company incorporated 1849 to keep the passaic and hackensack monopoly regular njrr service began september 15 1834 between newark and jersey city using a temporary track over bergen hill an extension to elizabeth opened december 21 1835 using the turnpike from the south end of broad street service to rahway began january 1 1836 again along the turnpike from a point south of elizabeth locomotives were only used south of newark until january 11 though some horse power operations continued east of newark the line opened to east of new brunswick july 11 with an omnibus transfer the rest of the way the turnpike was used north of iselin on september 8 1836 the njrr acquired a majority of stock of the new brunswick bridge company to avoid its local monopoly over crossings of the raritan river the double deck bridge over the raritan opened october 31 1837 with a road beneath the railroad taking the njrr to new brunswick the new brunswick bridge company was authorized to charge a toll on the lower level on may 7 1838 the old 1795 albany street bridge was removed in 1849 but was later rebuilt the bergen hill cut the last part of the jersey city new brunswick line to be finished opened january 22 1838 replacing the old temporary alignment over the hill and ending the use of horse power on march 15 1837 a supplement to the c a s charter was passed allowing the branch to new brunswick connecting with the new jersey rail road to branch off of the c a at bordentown rather than spotswood to pass through trenton for a connection with the trenton delaware bridge and the philadelphia and trenton railroad portions could be built next to the delaware and raritan canal or along the new brunswick and trenton turnpike construction on the branch began in september 1837 between bordentown and trenton where it was built on the east bank of the d r canal the initial branch opened april 4 1838 construction on the extension to new brunswick began june of that year opening january 1 1839 the branch continued northeast from trenton on the east bank of the canal splitting at kingston and running cross country to millstone junction southwest of new brunswick that same day the njrr was completed from new brunswick to millstone junction despite forming one third of the route the njrr only got one sixth of the earnings from the joint operation which ran between philadelphia and new york city in 5 5 hours down from 6 hours 50 minutes via south amboy further connections and realignments 1839 1867 by 1841 a connection opened between the philadelphia and trenton railroad and the c a s trenton branch including a bridge over the delaware and raritan canal in trenton this allowed for through philadelphia jersey city operation but most traffic continued to run via camden due to the distance between the p t s kensington terminal and center city philadelphia on may 31 1854 the c a decided to realign the trenton branch between trenton and deans pond due to bad soil conditions on the current line on the bank of the d r canal a plank road would be built to connect to princeton which the new alignment would bypass a tunnel under the canal in trenton was completed in march 1860 for the line between the philadelphia and trenton railroad and the new alignment construction on the new line began october 1862 the clinton street station on the new line at trenton opened april 20 1863 replacing the old state street station the first train ran through the new tunnel on october 5 1863 and the new line opened november 23 cutting new york city trenton time to 2 5 hours the second track on the new line opened september 1864 but the old line remained for southbound freight the princeton branch opened may 29 1865 on which date passenger trains stopped running over the old line the old line was removed between trenton and princeton in july a portion in trenton was kept to serve businesses the part from princeton north to kingston was removed in september on the start of freight operations on the princeton branch and the part north of kingston which was not next to the canal was kept to serve the rocky hill railroad other companies use of the line to jersey city closely tied to the early njrr was the paterson and hudson river railroad later the main line of the erie railroad the p hr agreed in june 1833 to build to the west side of the new jersey palisades at marion junction where it would use the njrr s bergen hill cut the rest of the way to the hudson river the p hr opened november 29 1833 prior to the opening of any part of the njrr in the meantime using a stagecoach along the newark turnpike to reach the river a trackage rights agreement was made october 10 1834 and p hr operation to jersey city began october 20 the long dock tunnel opened april 15 1861 giving the p hr by then part of the erie its own route to the hudson river also involved with the njrr was the morris and essex railroad later the delaware lackawanna and western railroad s main line on october 21 1836 the njrr agreed to carry m e traffic between newark and jersey city beginning november 19 a new alignment meeting the njrr in harrison opened august 5 1854 on october 14 1863 the m e began using the long dock tunnel the central railroad of new jersey also used the njrr to reach jersey city from elizabeth until its own line opened on august 1 1864 monopoly and competition the c a often used legislative and legal means to protect its monopoly on new york city philadelphia travel the monopoly was finally broken on may 1 1876 with the completion of the national railway over seven years after the legal monopoly expired on january 19 1831 new jersey passed a supplement to the d r canal s charter allowing them to build a railroad alongside their canal however this was soon mooted by the union between the c a and d r on february 15 1831 the c a and d h were combined as the joint companies with all important decisions made by a joint board and all stock was consolidated an act passed february 4 1831 gave the c a monopoly powers for nine years against railroads built within three miles of the c a in exchange for the state receiving 1000 shares of stock the protection act passed march 2 1832 expanded this to give the joint companies a monopoly on new york city philadelphia traffic across new jersey on march 16 1854 this exclusive right was extended to january 1 1869 as long as the c a helped other railroads including the west jersey railroad and double tracked its main line in summer 1835 robert f stockton bought control of the trenton delaware bridge and philadelphia and trenton railroad to end its competition

1 1862 a competing line began operating via the raritan and delaware bay railroad and camden and atlantic railroad running steamboats between new york city and port monmouth at the north end of the r db this common threat caused the c a and njrr to work more closely signing an agreement october 1 the newark and new york railroad later part of the central railroad of new jersey opened in july 1869 giving major competition to the njrr from newark east consolidation and prr lease 1867 on february 1 1867 after much back and forth bickering the c a and njrr were informally joined as the united new

better known as the brothers quay or quay brothers they are influential stop motion animators they reside and work in england where they moved in the late 1960s after studying illustration in philadelphia to study at the royal college of art where they made their first short films which no longer exist after the only print was irreparably damaged they spent some time in the netherlands in the 1970s and then returned to england where they teamed up with another royal college student keith griffiths who produced all of their films the trio formed koninck studios in 1980 which is currently based in southwark south london the quays works 1979 present show a wide range of often esoteric influences starting with the polish animators walerian borowczyk and jan lenica and continuing with the writers franz kafka bruno schulz robert walser and michel de ghelderode puppeteers wladyslaw starewicz and richard teschner and composers leo janá ek zden k li ka and leszek jankowski the last of whom has created many original scores for their work czech animator jan vankmajer for whom they named one of their films the cabinet of jan vankmajer is also frequently cited as a major influence but they actually discovered his work relatively late in 1983 by which time their characteristic style and preoccupations had been fully formed most of their films feature dolls often partially disassembled in a dark moody atmosphere perhaps their best known work is street of crocodiles based on the short story of the same name by the polish author and artist bruno schulz

is influenced by the quays although they worked on peter gabriel s seminal video sledgehammer 1986 as animators this was directed by stephen r johnson and the quays were unhappy with their contribution believing it to be too imitative of vankmajer s work than truly distinctive in its own right their work also includes decors for the theatre and opera productions of director richard

 id=3153858 title winfixer nonfiltered 300 processed 297 dbindex 1500305 winfixer winantivirus errorsafe systemdoctor and drivecleaner are identical or similar computer programs available for microsoft windows that claim to repair computer system problems they are forcibly installed on the victim s computer by the sysprotect vector they display false information with regards to a user s computer thereby confusing said user into believing their pc is infected with viruses spyware and or other forms of malware the adverts pop up a display with notifications to convince the user that something may be amiss with the computer or run a fake diagnostic the program repeatedly prompts the user to purchase a licensed copy of the program due to these problems winfixer and its sister applications are reputed to be spyware or malware indeed their misleading popups and forced downloads mirror the marketing strategies of many spyware programs some computers infected with this program exhibit sluggish performance symantec s report on winfixer mcafee s report on winfixer kaspersky also has it listed as mal ware sophos report a possible fix winfixer s claim winfixer 2005 is a useful utility to scan and fix any system registry and hard drive errors it ensures system stability and performance frees wasted hard drive space and recovers damaged word excel music and video files in truth winfixer does none of these things how it infects there are several ways in which winfixer can infect a computer users using internet explorer are most susceptible although users of other browsers such as firefox and opera can also be infected but are more resistant to the program one infection method that is browser independent involves the trojan trojan emcodec e a fake codec that exists in numerous versions typical infection the infection usually occurs during a visit to a distributing web site not necessarily winfixer com using internet explorer a message appears in a dialog box asking the user if they want to install winfixer when the user chooses any of the options or tries to close this dialog by clicking ok or cancel or by clicking the corner x it will trigger a pop up window and winfixer will download and install itself regardless of the user s wishes because this is a dialog box related to the internet explorer application it does not appear in the windows task manager list ctrl alt del however the user may be able to avoid installing the program either by using the alt f4 command or by disconnecting from the internet before closing the dialogue box winfixer is able to stop a computer s optical drive from working trial offer of winfixer a free trial offer of this program is sometimes found in pop ups if the trial version is downloaded and installed it locates a couple of alleged trojans and viruses but does nothing else to obtain a quarantine or removal winfixer requires the purchase of the program some reviewers believe the alleged unwanted bugs to be bogus only serving to induce the owner to buy the program if the winfixer program is found it usually will not go away without the use of anti virus software it tends to keep popping up in windows on the user s screen until removed with said software winfixer application once installed winfixer frequently launches pop ups and prompts the user to follow its directions because of the intricate way in which the program installs itself into the host computer including making dozens of registry edits successful removal may take a fairly long time if done manually when running it can be found in the task manager and stopped but before long it will re install and start up again firefox popup the mozilla firefox browser is less vulnerable than internet explorer yet not totally immune to initial infection by winfixer however once installed winfixer is known to exploit the sessionsaver extension for the firefox browser the program causes popups on every startup asking the user to download winfixer by adding lines containing the word winfixer to the prefs js file non windows systems it is difficult if not impossible for winfixer to install itself on a non windows system the most obvious cue is its scan of microsoft windows which demonstrates that the program is fraudulent because it runs the program like it is running a windows program in addition it includes obviously fake browser windows that do not even match those of most non windows systems pop up windows when a user browses the internet and receives an alert message it will trigger a set of 3 pop up windows regardless of the software type winfixer errorsafe or winantivirus will alert the user about possible ongoing attacks in this case winfixer prompts the user to use their software to scan the computer for possible worms viruses and trojans etc if the user clicks the x or cancel it will launch another pop up telling the user that they have not completed the scan if the user selects any of the options winfixer will install itself if the user disconnects from the internet before clicking an option they will get the dialog boxes but nothing will happen avoid infection if the initial dialog box is shown disconnecting from the internet before closing it may prevent the download prompt and therefore the risk of infection shutting down all browser windows using windows task manager also seems to be effective do not simply close the browser windows using the x as it will often still auto download use task manager instead this may not be as effective for users of a windows os older than 2000 however 2000 and xp users can close iexplore exe or firefox exe without the install taking place switching to a browser other than internet explorer may reduce vulnerability to this and other online trojan threats most malware is targeted at internet explorer due to its widespread use and thus is written to take advantage of any flaws and loopholes in its programming blocking the site www winfixer com in your firewall will prevent the typical infecting download however there may be other means by which the program installs itself removing winfixer there are several other products to be found on the web that claim to have the ability to stop and uninstall winfixer many of these solutions are winfixer clones winfixer will prompt the user to purchase a licensed copy of the winfixer software making this purchase may solve the problems caused by the application without removing it there is no proof that the program works even after purchasing the license some users report that purchasing and installing the winfixer program causes additional serious operating problems symantec has published procedures for removing winfixer manually this is a manual process involving registry editing as of january 2006 the better known antivirus and antispyware software packages do not detect or remove winfixer infections automatically mcafee s winfixer information indicates that winfixer may be classified as legitimate software however mcafee s vundo information may aid a user in removing winfixer this removal process makes use of sysinternals s process

solutions inc the server secure errorsafe com is operated by errorsafe inc at 1878 hutson street belize city bz miscellaneous and technical information technical winfixer is closely related to aurora network s nail exe hijacker spyware program in worst case scenarios it may embed itself in internet explorer and become part of the program thus being nearly impossible to remove the program is also closely related to the vundo and virtumonde viruses note the database entry for the virtumonde trojan and winfixer itself are down as of late february 2006 however a great number of forum members on on line technical support forums and blogs believe that winfixer is associated with the vundo trojan it puts dllrunning in the registry hkey_local_machine software microsoft windows currentversion run and a randomly named dll file into c windows system32 for example ptnuscsd dll program name it is speculated that the name winfixer is derived from the old microsoft windows abbreviation win joined with the word fixer thus implying it is windows fixer because of the name association with the operating system a hypothetical situation could occur in which a user may possibly think that they are downloading a windows related program when in fact they are not identical programs other programs have appeared on the internet under different names with advertisements similar to winfixer s including errorsafe systemdoctor sysprotect privacyprotector drivecleaner winantispyware ecsecured and winantivirus the popups give the same warning as winfixer and also refuse to be ignored in

worcester massachusetts on june 9 1953 these tornadoes are among the deadliest in united states history and were caused by the same storm system that moved east across the nation the tornadoes are also related together in the public mind because for a brief period it was debated in the u s congress whether recent atomic bomb testing in the upper atmosphere had caused the tornadoes congressman james e van zandt r penn was among several members of congress who expressed their belief that bomb testing created the tornadoes they demanded a response from the government meteorologists quickly dispelled such an assertion and congressman van zandt later retracted his statement the flint worcester tornadoes were the most infamous storms produced by a larger outbreak of severe weather that began in iowa and wisconsin before moving across the great lakes states and then into new york and new england other f3 and f4 see fujita scale tornadoes struck other locations in massachusetts michigan new hampshire and ohio the flint tornado an f5 tornado hit flint michigan on june 8 1953 the tornado moved east northeast 2 miles north of flushing michigan and devastated the north side of flint and beecher the tornado first descended about 8 30 p m on a humid evening near a drive in movie theater that was flickering to life at twilight time motorists in the drive in began to flee in panic creating many auto accidents on nearby roads the tornado dissipated near lapeer michigan nearly every home was destroyed on both sides of coldwater road multiple deaths were reported in 20 families it is as of this writing the last single tornado to kill more than 100 people one hundred and sixteen were killed making it the ninth deadliest tornado in u s history it is also one of only three f5 tornadoes ever to hit in michigan another f5 would hit in hudsonville on april 3 1956 the worcester tornado the storm system that created the flint tornado moved east as radar was relatively primitive in 1953 this led to inadequate severe weather predictions the weather bureau in buffalo new york merely predicted thunderstorms and said that a tornado may occur the weather bureau in boston feared that the word tornado would strike panic in the public and refrained from using it without warning an f4 tornado struck central massachusetts in the late afternoon hours on june 9 1953 the tornado descended over the quabbin reservoir in petersham massachusetts at 4 25 p m witnessed by boaters on the reservoir it then slammed into the rural towns of barre and rutland followed by suburban holden before killing 60 in heavily populated northern worcester ironically residents of massachusetts were coming home at that hour of the day to pick up their evening newspapers with front page headlines of the tornado that had struck in michigan the previous day some wondered if it was the exact same tornado that was now impacting them two visitors from pittsburgh died when a tree crushed their car shrewsbury and westborough each suffered numerous fatalities the tornado did its final destruction at the fayville post office on route 9 in southborough and dissipated nearby over the sudbury reservoir eighty four minutes after it formed ninety four people in total were killed this tornado was on the ground for nearly an hour and a half in that period it traveled 46 miles reached one mile in width and injured 1 300 people barre suffered the first 2 fatalities the tornado then renewed its vigor in rutland center with 2 more deaths the funnel widened to 1 2 mile in holden where 9 were killed the worst hit areas being winthrop oaks and brentwood at 5 08 p m the tornado entered worcester and grew to a width of one mile damage was phenomenal in worcester which is the second largest city in massachusetts and in some areas equalled the worst damage seen in the history of u s tornadoes hard hit areas included assumption college where a priest and two nuns among the faculty were killed the burncoat hill and great brook valley neighborhoods were leveled with houses simply vanishing and debris swept clean from their original sites a bus was picked up rolled over several times and thrown against an apartment building resulting in the deaths of two passengers the brookside home farm a city operated dairy facility and laundry sustained total damage with six men and most of its 80 holstein cows killed wrecked houses and bodies were blown into lake quinsigamond according to john o toole s book see references at least one victim definitely perished when suction from the tornado ripped open his chest due to his lungs rapidly expanding airborne particles of debris were strewn eastward reaching an observatory 35 mi 56 km away and even out over massachusetts bay and the atlantic ocean this storm maintained a 1 mile width throughout much of shrewsbury and was still doing maximum damage when it moved through downtown westborough where it began curving towards the northeast in its final leg coincidentally around the time it ended in southborough at 5 45 p m a tornado warning was issued although by then it was too late a separate weaker tornado also descended roughly about the same time in the nearby communities of franklin and wrentham in massachusetts injuring about 17 persons another tornado did minor damage in rockingham county new hampshire the worcester tornado was a milestone in many regards not only because of its enormous size and unusual geographic location but also due to the fact it was the nation s costliest tornado in raw dollars at the time and its 1300 injuries still stands as the 4th worst in u s history in terms of fatalities it is the last tornado as of december 2006 to kill 90 or more people making it the 20th worst on record the severity of this epic storm remained in dispute for a long period within the meteorological community observations classified this tornado as f4 in many communities but damage was inflicted consistent with an f5 tornado in some locales as a result of this debate the national weather service convened a panel of weather experts during the spring of 2005 to study the latest evidence on the wind strength of the worcester tornado the panel considered whether or not to raise the designation of the storm to f5 but finally decided to keep the official rating at f4 during the summer of 2005 the reasoning for this was that many of the destroyed homes were of recent postwar construction making them less able to withstand high winds than older homes 1953 tornado season in perspective even though the 1953 tornado season only saw 422 tornadoes which is half the nationwide average the year saw some of the deadliest tornadoes which included the waco tornado that hit on may 11 how did a

 id=2152 title all quiet on the western front nonfiltered 333 processed 330 dbindex 1500339 for the film see all quiet on the western front film all quiet on the western front is a novel by erich maria remarque a german veteran of world war i about the horrors of that war and also the deep detachment from german civilian life felt by many men returning from the front the book was first published in german as im westen nichts neues in january 1929 it sold 2 5 million copies in twenty five languages in its first eighteen months in print in 1930 the book was turned into an oscar winning movie of the same name directed by lewis milestone it is often considered the best war book ever written title and translation the 1929 english translation by a w wheen gives the title as all quiet on the western front the literal translation is in fact nothing new in the west with west being the war front which was in fact a routine dispatch used by the german army this title in german adds to the terrible irony of the actual situation in english the phrase would be unclear whereas all quiet does sound like the english used for such matters brian murdoch s 1994 translation renders the phrase as there was nothing new to report on the western front within the narrative explaining his retention of the original book title he says although it does not match the german exactly there is a different kind of irony in the literal version wheen s title has justly become part of the english language and is retained here with gratitude separately the phrase all quiet on the western front later became popular slang for a lack of action in reference to the phony war in world war ii s western front plot summary the story follows the experiences of paul bäumer a soldier whose teacher inspires him to join the german army shortly after the start of the war he arrives on the western front with his friends tjaden müller kropp and a number of other characters and meets stanislaus katczinsky known as kat the older kat soon becomes paul s mentor and teaches him about the realities of war paul and kat swiftly become almost brothers bonded by the hardships of the war paul and his friends have to endure day after day of non stop bombardment eventually it all becomes clear to him war is entirely pointless all his friends say that they are fighting the war for a few national leaders whom they have never met and most likely never will they are the only people that can gain anything from this war not paul and his friends the book focuses not on heroic stories of bravery as do so many other war stories but rather gives a realistic view of the hell in which the soldiers found themselves the monotony the constant artillery fire the struggle to find food and the overarching role of chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers all are described in detail remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead emotionally depleted and hardened we are not youth any longer we don t want to take the world by storm we are fleeing from ourselves from our life we were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world and we had to shoot it to pieces paul receives a period of leave from the army and returns home temporarily he finds it difficult to understand people at home anymore while all the soldiers at the front wish for nothing more than peace knowing that they are losing the war civilians back home talk about marching on paris he is also indifferent to the significance of any of the battles battles have no names rather one after another they offer a chance for him to be killed battle seems to be waged only to gain pitifully small pieces of land he returns to his school where his teacher is still encouraging young men to enlist asked to what the war is like he tells them the truth and is shouted out of the classroom main characters paul bäumer paul bäumer is the narrator he is convinced to enlist in the german army for wwi by his long time teacher kantorek who promises that paul will have a sense of satisfaction having done something with himself he s 18 years old when he goes to war erich remarque uses paul bäumer to magnify some of the experiences he viewed himself as a ww i veteran he is kind hearted and always willing to lend a hand his deeds include giving his remaining cigarettes to russian prisoners and replacing the new recruits saw blade bayonets with shovels catching a goose to cook with kat in an intimate lean to visiting his dying mother with whom he has little relationship stabbing a french soldier in a shell hole and spending the night with the dead body along with others of his group he teaches the basics of war to the new recruits but in their excitement they do everything wrong in the film adaptations he was shown killed whilst reaching for a butterfly film or bird television movie paul is also used to describe the highly heightened sense of war and the remorse when killing the french soldier mentioned above he goes through the man s pockets learns about his life and family and briefly dedicates himself to their welfare the day on which paul is finally killed was otherwise militarily uneventful with the german army dispatches merely noting im westen nichts neues which as noted above translates literally to nothing new in the west this brings home that paul s death being only one among millions is nothing special albert kropp perhaps paul s closest friend kropp was in his class at school and is described as the smartest of the group paul mentions that in the middle of battle kropp mutters physics problems to himself kropp is wounded near the novel s conclusion and he has an amputation but since he was supposed to go home soon after paul leaves him it can be assumed that he is the only main character of the story to survive the war it is also suggested that kropp committed suicide after leaving paul as he had threatened to do if his leg was amputated which it was tjaden a skinny locksmith of paul s age and the biggest eater of the company tjaden did not volunteer for the war labeled as a piss a bed tjaden received unfair treatment from corporal himmelstoss for urinating in his sleep this system of re education involved hunting up another bedwetter who was quartered in the same bunk as tjaden the man on top would urinate at night and the fellow below would be switched from bottom the next night so that he could retaliate he was a very greedy young man who always found time to eat a good hearty meal leer a close friend to paul albert and the others leer was in their graduating class and was the first to have sexual intercourse he is the most sexually suggestive of all the characters in the story leer dies after being shot shortly before the conclusion of the novel after he bleeds to death paul can only remark of leer what use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician at school müller the most pragmatic of the group he is most noted for grilling his comrades with questions about what they re going to do after the war he is the one most trying to hold onto their past he is also the inheritor of kemmerich s boots for which he fervently begs whilst kemmerich is dying showing how the war turns a man from an individual into a heap of supplies which they might as well make use of the boots are later passed on to paul after muller s agonizing death haie westus haie is described as being tall and strong and paul identifies him as being slightly older than he and a peat digger by profession haie also has a good sense of humor he receives a wound in the back during a battle large enough for paul to see his lung when he breathes and he dies soon after stanislaus katczinsky also known as kat of an older age than paul baumer and his younger comrades katczinsky worked as a cobbler in civilian life as an elderly figure kat serves as a leadership figure for paul and his friends as well as a literary model showcasing the differences between the younger and older soldiers the latter whom paul describes as being connected to their former life whereas he and the men his age have their parents schooling and a few a girl when he is killed it is as though a great hero has died kat is also well known for his ability to scrounge nearly any necessary item above all food examples of this are provided throughout the book for instance one night paul and his company of men are quartered in a factory without rations nor comfortable bedding katczinsky leaves for a short while returning with straw to put over the wire bedding later to cure the hunger of some of his men kat retrieves bread a bag of horse flesh a lump of fat a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food he was wounded in the end of the story just before paul himself is killed paul carries him back to camp on his back only to discover when he arrives at the medics that a shell fragment pierced kat in the head during the journey and that he had died he is thus the last of paul s close friends to die in battle for it can be assumed that albert kropp lived above and it is his death that finally demoralizes paul to point that he does not care if he dies or not as he says that he can face the rest of his life without fear that the coming years can take nothing from me they can take nothing more only a few lines of text later paul is dead and he is described as having a look of relief on his face at the moment he passed away minor characters kantorek kantorek served as schoolmaster to paul and his friends including haie westhus tjaden leer and muller acting in a way that cost nothing kantorek is a proponent of the war and convinces baumer and the rest of his class to join the war effort out of twenty enlistees this includes one joseph behm the first of the class to fall ironically behm was the only fellow that did not want to fall in line also ironic kantorek is later called up as a territorial only to be grilled by one of the same students he convinced to enlist he was tortured by mittelstaedt who copied him to perfection mittelstaedt would imitate his snobbiness inadequate kantorek quite inadequate territorial kantorek do you call those buttons polished look at boettcher now there s a model for you to learn from territorial kantorek we have the good fortune to live in a great age we must embrace ourselves and triumph over hardship bertink lieutenant bertink often referred to as the company commander is the leader of paul s company his men have a great respect for him he is shown to carry a great fondness for his men he lets them eat the extra rations for men that died while the chef argues that they may only eat their share and is shown as being shocked when so few of his men survive an engagement bertink kills a flamethrower team that would have killed all of the protagonists but is killed by a bullet that richochets and hits and kills leer as well himmelstoss easily stirring the hatred of the reader himmelstoss is a power hungry corporal with a special dislike of paul and his friends taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of soldiers inferior in rank baumer and his friends mercilessly whip himmelstoss the night before they board trains to go to the front after himmelstoss later joins them on the front he is a coward who hides and claims that he is wounded because he has a scratch on his face paul beats him and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge he joins and leads the charge he carries haie westhus s body to paul after he is wounded later he asks for forgiveness from his old students he was to become the new staff cook he brings two packets of sugar for paul and one pound of butter for tjaden to prove his alliance detering he was a farmer who loved his farms he went mad when he saw a cherry blossom which reminded him of home too much and urged him to leave he was found and set before a field tribunal but is never heard of again he was especially fond of horses and was angered at those who used horses in the war it is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war josef hamacher hamacher is a patient at the catholic hospital where paul and albert kropp are staying he has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital he also has a shooting license certifing him as sporadically not responsible for his actions though all evidence points to his being quite sane franz kemmerich a lifelong friend of baumer and his comrades kemmerich is wounded at the beginning of the book later he had his foot amputated and afterwards died of an infection in his wounds he was in possession of some yellow knee high boots salvaged from a british aircraft pilot these are later referred to as kemmerich s boots and change hands as paul and his comrades are killed major themes there are many central themes in the book among them is that war is total nonsense for example none of the characters has ever seen a frenchman before the war much less have reason to kill them but that is now what they are forced to do some of the soldiers ponder how the war was started why it was declared and whom it benefits nobody has any answers there are also other themes that include comradeship friendship the humanity of the enemy the hypocrisy of authority figures loss of hope for the future animal instincts or how war reduces men to animals and many others such as loss of innocence the horror of war the main theme of all quiet on the western front is the brutality of war the archetypical war novel romanticizes war and extolls the heroes of the story however this book shows a vivid realistic and hellish portrait of war world war i saw the development of many new destructive innovations such as poison gas machine guns airplanes and tanks all of which made killing easier and even more impersonal the novel shows these weapons being used for butchery on a grand scale for instance battles lasting for four months paul describes the horrors of war throughout the book the trenches and fortifications are shelled continually poison gas blankets the battlefield snipers shoot at anyone with their head above ground paul even sees the horrible results from the trench mortars which literally blows men out of their clothes finally the american troops come and the german lines disintegrate vivid descriptions are presented throughout the book combined with gritty little details that could only come from personal experience paul explains at one point why a shovel with sharpened edges is so much better in close up combat than a bayonet nothing short of being there could show the sheer numbers of dead and wounded every day in the war effect on soldiers the physical and mental hardships pressed on soldiers during times of war can be absolutely astounding and in trench warfare these hardships were ever present bullets bombs mortars and disease easily destroy men by the tens of thousands while those who live to fight another day are subject to dealing with the mental anguish of the violent deaths of their comrades and the separation from civilian life tying into one of the central themes of the book remarque says at the beginning this book is neither an accusation nor a confession and least of all an adventure for death is not an adventure for those who stand face to face with it it will simply try to tell of a generation of men who even though they may have escaped the shells were destroyed by the war the book also emphasises that the war was worst for the lost generation those who went straight from school or college into the trenches as the narrator had done the older men still have firm ties to their earlier lives they have property wives children jobs and interest and these bonds are all so strong that the war can t break them but for us twenty year olds there are only our parents and for some of us a girlfriend that isn t much because at our age parental influence is at its weakest and the girls haven t really taken over yet chapter 2 we are like children who have been abandoned and we are as experienced as old men we are coarse and superficial i think we are lost chapter 6 nature the landscape on the front is barren but when paul goes on leave he sees nature nature represents escape it is beautiful and pure when traveling by train paul describes the beautiful mountains and plains of germany he wonders why this nature is being destroyed on the front he wants to preserve this beauty not destroy it also when he sees the french countryside he sees it is not different from the german countryside why should he destroy this either a disturbing incident involving a group of army horses terribly wounded in a bombardment and screaming with pain demonstrates the war s violation of innocent nature the author uses nature as a tool to change the tone of his writing to a more reflective and peaceful one in contrast to the rest of the book to temporarily escape from the horrors of war paul and his friends swim across a canal late at night for a relaxing evening with several french women who live on the other side also after a particularly violent battle paul observes birds flitting tranquilly about the shell torn fields and sees two butterflies miles from any vegetation perching on the teeth of a skull he notes that he has seen birds successfully raise their young in the midst of the trenches this highlights the human absurdity of the war and also hints at nature s reassuring capacity to go on about its business despite the surrounding turmoil animal instinct in many parts of this book through paul bäumer erich remarque expresses the human spirit transition into a more beastial nature it is apparent that erich remarque believes that the nature of war is so barbaric that human nature must be lowered to match the level of barbaric war there are many examples of paul bäumer reverting to animal instincts one such time is when he finds himself stuck in a shell hole surrounded by enemy soldiers he realizes that if any of the enemy were to join him in the hole it would mean instant death for him unless he could act without thinking and stab instantly he waits in the hole hoping that it would not happen as time goes by a frenchman jumps into the shell hole paul stabs the man instinctively only realizing afterwards that he has killed another human being later the barbarity of war leaves his spirit and he experiences guilt then remorse and only returns to rationality when he is able to leave the hole and the body within it presence of death constantly throughout the book the soldiers are followed by the frightful presence of death every time that they go to battle they pass by their own graves something that would send chills down any average person s back relations to other books romeo and juliet he buries his face and his limbs in her she is his only friend his brother his mother new won life he would now be a heap of mangled flesh that has thrown us to the ground and saved us there would not be one man alive 54 55 this can refer to the famer s soliloquy in romeo and juliet the earth that s nature s mother is her tomb what is her buring grave that is her womb act iv scene iii v 9 10 soldiers fall to the ground for protection this can be viewed as being reborn just similarly to a mother s womb protecting her helpless child continuing the story s loss of innocence theme a soldier can also drop to the ground after being shot or otherwise killed thus making the earth his tomb as bodies and dirt pile up on his corpse homer s odyssey in all quiet hope is presented as a major key to surviving the horrors of war homer s epic describes an occasion upon which odysseus returned home and received a bag he was instructed not to open it but during the night one of his crew members did so thus discovering that hope was the sole remaining item contained within remarque also portrayed hope as dangerous because it allows one to believe for better or worse that all will somehow turn out well in the end regardless of how improbable or impossible such a notion seems film tv and theatrical adaptations film in 1930 an american film of the novel was made directed by lewis milestone the screenplay was by maxwell anderson george abbott del andrews c

 id=4681924 title helian bobo nonfiltered 353 processed 350 dbindex 1500359 helian bobo 381 425 né liu bobo courtesy name qujie formally emperor wulie of xia was the founding emperor of the chinese xiongnu state xia he is generally considered to be an extremely cruel ruler one who betrayed every benefactor that he had and whose thirst for killing was excessive even for the turbulent times that he was in he built an impressive capital for his state at tongwan in modern yulin shaanxi that remained difficult to siege even hundreds of years later during the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period confusingly the book of wei refers to him as helian qugai based on a derogatory term that emperor taiwu of northern wei used to refer to him early life liu bobo was born in 381 when his father liu weichen was an important xiongnu chief and a vassal of former qin it is not known whether his mother lady fu was liu weichen s wife or concubine he was one of liu weichen s younger sons after former qin collapsed in light of various rebellions after its emperor fu ji n s defeat at the battle of fei river in 383 liu weichen took control of what is now part of inner mongolia south of the yellow river and extreme northern shaanxi and while he nominally submitted to both later qin and western yan as a vassal he was actually a powerful independent ruler however in 391 he sent his son liu zhilidi to attack northern wei s prince tuoba gui and tuoba gui not only defeated liu zhilidi but crossed the yellow river to attack liu weichen s capital yueba in modern ordos inner mongolia capturing it and forcing liu weichen and liu zhilidi to flee the next day liu weichen was killed by his subordinates and liu zhilidi was captured tuoba gui seized liu weichen s territory and people and slaughtered his clan however liu bobo escaped and fled to the xuegan tribe whose chief tai xifu refused to turn him over despite northern wei demands instead tai delivered liu bobo to the xianbei tribal chief mo yigan the duke of gaoping a later qin vassal and mo yigan not only gave liu bobo refuge but also married one of his daughters to liu bobo liu bobo from that point on became highly dependent on his father in law meanwhile in 393 tuoba gui because of tai xifu s refusal to deliver liu bobo to him attacked tai and slaughtered his people although tai himself escaped and fled to later qin little is known about liu bobo s life during the following years in 402 tuoba gui s brother tuoba zun the prince of changshan attacked mo s homebase of gaoping in modern guyuan ningxia and mo was forced to flee to later qin abandoning his own people who were scattered about although later later qin recaptured gaoping and gave that city back to mo sometime before 407 liu bobo who had become known for being handsome ability to speak well alertness and intelligence came to the attention of later qin s emperor yao xing yao xing was so impressed by liu bobo s abilities when he met liu bobo that he wanted to make him a major general to defend against northern wei yao xing s brother yao yong however spoke against it believing liu bobo to be untrustworthy stating liu bobo is arrogant toward his superiors and elders he is cruel to his subordinates and associates he is also greedy treacherous lacking in love and inattentive to friendships he changes his attitude quickly and abandons things quickly if you overly trust and favor this type of person he will surely create a disaster yao xing initially at yao yong s counsel did not give liu bobo a commission but eventually was so seduced by his talent that he made him a general and the duke of wuyuan giving him the responsibility of defending shuofang in modern ordos as well in 407 after suffering a number of losses against northern wei yao xing decided to make peace with northern wei upon hearing this liu bobo became angry because his father had been killed by northern wei and he planned rebellion he therefore forcibly seized the horses that yujiulü shelun the khan of rouran had recently offered to yao xing as a tribute and then made a surprise attack on his father in law mo yigan capturing gaoping and killing mo seizing his troops he then declared himself a descendant of yu the great the founder of xia dynasty and named his state xia he claimed the title heavenly prince tian wang early reign despite liu bobo s stated hatred for northern wei however he concentrated his efforts on undermining later qin continually harassing later qin s northern territories and draining later qin s resources he therefore did not settle in a capital city rather he roved about with his mobile cavalry constantly looking for later qin cities to pillage also in 407 liu bobo sought marriage with a daughter of the southern liang prince tufa rutan but tufa rutan refused in anger liu bobo launched a punitive raid against southern liang but then retreated tufa rutan gave chase and believing that he greatly outpowered liu bobo was careless in his military actions liu bobo led him into a canyon and then blocked the exit with ice and wagons and then ambushed him and the defeat was such that it was said that 60 to 70 of southern liang s famed officials and generals died in the battle tufa rutan barely escaped capture in 408 yao xing sent his general qi nan to launch a major attack on liu bobo liu bobo initially withdraw to let qi believe that he feared qi and liu bobo made a surprise counter attack and captured qi subsequently much of later qin s northern territories fell into xia hands in 409 yao xing himself launched an attack on liu bobo but when he reached ercheng in modern yan an shaanxi he was nearly trapped by liu bobo and escaped only after major casualties this defeat forced yao xing to cancel a mission commanded by his general yao qiang to try to save southern yan from being destroyed by jin without later qin aid southern yan fell in 410 for the next several years xia and later qin forces battled constantly often inconclusively but with the wars becoming much more costly to later qin than xia with southern liang and western qin no longer being willing to be later qin vassals as a result in 412 when western qin s prince qifu gangui was assassinated by his nephew qifu gongfu liu bobo considered attacking western qin despite its status as an ally but at the counsel of his advisor wang maide did not do so by 413 liu bobo finally resolved to build a capital one that he wanted to make absolutely impenetrable he commissioned his cruel general chigan ali as the chief architect of the capital which he named tongwan in modern yulin shaanxi because as he stated he wanted to unite china and be the lord of 10 000 states tong means unite while wan means 10 000 chigan ordered that the soil used in constructing the wall be steamed so that it would be hardened and difficult to attack and he often tested the walls during its construction if an iron wedge were able to insert even one inch deep into the wall the workmen who were in charge of that section of wall would be executed and their bodies would be stuffed into the wall further liu bobo himself ordered that when weapons and armors are made that some of the metalsmiths would be executed because his orders were for example that arrows should be shot at armors if the arrows could penetrate the armors the smiths who forged the armors would be executed and if the arrows could not penetrate the armors then the smiths who made the arrows would be executed as a result of this bloodshed however tongwan became a highly defensible city and the weapons and armors that he had were all of exceedingly high quality also in 413 liu bobo believed that his family name should be changed since his ancestors took on the liu family name from the han dynasty imperial house believing that one of their female ancestors was a han princess but liu bobo believed this to be improper he therefore changed his family name to helian intending it to mean that his might was so great that it would alas hè be connected lián to the heavens he also ordered the nobles to change their family name to tiefa intending it to mean that they were as strong as iron ti and be able to attack fá others in 414 helian bobo created his wife lady liang heavenly princess no further reference to the fate of his wife lady mo was recorded in history after he killed her father he created his son helian gui crown prince and created his other sons dukes in 415 helian bobo entered into an alliance with juqu mengxun the prince of northern liang in 416 with later qin now under the rule of yao xing s son yao hong under a major attack by the jin general liu yu helian bobo believed that later qin would fall to jin but that jin would not be easily able to hold later qin s capital region guanzhong he therefore intensified his own attacks on later qin as well and preparing to use the opportunity of later qin s destruction to seize more territory as later qin neared destruction helian bobo seized its western territory centering anding in modern pingliang gansu and then prepared for an eventual confrontation with jin forces which destroyed later qin in 417 and captured its capital chang an in winter 417 liu yu intent on wanting to seize the jin throne left chang an under the command of his 11 year old son liu yizhen and while he left several able generals to assist liu yizhen those generals soon conflicted with each other and were killing each other and eventually liu yizhen believing that the main assistant liu yu left him wang xiu to be about to rebel had wang executed meanwhile helian bobo sent his crown prince helian gui another son helian chang and wang maide to command armies south not initially engaging jin forces but isolating chang an from the rest of jin territory a task made easier when liu yizhen recalled jin forces near chang an all to chang an liu yu hearing this sent his general zhu lingshi to replace liu yizhen and recalled liu yizhen but as soon as liu yizhen and his troops left chang an they were intercepted and crushed by xia forces under helian gui liu yizhen barely escaped but the vast majority of the army was captured helian bobo stacked the skulls of the jin dead into a hill like structure meanwhile the people of chang an who were angry that liu yizhen s forces pillaged the city before leaving expelled zhu allowing helian bobo to enter chang an easily helian bobo then claimed the title of emperor late reign most of helian bobo s officials suggested that he move the capital to chang an but he believing that tongwan was in a better position to defend against northern wei refused and kept his capital at tongwan leaving helian gui in charge of chang an as viceroy the campaign against jin showcased helian bobo s abilities but at this time he also grew increasingly cruel he was described by traditional historians in this way he was arrogant and cruel treating the people like wild plants and mustard greens he often climbed up towers with bows and arrows and whenever he had a sudden thought of distrust dislike or anger at a person he would kill that person personally if any of his officials looked at him in a gazing manner he would gouge out their eyes anyone who laughed frivolously would have their lips sliced open with knives anyone who dared to offer a contrary opinion would first have his tongue cut out and then head cut off in 424 for reasons lost to history helian bobo decided to depose crown prince gui and create another son helian lun the duke of jiuquan crown prince upon hearing this news helian gui commanded his troops north from chang an and attacked helian lun their forces met at gaoping and helian gui defeated and killed helian lun however helian lun s brother helian chang then made a surprise attack on helian gui killing him and seizing his troops leading them back to tongwan helian bobo was pleased and created helian chang

 id=3352973 title pederasty in ancient greece nonfiltered 369 processed 365 dbindex 1500375 see also pederasty for situations other than ancient greece greek pederasty as idealized by the greeks from archaic times onward was a relationship and bond between an adolescent boy and an adult man outside of his immediate family and was constructed initially as an aristocratic moral and educational institution as such it was seen by the greeks as an essential element in their culture from the time of homer onwards the term derives from the combination of pais greek for boy with erast s greek for lover cf eros in a wider sense it referred to erotic love between adolescents and adult men the greeks considered it normal for any man to be drawn to the beauty of a boy just as much if not more than to that of a woman what they disagreed upon was whether and how to express that desire pederasty is closely associated with the customs of athletic and artistic nudity in the gymnasia delayed marriage for gentlemen symposia and seclusion of women it is also integral to greek military training and an important factor in the deployment of troops analogous relations between greek women and adolescent girls have been reported by plutarch xenophon and others see lesbian for details history possible beginnings the ancient greeks were the first to describe study systematize and establish pederasty as an institution the origin of that tradition has been variously explained one school of thought articulated by bernard sergent holds that the greek pederastic model evolved from far older indo european rites of passage which were grounded in a shamanic tradition with roots in the neolithic another explanation articulated by anglophone scholars such as william percy holds that pederasty was formalized in ancient crete around 630 bc as a means of population control together with delayed age of marriage for men of thirty years the earliest greek texts specifically the works attributed to the ionian poet homer do not overtly document formal pederastic practices a number of theories attempt to explain that lack a largely held view is the dorian hypothesis first established by k o müller in the 1800s according to this theory pederasty was brought in by the dorian warrior tribes who conquered greece around 1200 bc they settled most of the peloponnese along with the islands crete thera and rhodes this forced the ionian greeks towards asia minor but left important cities in attica and euboea another explanation is that the epic style excluded discussion of certain topics among them pederastic relations nevertheless homer s works hint at homoerotic relationships obliquely as in the mentions of the myth of zeus and ganymede in the iliad and the homeric hymn to aphrodite alternative forms pederasty was constructed in various ways in some areas such as boeotia the man and boy were formally joined together and lived as a couple in other areas such as elis boys were persuaded by means of gifts and in a few such as ionia such relations were forbidden altogether the spartans however were said to practice chaste pederasty where allowed a free man was usually entitled to fall in love with a boy proclaim it publicly and court him as long as the boy in question manifested the traits prerequisite to a pederastic relationship he had to be kalos handsome and agathos good brave just and modest the boy was expected to be circumspect and not let himself be easily won generally the role of the lover had many of the characteristics of that of legal guardian similar to the role of male relatives of the boy poets such as theognis and anacreon self identify as pederasts each thus presenting a persona embodying his own ideals for the tradition in the case of theognis pederasty is political and pedagogical the elite male s method of passing on his wisdom and loyalties to his beloved anacreon s values are erotic and dionysiac which is to say sensual and spiritual and no less ideal than those of theognis vase iconography of the period is consistent with this interpretation the gifts offered and the context of the palaestra speak of pedagogic values while the repeated inscriptions of kalos idealize the beauty and physical attraction of the er menos the beloved boy problematics foucault declared that pederasty was problematized in greek culture that it was the object of a special and especially intense moral preoccupation focusing on concern with the chastity moderation of the er menos the term used for the beloved youth foucault s conclusions however are now thought to hold true only of classical athenian texts while in archaic greece pederasty rather than being problematized was variously associated with the highest ideals the study of greek pederasty is complicated by the fact that the pederastic record has been subject to systematic destruction since antiquity of all the greek works dealing principally with love between people of the same sex none has survived suggesting to at least one historian that queer works were deliberately suppressed and destroyed rather than merely lost during the passage of time though in general only a small percentage of ancient literature has been preserved nonetheless there are some conspicuous exceptions to the general picture such as the paidik mousa of strato and the er tes of pseudo lucian evolution and extinction greek pederasty went through a series of changes over the millennium from its entry into the historical record and its final demise as an official institution in some areas such as athens the construction of the relationship seems to have gone from greater modesty in the early days to a freer physicality and lack of restraint in classical times followed by a return to a more spiritual form in the early fifth century its formal end resembled its beginning in that it came by official decree that of emperor justinian who also put an end to other institutions that sustained ancient culture such as plato s academy and the olympic games philosophical discourses main article philosophy of greek pederasty socrates plato aeschines socraticus and xenophon described the inspirational powers of love between men though decrying its physical expression upon the death of plato the presidency of the academy passed from lover to lover of the stoics chrysippus cleanthes and zeno fell in love with young men the topic of pederasty was the subject of extensive analysis some of the principal dilemmas discussed were which form should pederasty take chaste or erotic is pederasty right or wrong is pederasty better or worse than the love of women socrates as represented in plato s writings appears to have favored chaste pederastic relationships marked by a balance between desire and self control by setting aside the sexual consummation of the relationship socrates essentialized the friendship and love between the partners he pointedly criticized purely physical infatuations for example by mocking critias lust for euthydemus by comparing his behavior towards the boy to that of a piglet scratching itself against a rock that however did not prevent him from frequenting the boy brothels from which he bought and freed his future friend and student phaedo nor from describing his erotic intoxication upon glimpsing the beautiful charmides naked body beneath his open tunic socrates love of alcibiades which was more than reciprocated is held as an example of chaste pederasty plutarch and xenophon in their descriptions of spartan pederasty state that even though it is the beautiful boys who are sought above all others contrary to the cretan traditions nevertheless the pederastic couple remains chaste male relationships were represented in complex ways some honorable and others dishonorable but for the vast majority of ancient historians for a man to have not had a youth for a lover presented a deficiency in character plato in his early works the symposium or in phaedrus does not question the principles of pederasty and states referring to same sex relationships for i know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning in life than a virtuous lover or to a lover than a beloved youth for the principle i say neither kindred nor honor nor wealth nor any motive is able to implant so well as love of what am i speaking of the sense of honor and dishonor without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work and if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves they would be the very best governors of their own city abstaining from all dishonor and emulating one another in honor and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that when fighting at each other s side although a mere handful they would overcome the world later however in his laws plato spoke up against the decadence into which traditional athenian pederasty was sinking blamed pederasty for promoting civil strife and driving many to their wits end and recommended the prohibition of sexual intercourse with boys laying out a path whereby this may be accomplished other writers often under the guise of debates between lovers of boys and lovers of women have recorded other arguments used for and against pederasty some like the charge that the practice was unnatural and not to be found among the lions and the bears applied to all relationships between men and youths others charges do not involve traditional pederasty but practices devised for the sexual satisfaction of the strong at the expense of the weak chief among these is denouncement of the castration of captive slave boys as lucian has it effrontery and tyrannical violence have gone as far as to mutilate nature with a sacrilegious steel finding by ripping from males their very manhood a way to prolong their use erotes text at diotima social aspects the erastes eromenos relationship was fundamental to the classical greek social and educational system had its own complex social sexual etiquette and was an important social institution among the upper class pederastic relationships were dyadic mentorships these mentorships were sanctioned by the state as evidenced by laws mandating and controlling such relationships likewise they were consecrated by the religious establishment as can be seen from the many myths describing such relationships between gods and heroes apollo and hyacinth zeus and ganymede heracles and hylas pan and daphnis and between one hero and another achilles and patroclus orestes and pylades it is interesting to note that the greeks tried to project a semblance of pederasty read propriety onto these last two pairs despite a great deal of evidence that the two myths were originally intended to symbolize egalitarian relationships in general the pederasty described in the greek literary sources is clearly an aristocratic institution historical as well as mythographical materials suggest that pederastic relationships required the consent of the boy s father in crete in order for the suitor to carry out the ritual abduction the father had to approve him as worthy of the honor among the athenians as socrates claims in xenophon s symposium nothing what concerns the boy is kept hidden from the father by a noble lover this is consistent with the paramount role of the greek patriarch who had the right of life and death over his children it is also consistent with the importance that a son would have had for him besides the bond of love between them a son was the only hope for the survival of a greek man s name fortune and glory in order to protect their sons from inappropriate attempts at seduction fathers appointed slaves named pedagogues to watch over their sons however according to aeschines athenian fathers would pray that their sons would be handsome and attractive with the full knowledge that they would then invariably attract the attention of men and be the objects of fights because of erotic passions boys entered into such relationships in their teens around the same age that greek girls were given in marriage also to adult husbands many years their senior there was a difference between the two types of bonding boys usually had to be courted and were free to choose their mate girls on the other hand were used for economic and political advantage their marriages contracted at the discretion of the father and the suitor the function of the relationship seems to have been the introduction of the young man into adult society and adult responsibilites to that end the mentor was expected to teach the young man or to see to his education and to give him certain appropriate ceremonial gifts in crete an ox a suit of armor and a chalice from kylix greek for wine cup signifying his empowerment in agriculture war and religion the bond between the two participants seems to have been based in part on mutual love and desire usually sexually expressed and in part on the political interests of the two families a great deal of importance was placed on the friendship between the two as shown by a contemporary proverb a lover is the best friend a boy will ever have the relationships were open and public and became part of the biography of the person thus when spartan historians wrote about a personage they would usually indicate whom it was that he had heard or whom it was that he inspired for the youth and his family one important advantage of being mentored by an influential older man was an expanded social network thus some considered it desirable to have had many older lovers mentors in one s younger years both attesting to one s physical beauty and paving the way for attaining important positions in society typically after their sexual relationship had ended and the young man had married the older man and his protégé would remain on close terms throughout their life for those lovers who continued their lovemaking after their beloveds had matured the greeks made allowances saying you can lift up a bull if you carried the calf pederasty was the idealized form of an age structured homoeroticism that like all social institutions had other less idyllic manifestations such as prostitution or the use of one s slave boys however certain forms were prohibited such as slaves penetrating freemen or paying free boys or young men for sex free youths who did sell their favors were generally ridiculed and later in life were prohibited from performing certain official functions a prosecution by an athenian politician aeschines in 346 bc against timarchus is an example of how these regulations were used to political advantage in his speech aeschines argues against further allowing timarchus an experienced middle aged politician his political rights on account of his having spent his adolescence as the kept boy of a series of wealthy men aeschines won his case and timarchus was sentenced to atimia but aeschines is careful to acknowledge what seemingly all athens knows his own dalliances with beautiful boys the erotic poems he dedicated to these youths and the scrapes he has gotten into as a result of his affairs none of which he hastens to point out were mediated by money even when lawful it was not uncommon for the relationship to fail as it was said of many boys that they hated no one as much as the man who had been their lover see death of king philip ii of macedon likewise the cretans required the boy to declare whether the relationship had been to his liking thus giving him an opportunity to break it off if any violence had been done to him synergy with sports the institution of pederasty was inseparable from that of organized sports the main venue for men and boys to meet and spend time together and for the men to educate the boys in the arts of warfare sports and philosophy was the gymnasium which was preeminently the training ground for these disciplines and one of the principal venues for pederastic relationships in particular the practice of exercising nude was held to be of the utmost importance in the cult of beauty and eros which permeated pederastic societies the cities which have most to do with gymnastics is the phrase which plato uses to describe the states where greek love flourished gymnastics in this instance conveys not only the sense of athletic discipline but also from the greek gymnos nude the fact that all these exercises were taken by men and boys who were naked and thus especially liable to be excited by physical beauty the beauty and erotic power of the naked body was highlighted by the custom of oiling one s body for exercise the provision of oil for such decoration was the greatest expense of a gymnasium and had to be heavily subsidized by the public coffers or private donors the practice itself varied over time in the early days it was said that modesty prevented the boys from drawing attention to their sexuality by oiling themselves below the waist such restraint was presumably cast by the wayside by plato s time the relationship between a trainer and his athletes often had an erotic dimension and the same place which served as training ground served equally for erotic dalliances as can be seen from the many scenes of seduction and lovemaking depicting implements found at palaestras such as sponges and strigils educational and military aspects ancient writers as well as modern historians such as bruce thornton hold that the goal of paiderastia was pedagogical the channeling of eros into the creation of noble and good citizens the various mythographical materials available suggest religious training see story of tantalus poseidon and pelops as well as military training hercules and hylas the theme of learning to drive a war chariot occurs repeatedly poseidon and pelops laius and chrysippus apollo is said to have taught orpheus one of his beloveds to play the harp and zeus had ganymede serve nectar a theme with religious connotations it is thus plausible to assume that even as the loves of the gods paralleled and symbolized those of the mortals their pedagogy pointed to aspects of the educational process that took place between a lover and his beloved in talking about the cretan rite the historian ephorus informs us that the man known as philetor befriender took the boy known as kleinos glorious into the wilderness where they spent several months hunting and feasting with their friends if the boy was satisfied with the conduct of his would be comrade he changed his title from kleinos to parastates comrade and bystander in the ranks of battle and life returned to the philetor and lived in close bonds of public intimacy with him ephorus account does not discuss the educational aspects of the sojourn however this is clearly a coming of age rite culminating in a major ceremony upon the return of the pair from the mountains and a process of acculturation into male society is implied see for athenian practices and philosophy military function military training is inseparable from the other educational aspects of pederasty since the times of the ancient greeks were marked by continuous warfare both internal and external martial prowess was held in the highest esteem and one of the principal functions of pederastic relationships was the cultivation of bravery and fighting skills sexual aspects ancient sources suggest a range of sexual activity cicero describing spartan customs suggests that relations were expected to stop short of consummation the lacedaemonians while they permit all things except outrage in the love of youths certainly distinguish the forbidden by a thin wall of partition from the sanctioned for they allow embraces and a common couch to lovers on the other hand one athenian term for sodomy was to do it the lacedemonian way literary sources are a lot more risqué especially ancient comedy for example aristophanes in peace his parody of ganymede riding on the back of zeus in eagle form has his character ride to olympus on the back of a dung beetle a scatological pun on anal sex some modern historians such as thornton conclude that whether the relationship was consummated or not probably depended on the partners the majority of ceramic paintings depict the older partner importuning the younger in a variation of the greek gesture for pleading normally the supplicant embraced the knees of the person whose favor he sought while grasping the man s chin so as to look into his eyes pederastic art usually shows the man standing grasping the boy s chin with one hand and reaching to fondle his genitals with the other the boys are shown in varying degrees of rejecting or accepting the man s attentions less frequently intercrural intercourse is depicted where the erastes is shown inserting his penis between the thighs of the younger one only very rarely is anal sex suggested or shown a number of sources suggest it was seen as shameful among these is a fable attributed to aesop which tells that aeschyne shame consented to enter the human body from behind only as long as eros did not follow the same path and would fly away right off if he did other literary and epigraphic indications such as the theran grafitti suggest it was more common all this was claimed to be endured by the youth without physical excitement k j dover states that the eromenos was not supposed to feel desire for the erastes as that would be unmanly more recent evidence suggests that in actual practice as opposed to theory there was in fact reciprocation of desire as thomas hubbard points out in a critique of david halperin s contention that boys were not aroused some vases do show boys as being sexually responsive and fondling a boy s organ cf aristophanes birds 142 was one of the most commonly represented courtship gestures on the vases what can the point of this act have been unless lovers in fact derived some pleasure from feeling and watching the boy s developing organ wake up and respond to their manual stimulation the theme of mutuality of desire was a topic of discussion in ancient times as well while the passive role was seen as problematic to be attracted to men was often taken as a sign of masculinity and it was thought that the boys who most sought the company and affections of men were the most likely to be successful in life religious aspects myths provide more than fifty examples of young men who were the lovers of gods poets and traditions ascribe zeus poseidon apollo orpheus hercules dionysus hermes and pan to such love all the main gods of the pantheon except ares had these relationships mythographic material suggests that the initiate experienced ecstatic states of spirit journey leading to mystic death and transfiguration analogous to practices still reported today in shamanic work if so by the fifth century the greeks had forgotten the connection in 476 bc the poet pindar in his olympian ode i claims to be horrified by suggestions that the gods would eat human flesh in this context an obvious shamanic metaphor an opposite theory discussed by murray in his homosexualities gives credence to the texts that credit or blame the cretans with its origination aristotle et al and notes the anomaly of an apparent path of diffusion radiating from crete while the areas in the north of greece closest to the indo european sources are not known to have institutionalized the practice myths also were a vehicle for conveying a set of moral standards for such relationship in the myth of zeus and ganymede when zeus sends gifts and assurances to tros king of troy and father of ganymede the ancients were reminded that even the king of heaven must show consideration to the father of the eromenos many of the other pederastic myths likewise incorporate the presence of the father suggesting an essential role for the father in these relationships the myths also spoke directly to the youths as is shown by a recently discovered version of the narcissus myth this a more archaic version than the one related by ovid in his metamorphoses is a moral tale in which the proud and unfeeling narcissus is punished by the gods for having spurned all his male suitors political aspects the state benefitted from these relationships according to the statements of ancient writers the friendship functioned as a restraint on the youth since if he committed a crime it was not he but his lover who was punished in the military the lovers fought side by side with each vying to shine before the other thus it was said that an army of lovers would be invincible as was the case until the battle of chaeronea with the theban sacred band a battalion of one hundred and fifty warriors pairs each lover fighting beside his beloved pederastic couples were also said to be fundamental to democracy and feared by tyrants because the bond between the friends was stronger than that of obedience to a tyrannical ruler athenaeus states that hieronymus the aristotelian says that love with boys was fashionable because several tyrannies had been overturned by young men in their prime joined together as comrades in mutual sympathy he gives as examples of such pederastic couples the athenians harmodius and aristogeiton who were credited perhaps symbolically with the overthrow of the tyrant hippias and the establishment of the democracy and also chariton and melanippus others such as aristotle claimed that some states encouraged pederasty as a means of population control by directing love and sexual desire into non procreative channels a feature of pederasty also employed by other cultures political leaders solon peisistratus hippias hipparchus themistocles aristides critias demosthenes and aeschines of athens pausanias lysander and agesilaus of sparta polycrates of samos hieron and agathocles of syracuse epaminondas and pelopidas of thebes and archelaus philip ii and alexander of macedon were recorded to have had same sex relationships regional characteristics the structure of pederastic practices varied from one polis to another differences that often became the basis of competition or denigration between the cities for example the character of pausanias in plato s symposium unfavorably compares regions such as elis and boeotia where men are unskilled in speech and boys are permitted to yield uncritically or ionia where boys are forbidden to yield to the superior pederasty of athens and sparta where men are well versed in the art of rhetoric and boys relate critically to their suitors choosing only the most persuasive athens the founder of the pederastic tradition in athens is said to be the lawgiver solon who also composed poetry praising the love of boys the lover was known as the erastes and his young partner as the eromenos or paidika high society generally encouraged the erastes to pursue a boy to love at the same time the boy and his family were expected to be selective and not yield too easily pederastic affairs were the butt of jokes for the commoners athenian philosophers around the end of the fifth century prompted by a discomfort with the lack of self restraint and crude sexuality of some pederastic relationships elaborated a philosophy of pederasty that valorized chaste pederastic relations chalkis chalkis was also known in greece as one of the centers of pederasty leading the athenians to jocularly use the verb chalkidizein for sodomize in talking about the origin of the ganymede myth athenaeus claims that the chalcidians assert that ganymede was carried off by zeus in their own country and they point out the place calling it harpagion initially the chalcidians were said to have frowned on pederasty however being in military straits in a war against the eretrians they called for the aid of a warrior named cleomachus cleomachus brought his eromenos along in sight of the boy he displayed great bravery leading the chalcidian charge against the eretians bringing victory to the chalcidians at the cost of his own life the chalcidians erected a tomb for him in their marketplace and from that time on began to honor pederasty aristotle attributed a popular local song to the event ye lads of grace and sprung from worthy stock grudge not to bravemen converse with your beauty in cities of chalcis love looser of limbs thrives side by side with courage crete the cretans a dorian people described by plutarch as renowned for their moderation and conservative ways practiced an archaic form of pederasty in which the man enacted a ritual kidnapping of a boy of his choosing with the consent of the boy s father aristotle states that it was king minos who established pederasty as a means of population control on the island community this custom was highly regarded and it was considered shameful for a youth to not acquire a male lover these same cretans were credited with introducing the myth of zeus kidnapping ganymede to be his lover in olympus though even the king of the gods had to make amends to the father ionia and aeolia most of the early pederastic elegiac poets with the exception of theognis and tyrtaeus were of aeolian and ionian descent unlike the warlike mainland greeks these were sailors and merchants they seem to have transformed the compulsory doric pederasty of martial apprenticeship into an elective intellectual undertaking and indulged in it extensively their tradition featured poets such as anacreon and alcaeus a man also reputed for his bravery and political skills who composed many of the sympotic skolia that were to become later part of the mainland tradition unlike the dorians where a lover would usually have only on eromenos in the east a man might have several eromenoi over the course of his life from the poems of alcaeus we learn that the lover would customarily invite his eromenos to dine with him however once ionia was annexed by the persians the practice was outlawed this was regarded as reflecting moral weakness on one hand it revealed the rulers greed for power thus their suppression of customs likely to lead to strong friendships and inquisitive minds the product of love on the other it revealed the cowardice of the subjects megara one of the first cities after sparta to be associated with the custom of athletic nudity megara was home to the runner orsippus who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the olympic games and first of all greeks to be crowned victor naked megara was also the home of the poet theognis among whose works are many pederastic compositions often addressed to his beloved cyrnus in his work he associates naked athletics with pederasty happy is the lover who works out naked and then goes home to sleep all day with a beautiful boy many critics hold that his is not the work of a single poet but represents several generations of wisdom poetry the poems are social political or ethical precepts transmitted to cyrnus as part of his formation into an adult megarian aristocrat in theognis own image it has been noted that in the seventh century when pederasty is postulated to have first been formalized in dorian cities megara cultivated good relations with sparta and may have been culturally attracted to emulate spartan practices another poet theocritus describes a local kissing contest for boys and ye megarians at nesaea dwelling expert at rowing mariners excelling be happy ever for with honors due th athenian diocles to friendship true ye celebrate with the first blush of spring the youth surround his tomb there who shall bring the sweetest kiss whose lip is purest found back to his mother goes with garlands crowned nice touch the arbiter must have indeed and must methinks the blue eyed ganymede invoke with many prayers a mouth to own true to the touch of lips as lydian stone to proof of gold which test will instant show the pure or base as money changers know sparta sparta another dorian polis is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity and one of the first to formalize pederasty the spartans believed that the love of an older accomplished aristocrat for an adolescent was essential to his formation as a free citizen the agoge the education of the ruling class was thus founded on pederastic relationships required of each citizen many ancient writers held that spartan pederasty was chaste though still erotic plutarch also describes the relationships as chaste and states that it was as unthinkable for a lover to sexually consummate a relationship with his beloved as for a father to do so with his own son aelian goes even farther stating that if any couple succumbed to temptation and indulged in carnal relations they would have to redeem the affront to the honor of sparta by either going into exile or taking their own lives the lover was responsible for the boy s training pederasty and military training were intimately connected in sparta as in many other cities the spartans claims athenaeus sacrificed to eros before every battle thebes in thebes the main polis in boeotia renowned for its practice of pederasty the tradition was enshrined in the founding myth of the city in this instance the story was meant to teach by counterexample it depicts laius one of the mythical ancestors of the thebans in the role of a lover who betrays the father and rapes the son another boeotian pederastic myth is the story of narcissus theban pederasty was instituted as an educational device for boys in order to soften while they were young their natural fierceness and to temper the manners and characters of the youth the sacred band of thebes a battalion made up of 150 pairs of lovers was unbeatable until its final battle against phillip ii at chaeronea in 338 bc influence on literature and the arts poets write of pederasty from the earliest eras to the end of the hellenistic era five philosophical dialogues debate its ethical implications notable scholars and writers such as plato xenophon plutarch and pseudo lucian would discuss the topic tragedies on the theme became very popular aristophanes made comical theater about sexual relationships between men and youths the famous poets alcaeus ibycus anacreon theognis pindar and of course sappho all wrote of pederastic love aeschylus sophocles and euripides made plays on the subject vases portray numerous homoerotic depictions with hundreds of inscriptions celebrating the love of youths famous politicians warriors artists and writers would enjoy these relationships such idealized relationships held an honored place in their culture from at least 600 bc to 400 ad dialogues the sculptor phidias even memorialized his lover pantarces in marble by inscribing his name on the finger of a colossal statue of zeus during the hellenistic era 332 bc 400 ad plutarch athenaeus and aelian traced the history of greek homosexuality to its beginning ceremonies and proverbs oath of loyalty at the tomb of iolaus in thebes rite undertaken by lovers to consecrate the relationship the iolaeia a yearly athletic festival in thebes consisting of musical gymnastic and equestrian events agones it was held in the gymnasium of iolaus in honor of heracles and lasted several days the winners were awarded brass tripods the hyacinthia festival in sparta honoring hyacinth the mythical young prince of sparta and beloved of apollo the festivities continued for three days with the first mourning the death of hyacinthus and the last two celebrating his rebirth it has been suggested that the cycle symbolizes the development of a youth in such relationships in which he dies as a child in order to be reborn as an adult gymnopaedia spartan dances by naked boys attendance restricted to married men the diocleia festival at megara in honour of diocles lover of philolaus a kissing contest was held in which the boys would kiss a male judge with a wreath awarded to the one with the best kiss a lover is the best friend a boy will ever have you can carry a bull if you carried the calf also in ancient rome as taurum tollet qui vitulum sustulerit said to excuse men s relations with boys who were no longer adolescents modern scholarship the ethical views held in those societies such as athens thebes crete sparta elis and others on the practice of pederasty have been explored by scholars only since the end of the nineteenth century one of the first to do so was john addington symonds who wrote his seminal work a problem in greek ethics in 1873 but had to wait twenty eight years to be able to publish it in revised form in 1901 edward carpenter expanded the scope of the study with his 1914 work intermediate types among primitive folk the text examines homoerotic practices of all types not only pederastic ones and ranges over cultures spanning the whole globe in germany the work was continued by classicist paul brand writing under the pseudonym hans licht who published his sexual life in ancient greece in 1932 mainstream ancient greek studies however had historically omitted references of the widespread practice of homosexuality in 1910 a book called maurice by e m forster made reference to this code of silence by having a cambridge professor employing omit a reference to the unspeakable vice of the greeks four decades later in the 1940s this aspect of greek morals is an extraordinary one into which for the sake of our equanimity it is unprofitable to pry too closely by h michell it would not be until 1978 when an english book on this topic titled greek homosexuality was published by k j dover dover s work triggered a number of debates which still continue at the most basic level there is strong resistance among modern greeks to the portrait of ancient greece painted by modern scholarship that of a culture which integrated and valorized some aspects of same sex love for a period lasting close to one thousand years see discussion of controversy a modern line of thought leading from dover to foucault to halperin holds that the eromenos did not reciprocate the love and desire of the erastes and that the relationship was factored on a sexual domination of the younger by the older a politics of penetration held to be true of all adult male athenians relations with their social inferiors boys women and slaves a theory propounded also by eva keuls from this perspective the relationships are charcterized and factored on a power differential between the participants and as essentially asymmetrical other scholars point to artwork on vases poetry and philosophical works such as the platonic discussion of anteros love returned all of which show tenderness and desire and love on the part of the eromenos matching and responding to that of the ersates critics of dover and his followers also point out that they ignore all material which argued against their overly theoretical interpretation of a human and emotional relationship and counter that clearly a mutual consensual bond was formed and that it is a modern fairy tale that the younger eromenos was never aroused halperin s position has been criticized as a persistently negative and judgmental rhetoric implying exploitation and domination as the fundamental characteristics of pre modern sexual models and challenged as a polemic of mainstream assimilationist gay apologists and an attempt to demonize and purge from the movement all non orthodox male sexualities especially that involving adults and adolescents notes see also age disparity in sexual relationships athenian

 id=1597853 title xanadu house nonfiltered 376 processed 372 dbindex 1500383 the xanadu houses were a series of experimental homes built to showcase examples of computers and automation in the home in the united states the architectural project began in 1979 and during the early 1980s three houses were built in different parts of the united states one each in kissimmee florida wisconsin dells wisconsin and gatlinburg tennessee the houses included novel construction and design techniques and became popular tourist attractions during the 1980s the xanadu houses were notable for being built with polyurethane insulation foam rather than concrete for easy fast and cost effective construction they were ergonomically designed and contained some of the earliest home automation systems the kissimmee xanadu designed by roy mason was the most popular and at its peak was attracting 1000 visitors every day the wisconsin dells and gatlinburg houses were closed and demolished in the early 1990s the kissimmee xanadu house was closed in 1996 and demolished in october 2005 history bob masters who conceived the xanadu house concept was an early pioneer in creating and living in houses built of rigid insulation before creating xanadu house masters designed and created inflatable balloons to be used in the construction of the house he was inspired by the kesinger house in denver by architect stan nord connolly one of the earliest homes built from insulation masters built his first home in 1969 in two and a half days during a blustery snowstorm using the same methods later used to build the xanadu houses masters was convinced that these dome shaped homes built of foam could work for others so he decided to create a series of show homes around the country masters s business partner tom gussel chose the name xanadu for the homes a reference to mongol emperor kublai khan s summer residence xanadu which is prominently featured in samuel taylor coleridge s famous poem kubla khan xanadu is also the name of the palace in the movie citizen kane the first xanadu house was located in wisconsin dells it was designed by architect stewart gordon in 1979 and was created by bob masters it was 4 000 square feet in area and featured a geodesic greenhouse in its first summer 100 000 people visited the new attraction the most popular xanadu house was the second house designed by architect roy mason masters had met mason at a futures conference in toronto in 1980 mason had worked on a similar project prior to his involvement in the creation of the kissimmee xanadu house an experimental school on a hill in virginia which was also a foam structure both mason and masters were influenced by other experimental houses and building concepts which emphasized ergonomics usability and energy efficiency these included apartments designed by architect kisho kurokawa featuring detachable building modules and more significant designs including a floating habitat made of fiberglass designed by jacques beufs for living on water surfaces concepts for living underwater by architect jacques rougerie and the don metz house built in the 1970s which took advantage of the earth as insulation fifty years before xanadu house another house of tomorrow at the century progress exposition in chicago introduced air conditioning forced air heating circuit breakers electric eye doors and other innovative features mason believed xanadu house would alter people s views of houses as little more than inanimate passive shelters against the elements no one s really looked at the house as a total organic system said mason who was also the architecture editor of the futurist magazine the house can have intelligence and each room can have intelligence the estimated cost of construction for one home was 300 000 roy mason also planned a low cost version which would cost 80 000 to show that homes using computers do not have to be expensive the low cost xanadu was never built disney opened the experimental prototype community of tomorrow in florida on october 1 1982 as the epcot center masters and mason decided to open a xanadu house several miles away in kissimmee it eventually opened in 1983 after several years of research into the concepts xanadu would use it was over 6 000 square feet in size considerably larger than the average house because it was built as a showcase at its peak in the mid 1980s more than 1 000 people were visiting the new kissimmee attraction every day a third xanadu house was built in gatlinburg tennessee shortly after the xanadu houses were built and opened as visitor attractions tourism companies began to advertise them as the home of the future in brochures encouraging people to visit by the early 1990s the xanadu houses began to lose popularity because the technology they used was quickly becoming obsolete and as a result the houses in wisconsin and tennessee were demolished while the xanadu house in kissimmee continued to operate as a public visitor attraction until it was closed in 1996 it was consequently put up for sale in 1997 and was sold for office and storage use by 2001 the kissimmee house had suffered greatly from mold and mildew throughout the interior due to a lack of maintenance since being used as a visitor attraction it was put up for sale again for an asking price of us 2 million by october 2005 the last of the xanadu houses had been demolished following years of abandonment and use by the homeless a condominium is planned for the xanadu tract design xanadu house was ergonomically designed with future occupants in mind it used curved walls painted concrete floors rather than carpets a light color scheme featuring cool colors throughout and an open floor plan linking rooms together without the use of doors the modular exterior was reminiscent of a ufo because of the domes built by spraying polyurethane foam onto removable molds xanadu house featured white painted walls a communications pole an outside public toilet and a lake it had at least two entrances and large porthole type windows the interior of xanadu was cave like featuring cramped rooms and low ceilings the interior used a cream color for the walls and a pale green for the floor at the center of the house was the living room in which a large false tree supported the roof and also acted as part of the built in heating system construction of the xanadu house in kissimmee florida began with the pouring of a concrete slab base and the erection of a tension ring 40 feet in diameter to anchor the domed roof of what would become the great room of the house a pre shaped vinyl balloon was formed and attached to the ring and then inflated by air pressure from large fans once the form was fully inflated its interior surface was sprayed with quick hardening polyurethane plastic foam spraying from the inside permitted work to continue even in wet or windy weather the foam produced by the sudden mixture of two chemicals that expand on contact to 30 times their original volume hardened almost instantly repeated spraying produced a five to six inch thick structurally sound shell within a few hours once the foam cured the plastic balloon form was removed to be used again once the second dome was completed and the balloon form removed the two rooms were joined together by wire mesh which was also sprayed with foam to form a connecting gallery or hall this process was repeated until the house was complete window skylight and door openings were cut and the frames foamed into place finally the interior of the entire structure was sprayed with a 3 4 inch coating of fireproof material that also provided a smooth easy to clean finish for walls and ceilings the exterior was given a coat of white elastomeric paint as the final touch interior the xanadu houses used an automated system controlled by commodore microcomputers the houses had 15 rooms each of these the kitchen party room health spa and bedrooms all used computers and other electronics equipment heavily in their design for example the bath could be filled with water at a set temperature on a specific date and time the automation concepts which xanadu house used are based on original ideas conceived in the 1950s and earlier the xanadu houses aimed to bring the original concepts into a finished and working implementation as visitors followed an electronic tour guide of the house featuring constantly changing computer graphics art shows on video screens in the family room they learned about the different advantages and features of the xanadu house including the security and fire systems the main features of the xanadu house design included an electronic hearth featuring a television games console sound system vcr and other electronics equipment an automated kitchen including tele shopping and housekeeping capabilities a family room with several television sets to watch multiple channels at once a telecommunications antenna computer controlled heating and computer controlled electricity and gas usage xanadu house s kitchen was automated by autochef an electronic dietitian which planned well balanced meals meals could be cooked automatically at a set date and time if new food was required it could either be obtained via tele shopping through the computer system or from xanadu s own greenhouse the kitchen s computer terminal could also be used for the household calendar records and home book keeping the xanadu homes also suggested a way to do business at home with the office room and the use of computers for electronic mail access to stock and commodities trading and news services computers in the master bedroom allowed for other parts of the house to be controlled this eliminated chores such as having to go downstairs to turn off the coffee pot after one had gone to bed the children s bedroom featured the latest in teaching microcomputers and videotexture windows whose realistic computer generated landscapes could shift in a flash from scenes of real places anywhere in the world to imaginary scenes the beds at the right of the room retreated into the wall to save space and cut down on clutter the study niches were just the right size for curling up all alone with a pocket computer game or a book the great room was the largest room in the entire xanadu home and included a fountain small television set and a video projector nearby was the dining room featuring a glass table with a curved seat surrounding it behind the seats was a large window covering the entire wall the family room featured television monitors and other electronic equipment covering the walls the builders called the entertainment center an electronic hearth it was planned as a gathering place for family members and relatives just as is a traditional hearth with a fireplace in the spa people could relax in a whirlpool sun sauna and environmentally controlled habitat and even exercise with the help of spa monitors one of the advantages of using computers in the home includes security in xanadu house a hal type voice would speak when someone entered to make the intruder think someone was home disadvantages an initial concern was that the cost of electricity would be excessive since several computers would be running all day all year however mason figured that a central computer could control the energy consumption of all the other computers in the house many believed using computers in the home was a disadvantage because if the computer failed occupants would be restricted from getting food having a bath and even leaving the house if doors are locked many also resisted the concept of computers in the home because of concerns people would become less social those in favor argued that computers improved security and helped get household chores such as cleaning done quickly while the majority of people who visited a xanadu house felt at ease because of the organic design others felt that the concept was not viable because it was badly affected by the weather other architects and designers saw xanadu house as an unprofessional architectural design because of the materials used and the odd use of colors and shapes inside the home designers continued to build conventionally shaped homes dismissing xanadu house as an unsuccessful concept many disliked xanadu house as a practical home because of its low ceilings curved walls and cramped rooms xanadu in print a book about xanadu house entitled xanadu the computerized home of tomorrow and how it can be yours today and written by roy mason lane jennings and robert evans was published by acropolis books in november 1983 the book explains how computers can be used in the home including many concepts in use today such as integrated media centers televisions and sound systems it also describes how the xanadu houses were designed and constructed including interviews with bob masters the book includes several photos of the xanadu houses and discusses several other similar examples of architecture that used rigid insulation or an automated

kahn dean cudworth as officer williams laura mclachlin as female demon 1 stacy soloman as female demon 2 scout taylor compton as fairy 1 jake donahue as fairy 2 trivia the episode title is a slight change of the premiere episode s title something wicca this way comes which in itself is a pun of something wicked this way comes seemingly the last episode of the series but a late renewal from the wb resulted in a season eight during the autumn of 2005 an alternative ending was written by brad kern he pitched both the alternate ending and the ending that aired on the episode to the writers and cast they all agreed that the alternate ending wasn t a good one because it involved the deaths of the charmed ones leading it to close after seven seasons zankou states that they cannot use their powers to uncover the nexus for it is neither good nor evil and will see them as a threat however when phoebe was possessed by the shadow of the nexus in is there a woogy in the house she turned evil due to the fact that the nexus was persuaded to evil or it tapped into her dark side in this episode phoebe and piper are discussing ideas to vanquish zankou in their conversation they mention events from the past these include the confidence spell piper casted on one of the guys working at quake the switching body spell phoebe had cast on herself the love spell casted by phoebe and piper to make men fall for them and the spell that turned everyone at p3 into an animal in the episode piper also mentions that they could turn phoebe into a banshee so she can kill zankou this is the last time the nexus is ever mentioned or referred to in the charmed series the cleaners magical beings who cover up magic used in front of mortals did not appear in this episode yet they should ve since their job is to keep magic a secret from humans and magic was exposed in this episode when the book was stolen from the sisters in the episode witch trial they used the first spell in order to call it back even if they couldn t do it again from afar because zankou protected the book it seems logical that this is the spell they need to get it back leo explains that prue taught him how to astral project before she died this could definitely be so given the fact that she had already developed the ability as a second power in the second season and died at the end of the third season however the episode witch way now also suggest that it s implied prue taught leo the astral projection spell which he in turn taught to the sisters allowing them to temporarily replicate the power zankou thinks he is the first demon to see magic school but actually in the episode styx feet under a demon had previously entered the school also on season eight it is revealed that there are noxon demons hidden in the dungeon leo trapped them there to be used for the advanced combat classes paige as a half whitelighter has been shown to glamour without the use of a spoken spell which falls into true charmed continuity however in this episode piper and phoebe also possess this ability even though they are not part whitelighter and previously had to speak a spell to do so however the episode hyde school reunion suggests there is a spell to temporarily grant a witch the power to glamour which is never heard or used on screen also in the season two episode morality bites there was a spell in the book to glamour ones self there is an appearance by vampires that are led by a new vampire queen this probably implies that there are different vampire covens but it was explained in the season four episode bite me that vampires are immune to witches powers yet piper is able to kill vampire bats with her powers which could mean that this is a weaker coven or piper s powers have grown in the last three years to be able to vanquish novice vampires the power of three spell allows the charmed ones to get their confidence back and allowed them to touch the book of shadows zankou takes phoebe and piper s power in this episode to gain access to the book of shadows when the sisters attempt to destroy the nexus zankou flames into the room and throws them into a wall in the basement when the camera first shows phoebe she has on open toed sandals when they get up phoebe has on tennis shoes paige is able to use her powers in astral form when prue was never able to before her death however prue was known to have been learning how to use her powers in astral mode this would probably be the lesson that phoebe was referring to when she said that prue was protective of the astral projection spell this is
