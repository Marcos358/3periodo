stepien s music career began in 1998 with the release of in the middle of a collection of folky acoustic tracks his music has since infused a more ska reggae feel along the lines of the seminal california group sublime his first foray into poetry came in 2001 with his book i am not here followed in rapid succession by i fall into oblivion and the critically acclaimed the palimpsest mind of christian stepien in 2003 the music scene when stepien s first band split in 1998 he went solo and decided to perform under the name brodie he released a 6 song ep entitled in the middle of in september of that year and soon after dan parker joined him forming a duo for the next two years the two would release an ep and a full length album have two of their tracks featured in a usa network movie entitled the stalking of laurie show and play shows around toronto meeting some of the up and coming bands in the city they became a staple in the scene playing along side friends like billy talent and the meligrove band having gone to high school with the former eventually the two went their separate ways and christian decided to play solo for good as a solo artist and still under the name brodie christian released another ep and yet another full length album in 2003 he decided to drop the name brodie and start performing under his own name poetry takes over in 2001 while taking a poetry course at york university in toronto christian came upon the work of allen ginsberg he immediately took to the poet reading everything he could get his hands on over time stepien s lyrics had become more and more important to him and he was starting to feel that it may be time to bring them out from behind the music that year he published his first book of poetry entitled i am not here it was released in small numbers but was a huge step for christian as an artist the following year he released i fall into oblivion followed in 2003 by the palimpsest mind of christian stepien both books were released to critical acclaim and were accepted into some of the world s most prestigious institutional libraries such as those at oxford harvard and yale photography a new love in 2004 christian s father gave him his original pentax spotmatic camera which he purchased in 1972 stepien took to photography quickly much like with music and poured all his energy into this newly discovered art form shooting at anything and everything he spent the first while getting used to the camera and figuring out the technical aspects of the art a few months later he discovered the work of ansel adams and he knew he had found his calling simply put his goal was not to reproduce the shots adams took but create a similar emotion that stepien himself felt when he looked at ansel s work he focused primarily on landscape photography and spent much of his free time driving through the vast ridge that is the niagara escarpment with his brother damien stepien and girlfriend marina stojanovic in 2006 his first gallery exhibition was held in mississauga ontario along side the work of his brother damien and fellow photographer susie hanes the dagobah project in 2006 christian along with his brother damien created the dagobah project an entity under which all their creative endeavors would be released it is much more then an umbrella term for the brothers however in christian s words the philosophy behind the dagobah project is simple live simple live free live happy we strive to make life as peaceful as possible using art as our vehicle the name dagobah came from george lucas s film the empire strikes back and is the planet where the character yoda lives the stepien brothers decided upon the name not simply because of their affection for all the star wars films but also their admiration for lucas who to this day remains an independent film maker on art i took up the guitar because i loved music but soon came to realize that it gave me an identity where once there was just an average teenager now stood a musician later i turned to poetry because i loved the way simple words if manipulated correctly could evoke such strong emotions in people i soon came to realize that in creating poetry i was reflecting upon my life and in doing so it gave me a sense of self where once there was a simple musician now stood a self aware human being i then picked up a camera and turned to photography because i loved the way the supposedly mundane could have its deserved moment in the spotlight while making photographs i came to realize that in closely examining the world around me i was discovering where i as an inhabitant of this world fit in where once there was an egocentric artist now stood an empathetic human being for me it has nothing to do with money fame or even the products themselves for me creating art is an exploration into the human condition it is about becoming attuned to the world both natural and human and understanding that life is simply a small flash on a ripple in the whirlpool that is the universe empathy humility and wisdom are the goals for which i strive through a vessel that can be summed up in 3 letters art christian stepien

 id=7791739 title north side gang nonfiltered 37 processed 37 dbindex 1480036 the north side gang also known as the north side mob was the dominant irish american criminal organization although a large number of polish and german americans were members as well within chicago during the prohibition from the early to late 1920s and principal rival of the johnny torrio al capone organization later known as the chicago outfit impact of the north side gang history of the north side gang early history the north side gang like many other chicago based prohibition gangs originally formed from the numerous street gangs in existence during the turn of the century particularly the market street gang a street gang made up of pick pockets sneak thieves and labor sluggers which occupied the 42nd and 43rd wards prior to world war i the group especially distinguished itself during the circulation wars of the early 1910s between the newspapers chicago examiner and chicago tribune it was during the circulation wars that future northside leader dion o bannion then a member of the juvenile satellite little hellions who would develop valuable contacts including politicians and journalists o bannion and other members of the northsiders would be mentored by safecracker charles reiser prior to prohibition upon the announcement of the volstead act in 1919 o bannion was one of the many members of the market streeters to enter bootlegging during the first years of prohibition prohibition originally based on the north clark street restaurant mcgovern s saloon and cafe the northsiders upon taking control of the breweries and distilleries in operation following the passage of the volstead act thus ensuring a near monopoly on supplying real beer and high quality whiskey compared to the rotgut liquor and moonshine of rival competitors would soon control the working class neighborhoods of the 42nd and 43rd wards within months of prohibition although they continued committing burglary of local stores and warehouses and running illegal gambling operations strengthening his political protection through election fraud as well as a publicity campaign with large scale donations to orphanages and charities as well as giving out food and loans to the poor and unemployed in the neighborhoods of chicago s north side as sicilian and other italian american gangs arose in chicago s southside such as the gennas and later arrival of johnny torrio and al capone o bannion s steadfast resistance to sell portions of north side distilleries as well as pre existing hostility between irish and italian americans would cause tensions to rise between the two groups during several meetings arranged by torrio o bannion would often provoke the italians weither by direct insults or through hijacking beer shipments and selling it back to the owners however the north side gang would also have trouble with other ethnic gangs including a 1921 incident in which o bannion shot ragen s colts member davy yiddles miller after insulting a north side member at a local opera although o bannion and weiss were arrested and charged with burglary in 1922 the north side gang enjoyed considerable police protection from the chicago police department despite a later investigation by chicago reform mayor william e dever following the attendance of several high ranking police officials including chief detective michael hughes and lieutenant charles evans as well as county clerk robert sweitzer and public works commissioner colonel albert a sprague with a large number of democrat and republican politicians at a banquet hosted in honor of o bannion later dubbed by the press as the balshazzar feast chicago police would also assist the north side gang most notably in the 1924 robbery of the sibly distillery then under federal guard since the beginning of prohibition when o bannion gunmen looted the distillery in broad daylight carrying away 1 750 bonded whiskey worth around 1 million and were escorted by police lieutenant michael grady and four detective sergeants although later indicted charges against grady and the other police officers were quickly dismissed although agreeing in early 1924 to an uneasy alliance with torrio and capone largely brokered by mike merlo relations between the two organizations quickly began to dissolve following o bannion s demands to collect a 30 000 gambling debt from bloody angelo genna who with members of his gang were allowed to be exempted from payment from losses at the co owned gambling casino the ship although torrio persuaded genna to pay his gambling debt o bannion further provoked torrio after arranging a police raid on one of his own breweries when he attempted to sell torrio the valuable sieben brewery on may 19 it was after torrio s release after demands from the gennas that he agreed the gang leader be killed on november 10 shortly after the death of merlo o bannion was killed when three unidentified men entered his flower shop and shot him several times this was to be the beginning of a five year gang war between the north side gang against johnny torrio s chicago outfit that would end only with the st valentine s day massacre in 1929 war with the chicago outfit after the death of dion o banion hymie weiss assumed leadership of the gang and on january 12 1925 weiss with bugs moran and vincent drucci attempted to kill al capone at a chicago south side restaurant firing at capone s car and injuring chauffeur sylvester barton although capone was unharmed on january 24 shortly after the assassination attempt on capone weiss again with moran drucci and frank gusenberg ambushed torrio as he returned from shopping with his wife shooting him several times torrio was wounded along with his chauffeur robert barton as george moran was about to kill the wounded torrio the gun misfired and the gang members were forced to flee the scene as the police arrived although surviving the attack torrio quickly decided to retire to italy and gave leadership of torrio s organization to his lieutenant al capone the northsiders under weiss drucci and moran st valentine s day massacre on february 14 1929 four unidentified men dressed as chicago police officers stormed into a north side street garage and ordered seven members of the north side gang against a wall where they were gunned down the only member to survive peter gusenburg died hours later at a nearby chicago hospital refusing to name his attackers known as the st valentine s day massacre the attack effectively ends the five year gang war between al capone and bugs moran aftermath although moran had survived the attempt on his life as had torrio only years before much of the gangs veteran gunmen were killed in the attack the north side gang still held control over the 42nd and 43rd wards and although an attempt would be made to hold their territory against rivals such as frank mcerlane in 1930 the power of the north side gang slowly declined during the early 1930 s it was later suspected moran was part of the gunmen who killed jack mcgurn organizer of the st valentine s day massacre in 1936 however moran was powerless to stop the national crime syndicates takeover of the north side s gambling operations the organizations only remaining source of income following the end of prohibition and by the

radio presenter in 1996 they were asked by key 103 to co present their afternoon show the duo rapidly established a cult following with their witty and slightly risque banter and in 1998 won a sony radio academy award for their show they were subsequently recruited by virgin radio and again rapidly built up a significant audience for their drivetime show by 2003 they were the most popular djs on the station and were moved to the breakfast show in order to increase the audience this they did very successfully sticking to their well established formula of slightly risque banter about contemporary news and culture with mitchell tending to play the straight man to the more outrageous lloyd lloyd occasionally courted controversy with some of his remarks most notoriously when he expressed willingness to eat the limbs of a dead baby to ease poverty a complaint against the station was upheld and lloyd was reprimanded for his comments nevertheless the audience for the show remained strong despite or possibly because of lloyd s willingness to stray to the edge of acceptability with his remarks on 28 november 2005 to the dismay of their listeners the duo announced that they were splitting up and leaving the breakfast show on virgin radio their final show together took place on 16 december geoff lloyd remained at virgin radio hosting the late show whilst pete

 id=801876 title comstock lode nonfiltered 64 processed 64 dbindex 1480064 the comstock lode is the richest known u s deposit of silver ore discovered under what is now virginia city nevada on the eastern slope of mt davidson a peak in the virginia range after the discovery was made public in 1859 prospectors rushed to the area and mining camps in the vicinity which became thriving centers of fabulous wealth the excavations were carried to depths of more than 3200 feet 1000 meters until the inflow of hot water brought operations to a halt between 1859 and 1878 it yielded 400 million in silver and gold equivalent to approximately 500 600 billion dollars in 2005 as a relative share of gdp it is notable not just for the immense fortunes it generated and the large role those fortunes had in the growth of nevada and san francisco but also for the advances in mining technology that it spurred exhaustion of the mines by wasteful and intensive exploitation started a decline about 1874 that ended in the abandonment of the lode in 1898 the discovery of silver the discovery of silver in nevada in 1858 then western utah territory caused considerable excitement in california and throughout the united states the excitement was one not seen since the discovery of gold in california ten years earlier according to dan de quille a journalist of the period the discovery of silver undoubtedly deserves to rank in merit above the discovery of the gold mines of california as it gives value to a much greater area of territory and furnishes employment to a much larger number of persons gold was discovered in this region in the spring of 1850 it was discovered in gold canyon by a company of mormon emigrants on their way to the california gold rush after arriving too early to cross the sierra they camped on the carson river in the vicinity of dayton nevada to wait for the mountain snow to melt they soon found gold along the gravel river banks by panning but left when the mountains were passable as they anticipated taking out more gold on reaching california other emigrants followed camped on the canyon and went to work at mining however when the supply of water in the canyon gave out toward the end of summer they continued across the mountains to california the camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of 1852 53 when there were 200 men at work along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers long toms and sluices the gold from gold canyon came from quartz veins toward the head of the vein in the vicinity of where silver city and gold hill now stand as the miners worked their way up the stream they founded the town of johntown on a plateau in 1857 the johntown miners found gold in six mile canyon which is about five miles north of gold canyon both of these canyons are on what is now known as the comstock lode the early miners never thought of going up to the head of the ravines to prospect the quartz veins spending their time on the free gold in the lower elevation surface deposits of earth and gravel credit for the discovery of the comstock lode is disputed it is said to have been discovered in 1857 by ethan allen grosh and hosea ballou grosh sons of a pennsylvania minister trained mineralogists and veterans of the california gold fields hosea injured his foot and died of tetanus in 1857 in an effort to raise funds allen and an associate richard burke set out on a trek to california with samples and maps of their claim henry thomas paige comstock was left in their stead to care for the grosch cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery grosch and burke never made it to california suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the sierran trails the two suffered from gangrene and at the hands of a miner surgeon lost their limbs through amputation a last ditch effort to save the lives of the pair allen grosch died on december 19 1857 richard burke lived but upon his recovery returned to his home in canada when henry t p comstock learned of the death of the grosch brothers he took it upon himself to claim the cabin and the lands as his own he also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man what he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein he continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the grosch brothers find was still unclaimed upon learning of a strike on gold hill which uncovered some bluish rock silver ore comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area the four miners that discovered the gold hill outcropping were james fennimore old virginny john bishop big french john aleck henderson and jack yount their discovery was actually part of the comstock lode but not a main vein the four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the grosch brothers tragic fates of the discoverers those who discovered the famous mine were ignorant and not well educated in mineral sciences the blue stuff kept clogging the rockers and eventually the men grew frustrated and discouraged from their gold mining patrick mclaughlin sold his interest in the ophir claim for 3 500 which he soon lost he then worked as a cook at the green mine in california he died working at odd jobs emanuel penrod sold his share of the interest for 8 500 peter o riley held on to his interests collecting dividends until selling for about 40 000 he erected a stone hotel on b street in virginia city called the virginia house and became a dealer of mining stocks he began a tunnel into the sierras near genoa nevada expecting to strike a richer vein than the comstock he lost everything went insane and died in a private asylum in woodbridge california comstock traded an old blind horse and a bottle of whiskey for a one tenth share formerly owned by james fennimore old virginny but later sold all of his holdings to judge james walsh for 11 000 he opened trade good stores in carson city and silver city having no education and no business experience he went broke after losing all his property and possessions in nevada comstock prospected for some years in idaho and montana without success in september 1870 while prospecting in big horn country near bozeman montana he committed suicide with his revolver early mining and milling the ore was first extracted through surface diggings but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies unlike most silver ore deposits which occur in long thin veins those of the comstock lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick the ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated the weakness of the surrounding material resulted in frequent and deadly cave ins the cave in problem was solved by the method of square set timbering invented by philip deidesheimer a german who had been appointed superintendent of the ophir mine previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings capped by a third horizontal member used to support the excavation however the comstock ore bodies were too large for this method instead as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side thus the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice often these voids would be re filled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete by this method of building up squares of framed timbers an ore vein of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth early in the history of comstock mining there were heavy flows of water to contend with this called for pumping machinery and apparatus and as greater depth was attained larger pumps were demanded all the inventive genius of the pacific coast was called into play and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found in any part of the world initially the water was cold but the deeper workings cut into parts of the vein where there were heavy flows of hot water this water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the vein the hot water called for fans blowers and various kinds of vertilation aparatus as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the comstock mines diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use but were discarded for prospecting purposes being found unreliable several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed great improvements were also made in the hoisting cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work as the depth of the diggings increased the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical as their self weight became a significant fraction of their breaking load the solution to this problem came from a s hallidie in 1864 when he developed a flat woven wire rope this wire rope went on to be used in san francisco s famous cable cars in 1859 the americans as a people knew nothing about silver mining in the california placer mines there were however a large number of mexicans who had worked silver mines in their own country initially the comstock miners endeavored to partner with mexicans or at least hire a mexican foreman to take charge of the mine the mexicans adopted their methods of arastras patios and adobe smelting furnaces to process silver ore these methods proved to be too slow for the americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted the americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation the process of amalgamating crushed ore reduced the required days by the patio process to hours by using steam heated iron pans some of the german miners who had been educated at the mining academy of freiberg were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores they introduced the barrel process of amalgamation and the roasting of ores while the barrel process was an improvement on the patio it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the comstock ores as the newly invented pan process by these efforts it was found that the free milling ores of the comstock were not required to be roasted in the early days of pan processing of ores there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver mercury almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore they tried all manner of trash both mineral and vegetable including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea at that time untold millions in gold silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings as the ore on which these experiments were tried was almost pure silver although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented there was much room for improvement improvements were made from time to time resulting in reductions in losses of metals but none of the apparatus in use on the comstock was perfect the days of bull teams and the virginia truckee railroad before railroads were built all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from 10 to 16 horses or mules ore was hauled to the mills by these teams which also brought to the mines all the wood lumber and timber required teams also hauled over the sierras all the mining machinery all supplies required by both mines and mills and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons when the large reduction works of the ophir mining company were in peak operation lines of teams from one to three miles in length moved along the wagon roads and sometimes blocked virginia city streets for hours in 1859 1860 and 1861 great quantities of goods were transported across the sierras to and from california on the backs of mules when the central pacific railroad line was completed this hauling was from virginia city to reno via the geiger grade wagon road for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west ground was broken on the virginia and truckee railroad on february 19 1869 and eight months thereafter the most difficult section from virginia city to carson city was completed rails were extended north across the washoe valley from carson city to reno where it connects with the central pacific between virginia city and carson city at mound house the railroad also connects with the carson and colorado railroad the virginia city and gold hill water company when silver was first discovered on the comstock the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of virginia city and gold hill nevada as population increased wells were dug for domestic needs and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply as the mills and hoisting works multiplied the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents now thousands in number in this need the virginia city and gold hill water company was formed being the first non mining incorporation on the comstock lode water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted it became imperative to look toward the main range of the sierra nevada mountains where there is an inexhaustible supply between the sierra and the virginia ranges lay the washoe valley a great trough nearly 2 000 feet in depth herman schussler a swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in san francisco was brought to the comstock to plan and design the new works surveys were made in 1872 the first sections of pipe laid june 11 1873 and the last on july 25 the same year the initial pipe was made of wrought iron a total length of over 7 miles with an interior diameter of 12 inches and a capacity of 92 000 gallons per hour the pipe traversed the washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon and at the lowest point having a pressure of 1 720 feet of water or 800 pounds per square inch the inlet being 465 feet above the outlet the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure water was brought to the inlet in the sierra nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of 12 miles to virginia city the pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together each section fastened with three rows of rivets lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section the first flow of water reached gold hill and virginia city on august 1 1873 with great fanfare this accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world having superseded the water system at cherokee flat california also designed by schussler the water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in 1875 and a third pipe in 1877 these pipes of lap welded joints deliver more water there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply the sutro tunnel while there was a scarcity of water on the surface there was an excess of water underground in all the mines floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped intrusion of scalding hot water into the mines was a large problem and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased to overcome these troubles adolph sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the comstock lode from the lowest possible point a survey was made by schussler and work commenced in october 1869 the sutro tunnel was completed from the valley near dayton through nearly four miles of solid rock to meet the comstock mines approximately 1 650 feet beneath the surface from the main tunnel branches were run north and south along the vein a distance of over two miles connecting to various mines the tunnel is 16 ft wide and 12 ft high drain flumes are sunk in the floor and over these are two tracks for horse carts it required over eight years to complete construction the tunnel provide drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravity assisted ore removal however by the time it reached the comstock area mines most of the ore above 1 650 feet had already been removed and the lower workings were 1 500 feet deeper still although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served the ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by the use of pneumatic drills big bonanzas peak production from the comstock occurred in 1877 with the mines producing over 14 000 000 of gold and 21 000 000 of silver that year production decreased rapidly thereafter and by 1880 the comstock was considered to be played out the deepest depth was struck in 1884 in the mexican winze at 3 300 feet below the surface underground mining continued sporadically until 1922 when the last of the pumps was shut off causing the mines to flood re processing of mill tailings continued through the 1920s and exploration in the area continued through the 1950s nevada is commonly called the silver state on account of the silver produced from the comstock lode however since 1878 nevada has been a relatively minor silver producer with most subsequent bonanzas consisting of more gold than silver four kings george hearst a highly successful california prospector became head of hearst haggin tevis and co the largest private mining firm in the united

 id=5558649 title dawn to dusk transcontinental flight across the united states nonfiltered 69 processed 69 dbindex 1480069 the dawn to dusk transcontinental flight across the united states was a pioneering aviation record established june 23 1924 it marked the first crossing of the north american continent within the hours of daylight the record was set by 1st lt russell l maughan a u s army air service test pilot at mccook field dayton ohio the site of the air service engineering division and its major flight test center concept and flight plan the plan for the flight was conceived by the air service s assistant chief brig gen william l mitchell in 1923 the air service since 1919 had been regularly establishing endurance distance altitude and speed records in airplanes to promote favorable publicity and public support for the establishment of an air force separate from the u s army the year before lt james h doolittle had flown a dh 4 from florida to san diego in a single calendar day making just one stop in texas for fuel mitchell wanted to not only improve on both the time and distance involved but to have the stunt highly publicized by having it takeoff and land during daylight at major urban centers the military purpose of the flight would be to demonstrate the utility of rapidly moving air units from one side of the nation to the other a capability that the army and navy did not possess the original calculations for the flight were that in early summer including twilight 20 hours of daylight were available for the flight by averaging 160 miles an hour the distance of 2 670 miles from new york to san francisco could be covered in 16 hours 40 minutes mitchell had struck a deal with curtiss aircraft to purchase 25 new pw 8 fighters patterned after the r 6 racer if curtiss would help modify one of the prototypes for use in the project the d 12 engine on the pw 8 produced 435 horsepower and mitchell s intended modifications were to enable it to make the flight at full throttle power setting if the armament and unnecessary equipment were also removed from the xpw 8 additional fuel capacity could be installed to extend its range and larger oil tanks for engine cooling the flight plan calculated four stops of 30 minutes each for refueling mccook field saint joseph missouri cheyenne wyoming and remote salduro siding utah were selected as refueling points following a recently established mail route lt maughan was chosen to make the flight because he was an experienced test pilot and a combat veteran accustomed to dealing with in flight emergencies and because he had already established speed records in 1922 and 1923 the first two attempts to set the record the first attempt to establish the record was flown on july 10 1923 lt maughan took off from mitchel field long island at 4 56 a m the allegheny mountains were obscured by a thick undercast and unable to navigate by landmarks lt maughan flew by dead reckoning arriving at mccook field 90 minutes behind schedule where a broken tail fin rib caused an additional delay the engine of the pw 8 quit in flight over illinois because of a clogged fuel line and lt maughan made a forced landing in a farm field damaging the landing gear and ending the attempt the second attempt to set the record was made on july 19 after a 5 08 a m takeoff lt maughan completed the 570 mile first leg to mccook field at 8 35 a m taking off again at 8 53 a m after reaching saint joseph where he spent 39 minutes on the ground lt maughan experienced severe nausea from oil fumes on the next leg he reached cheyenne however where a broken oil line was found and soldered together approximately 90 minutes after leaving cheyenne the oil line ruptured again and the nausea forced him to land at the air mail field at rock springs wyoming the first two attempts had indicated that maximum performance was stressing the engine of the pw 8 necessitating that additional time be factored into the flight plan with available daylight already reduced by a half hour by the date of the second attempt no further tries were made in 1923 setting the record the next attempt was made using a different plane serial number 24 204 the fourth pw 8 production aircraft curtiss modified it at its long island plant removing its guns and mounts and increasing the 77 gallon fuel capacity by an additional 100 gallons lt maughan took off from mitchel field at 3 58 a m eastern standard time june 23 1924 he flew through intermittent rain and fog but still averaged 135 mph and reached mccook field at dayton at 8 10 a m est although mechanics serviced the plane around in twenty minutes one of the field s mechanics over torqued the filler cap securing it to the fuel intake housing and broke off the valve the housing had to be removed soldered and replaced costing an hour s delay lt maughan encountered thunderstorms between dayton and st joseph but reached saint joseph without incident the grass field there was soft from heavy rain limiting the takeoff weight of his plane unable to take on a full load of fuel lt maughan flew to north platte nebraska where he completely filled the fuel tank but which caused a further 20 minute delay the detour to north platte also resulted in lt maughan encountering a strong headwind slowing his average groundspeed he landed at the air mail field at salduro siding a railroad stop adjacent to the bonneville salt flats at almost 6 30 p m local time and calculated that reaching san francisco by dusk was still possible the last leg of the flight over nevada and the sierra nevada mountains was characterized by cloud strata making navigation difficult in low light conditions lt maughan from logan utah was familiar with the terrain however and recognized sufficient landmarks to approach san francisco bay from the north he used a revolving light on alcatraz island to guide him to crissy field the military airfield at the presidio of san francisco where he landed in front of an estimated 50 000 spectators at 9 46 p m pacific standard time reportedly a minute before dusk maughan s total flight time was 20 hours and 48 minutes in addition to the publicity value of being the first transcontinental crossing within the hours of daylight the flight established new records for time distance and average speed 128 37 mph in trancontinental flights

 id=6103494 title slave craton nonfiltered 72 processed 72 dbindex 1480072 the slave craton is a relatively small archean craton about 300 000 km² located in the northwest territories of canada it is dominated by ca 2 73 2 63 ga greenstones and turbidite sequences and ca 2 72 2 58 ga plutonic rock with large parts of the craton underlain by older gneiss and granitoid units the slave craton is a major component of the canadian shield and one of the most distinct and oldest building blocks of the north american cratonic lithosphere the cratonic block extends from the great slave lake at about 61 n to coronation gulf on the arctic ocean at 69 n it covers longitudinally the area between about 105 w to 117 w the slave includes the acasta gneiss which is one of the oldest dated rock units on earth at 4 03 ga the crust of the slave craton is thought have amalgamated during a 2 69 ga collision between a proto slave western basement complex known as the central slave basement complex and an eastern putative island arc terrane hackett river along a n s suture along the acasta river this basement complex yields protolith ages up to ca 4 03 ga but apart from a central core with sporadic ages 3 5 ga acasta to point lake the central slave basement complex is mostly younger primary evidence for this lies in the n s pb and nd isotope boundaries and the apparent lack of old basement in the eastern slave craton from the several hundreds of kimberlites now known across the craton the following ages have been recorded cambrian siluro ordovician permian jurassic cretacous and eocene bleeker et al 2004 origins of the proto craton and continent formations zircon crystals from the acasta gneiss have been radiometrically dated at 4 4 billion years rocks this old are thought to have been formed by mantle mafic ultramafic and crustal acid magmatism parts of the central slave basement complex reveal quartzite gneiss that is similar to the quartzite found in the southern cross province of the yilgarn craton a potential supercontinent predating 2 8 ga is cautiously hypothesized however the variable age uncertainties of these archean quartzite gneisses most probably reflect an overall distribution of a global 3 0 2 8 ga quartzite peak rather than a direct correlation between the two cratons this peak likely reflects progressive growth and stabilization of continental crust toward the end of the archaean bleeker 2000 the slave craton s amalgamation with the rae craton ca 2 0 ga initiated the growth of laurentia 2 0 1 8 ga within a broader context it originated from the breakup of the much larger late archean parental supercraton sclavia and is a remnant of the supercontinent nuna as a mere fragment of ancient crust surrounded by paleoproterozoic rifted margins it is also a remnant from the break up of a much larger late archean landmass of the supercontinent kenorland the late archean and earliest proterozoic development of slave crust should thus be viewed in the context of this larger supercraton sclavia even though the shape and size of this earlier supercraton is unknown the salient point is that cratons like the slave only preserve parts of the much larger tectonic systems in which they were generated post dating the assembly of laurentia and nuna the slave craton particularly along its margins became partially buried beneath intra continental proterozoic basins at ca 1 269 1 267 ga the craton was partly uplifted and intruded by the giant mackenzie dyke swarm radiating from a plume center west of victoria island this is the last major event affecting the core of the craton although some younger mafic magmatic events affect its edges e g the ca 780 ma hottah sheets since that time slave crust has been bobbing gently up and down with interior seas expanding and receding across the craton ordovician and cretaceous sedimentary rocks and fossils are known as wall rock fragments in some of the central slave kimberlites bleeker 2006 despite the relative stability at the surface melting events were triggered in the subcontinental mantle lithosphere leaving their traces as clusters of kimberlites across the craton from the several hundreds of kimberlites now known across the craton the following ages have been recorded cambrian siluro ordovician permian jurassic cretacous and the eocene bleeker 2006 early archean central slave basement complex the central and western parts of the craton are underlain by a large mesoarchean to hadean basement the central slave basement complex 100 000 km² along the acasta river this basement complex consists of polymetamorphic gneisses of tonalitic to gabbroic composition that yield protolith ages up to ca 4 03 ga apart from a central core with sporadic ages 3 5 ga acasta to point lake the central slave basement complex is mostly younger with important age modes from detrital and protolith u pb zircon ages around 3 40 ga 3 15 ga 2 95 ga and 2 826 ga data from the mantle suggest that at least part of the lithospheric mantle below the central part of the craton may be of similar antiquity pre 2 9 ga supracrustal rocks have been found at the base of some greenstone belts but form only a small component bleeker 2004 sometime after 2 85 ga the nucleus of the meso and paleoarchean sialic crust of the central slave basement complex experienced regional uplift followed by gradual subsidence giving rise first to craton scale unconformity then to the thin transgressive veneer of crossbedded highly mature quartzitic sediments this uplift subsidence cycle is attributed to a mantle plume that gave rise to a subaerial komatiite flow now preserved in the detrital chromite grains in the quartzite units following this uplift subsidence cycle rifting of the thermally weakened crust resulted in voluminous outpouring of pillow basalt flows and intrusion of associated dyke swarms much of the craton was submerged at this time so there is little sedimentary evidence left of this rifting bleeker et al 2000 neoarchean basement complex and central slave cover group by at least 2 9 ga the basement complex formed a thin but widespread ca 2 9 2 8 ga cover sequence of siliciclastic and sedimentary rocks 200 m thick the basement cover contact represents a sheared and metamorphosed unconformity the overall topology of the greenstone belts in the western and central slave province permits all quartzite and banded iron formations to be correlated into a single cover sequence this lateral correlation is supported by the lithostratigraphic similarities that exist over distances of several hundred kilometers the most distinctive lithologies are the detrital chromite bearing fuchsitic quartzite and thin banded iron formations that mark the onset of the neoarchean cycle of supracrustal development the supermature and commonly fuchsitic quartzites mark the emergence and erosional unroofing of the basement complex in what was probably a co2 rich atmosphere abundant detrital chromite suggest contemporaneous komatiitic volcanism similar fuchsitic quartzite sequences occur in many other cratons worldwide particularly between ca 3 1 ga and 2 8 ga all the fuchsite in the quartzite units are considered to be the product of mica producing metamorphic reactions during the shearing and considered to reflect detrital chromite input in many localities fuchsitic orthoquartzite are intercalated with other clastic rocks such as polymict conglomerate and impure mica rich flaggy quartzite pelitic schist occurs between the quartzite rocks and banded iron formation suggesting a progressive deepening of the depositional environment and trangressive migration of the shoreline in most cases the banded iron formations are capped with a thin sulfidic chert layer and then abruptly overlain with massive to pillowed basaltic flows highly magnesian mafic ultramafic lavas have been observed at or near the base of the pillow basalt sequence bleeker et al 2000 after 2 4 ga mature quartzites are rarely fuchsitic the cover sequence itself is overlain by 2 73 to 2 63 ga greenstone belts the neoarchean supracrustal sequence is heavily intruded and cannibalized by plutonic suites ranging in age from 2 72 2 670 ga synvolcanic plutons to 2 59 2 58 ga late orogenic batholithic granites the supracrustal sequences collectively known as the yellowknife supergroup are represented by an early cover sequence comprising quartzite and banded iron formation ca 2 80 ga a thick dominantly tholeiitic greenstone sequence ca 2 70 ga younger arc like sequences ca 2 69 2 61 ga extensive turbidite blankets ca 2 68 2 62 ga and finally syn orogenic conglomerates deposited at ca 2 60 ga or shortly thereafter the early cover sequence and the overlying tholeiites represent subaerial exposure and then volcanic dominated rifting of the basement arc like sequences formed in part on top of the attenuated basement and in progressively widening juvenile back arc like basins and contain some of canada s largest undeveloped volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits after 2 68 ga much of the slave craton became overlain by the burwash basin one of the largest and best preserved archean turbidite basins in the world comparable in size and setting to the japan sea during orogenesis the supracrustal sequences were telescoped thickened and multiply folded between ca 2 65 and 2 58 ga with a peak in crustal anatexis between 2 59 2 58 ga the granite bloom numerous orogenic gold deposits formed throughout the slave craton either as shear or vein hosted deposits in deformed greenstones or within the chemical traps provided by banded iron formations in the turbidites bleeker 2004 the central slave cover group hosts some of the more prominent banded iron formations bif of the slave craton although most are thin 1 10 m and variable in composition along strike changing from oxide iron formation into silicate rich varieties or merely ferruginous chert locally however folding has thickened the highly magnetic bif into substantial thicknesses e g at amacher lake on the eastern flank of the sleepy dragon complex resulting in some of the highest amplitude total field magnetic anomalies in the slave craton bleeker 2006 ca 2 73 2 66 ga volcanism wherever the thin cover sequence is recognized it is overlain by a thick and extensive sequence of tholeiitic basalts with minor komatiite and rhyolite tuff intercalations in the yellowknife greenstone belt this basalt dominated volcanic sequence is known as the kam group possible correlative basalt successions are known across the basement domain as far east as the courageous lake belt and at least as far north as around the exmouth antiform in the acasta area this basalt sequence typically consists of several hundred meters to several kilometres of pillowed and massive flows with thin felsic horizons and intruded by numerous dykes and sills of several generations bleeker 2006 although these lavas extruded in a subaqueous environment regional correlations suggest a basalt sequence approaching lip proportions areal distribution 100 000 km² typical thickness 1 6 km stratigraphy dense dyke swarms and isotopic data link this basalt sequence to the basement well dated components of this widespread basalt dominated sequence yield ages from 2 734 ga to 2 697 ga the widespread basaltic volcanism probably accompanied rifting of the basement complex possibly assisted by mantle plume activity from a mantle perspective it seems inconceivable that events associated with the voluminous basaltic volcanism recorded across the ancient basement terrain did not involve thinning or at least modification of the lithospheric mantle below the central slave basement complex large scale melting was probably triggered by adiabatic rise of asthenospheric mantle perhaps then the ca 2 7 ga basaltic volcanism may have contributed to the highly depleted mantle compositions underlying the core of the craton bleeker 2006 post 2 70 ga volcanism following ca 2 7 ga basaltic volcanism and rifting most areas in the slave craton show a transition to calc alkaline volcanism characterized by abundant felsic and intermediate volcanic rocks calc alkaline basaltic rocks and intercalated volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks in nearly all areas these arc like rocks are stratigraphically overlain by turbiditic sedimentary rocks ages for the arc like volcanic rocks are typically in the range of 2 69 2 66 ga the ca 2 7 ga rifting and basaltic volcanism initiated a complex sequence of events including craton wide 2 69 2 66 ga typically calc alkalic volcanism and sub volcanic intrusive activity these largely juvenile arc like rocks dominate the eastern part of the craton while in the central and western part they stratigraphically overlie basement and its basaltic cover hence the most likely setting appears an arc or back arc like environment that was constructed on highly extended continental crust the craton scale stratigraphic relationships and lack of a suture do not easily support models that invoke collision of an exotic juvenile arc terrane bleeker 2006 ca 2 68 2 66 ga sedimentation starting at ca 2680 ma a broad turbidite basin the burwash basin developed across much of the craton and progressively buried the volcanic substrate a persistence of volcanic intercalations up section and late mafic sill complexes suggest a volcanically active extensional setting perhaps best compared with modern back arcs the minimum size of this basin was ca 400x800 km comparable to that of the japan sea and making it the largest and possibly best preserved archean turbidite basin in the world like the japan sea the burwash basin was largely ensialic in agreement with inferences by early workers the burwash basin fill consists largely of immature greywackes and mudstones deposited below wave base and may locally be up to 10 km thick intercalated tuff layers have been dated at ca 2 661 ga across the slave craton the greywacke turbidites have been given different formational names the classical burwash formation in the yellowknife domain the contwoyto formation in central and northern slave identical in essentially all aspects to the burwash formation further south except for the presence of intercalated iron formations the itchen formation a more mud rich facies in the north central slave and the beechey lake group in the northeastern slave many of the turbidite beds particularly those of the burwash and contwoyto formation are sand dominated with only thin silt to mud sections at the top of the graded beds in the yellowknife domain thick amalgamated sand beds 2 10 m are not unusual petrography detrital zircons and geochemical analysis indicate that the greywacke detritus consists of a mixture of mafic and felsic volcanic rocks and uplifted plutonic infrastructure with only minor input from ancient basement rocks the main axis of the basin and subsequent structural trends appear to have been northeast southwest distinctly across the north south isotopic boundaries that track the nature of deep basement this interpretation is based on the following observations identical burwash formation turbidites extend from the near yellowknife area to the northeastern slave banded iron formations in the turbidites are restricted to the northwest half of the craton suggesting a northeast southwest facies boundary or tectonic trend across the basin earliest folds in the turbidites which formed between 2 65 2 63 ga have northeasterly trends after qualitative unfolding of younger fold generations early folds appear to form a systematic northeast southwest trending fold belt the earliest plutonic suite that intrudes folded burwash strata the ca 2 63 ga defeat suite appears to form a northeast southwest trending magmatic belt across the southeastern half of the craton with more and better u pb zircon ages a tentative volcanic line of 2 661 ga felsic volcanic complexes coeval with turbidite sedimentation has begun to emerge this volcanic line also trends northeast southwest and may represent the first recognition of a linear arc system bleeker 2006 ca 2 65 2 63 ga closure of the burwash basin subsequent tectonic events record the closure and folding of the burwash basin across the southern slave craton with turbidite sedimentation sometime before 2 65 ga the latter age constraint is provided by early plutons of the defeat suite a distinct and possibly subduction related magmatic suite across the southern southeastern slave craton closure of the highly extended but largely ensialic back arc basin allowed considerable shortening and mobility but with a structural style dominated at least at high structural levels by fairly systematic mostly upright northeast southwest trending fold trains at deeper levels e g along the basement cover interface the fold trains must have been detached allowing differential shortening of the basement and cover the folded burwash strata do not represent an outboard accretionary prism which would require a trench setting rather than the more likely back arc setting and there is no evidence for a discrete contwoyto terrane the northeast southwest structural grain of the fold belt is also recognized in the lithospheric mantle shallow subduction may have emplaced distinct mantle slabs these processes terminated with docking of an outboard terrane either in the southeast or the northwest but this terrane is not preserved however within the exposed slave craton crustal thickening led to uplift and erosional exhumation of folded burwash strata and the unroofing of defeat suite plutons detrital zircons of defeat suite age are recorded in younger sedimentary packages bleeker 2006 ca 2 63 ga turbidites 2 63 ga turbidites exist along the northwestern margin of the craton and record a migration of tectonic activity to the northwest deposition was coeval with uplift and erosional unroofing of defeat plutons and the tightly folded burwash formation strata shortly following their deposition these younger turbidites were shortened and intruded by ca 2 616 2 609 ga tonalite granodiorite plutons of the concession suite bleeker 2004 in the multiply folded metamorphosed and intermittently exposed terrain of the western slave craton it has proven difficult to distinguish these younger turbiditic greywackes from burwash basin turbidites there is no sharply defined demarcation line that separates the two turbidite packages and recognition of the younger sequence relies largely on the absence of defeat suite age plutons and the presence of 2 64 ga detrital zircons preliminary work suggests that the younger turbidite sequence contains abundant intercalated iron formations mostly of silicate facies those of the damoti lake area representing one of the more significant examples many of the iron formations are lean comprising background turbiditic greywacke variably enriched in metamorphic garnet other fe rich silicates and or disseminated sulphides a distinct post burwash basin greywacke and or volcaniclastic sediment package associated with felsic volcanic rocks and subvolcanic intrusions and dated at approximately 2 716 2 712 ga occurs along the tightly folded synclinal core of the high lake greenstone belt of the northern slave craton this package is of significance in that it is one of the few examples of a preserved volcano sedimentary carapace to one of the major plutonic suites i e the coeval concession suite bleeker 2006 ca 2 60 2 59 ga final orogeny starting at ca 2 6 ga the entire craton was affected by cross folding and significant further shortening characterized by broadly north south structural trends and probably in response to final collision along a distant active margin of sclavia moderate overthickening of the crust led to ht lp metamorphism widespread anatexis the appearance of s type granites and a hot and weak lower crust culminating in ca 2 59 2 58 ga extension and the regional granite bloom the intrusion of carbonatites and involvement of other mantle derived melts indicate a role for mantle processes possible delamination while peak temperatures were attained in the lower crust large basement cored domes were amplified by buoyancy driven deformation lower crustal devolatilization reactions mobilized gold bearing fluids and syn orogenic clastic basins formed and were immediately infolded into tight synclines at least one of these syn orogenic clastic basins formed as late as ca 2 58 ga late strike slip faulting overprinted and truncated the synclinally infolded clastic basins this event in the craton s evolution transferred

point lake greenstone belt the acasta gneiss is a rock outcrop of archaean tonalite gneiss located in the western section of the northern slave province just west of the emile river the rock exposed in the outcrop formed at 4 03 ga and is the earliest known rock to have survived intact from the earth s early crust plutonic activity occurred in the underlying basement of the acasta area at ca 3 4 ga and the overlying quartzite and banded iron formation of the acasta gneiss complex ar dated at 2 8 ga this cover sequence is conformably overlain by pillow basalt flows and in turn by metaturbidite units this conformably overlying strata is part of the archaen yellowknife supergroup however as part of the central slave cover group the acasta gneisses are unconformably overlain by the fuchsitic quartzite firmly placing the earth s oldest rocks within the old cratonic nucleus of the slave province prior to deposition of the ca 2 8 ga quartzite units the ca 4 0 ga rocks of the acasta river

greenstone belts of deformed pillowed basalt sequences bleeker et al 2000 eastern slave province back river volcanic complex the following study is by breeman et al 2001 the black river volcanic complex is an archaean 2 708 to ca 2 66 ga stratovolcano that lies 480 km northeast of yellowknife northwest territories it constitutes the back group of the yellowknife supergroup and is somewhat anomalous in the slave craton because it has undergone only a low degree of deformation and is subhorizontal the southern half of the complex is exposed at the crest of a small dome this is the eroded portion of the stratovolcano that has been preserved in an upright position the complex comprises four volcanic sedimentary sequences innerring thlewyco boucher regan kelsh that correspond to the phases of growth and destruction of this stratovolcano the innerring sequence which constitutes the oldest rocks of the complex represents the upper part of an eroded early phase of the volcano u pb zircon igneous age of 2 708 ga the thlewyco sequence represents the main construction phase of the volcano and forms an outward dipping annular succession around the innerring sequence with an aggregate thickness of 2500 5000 meters its stratigraphy changes dramatically around the crator varying from five cycles of andesitic and rhylotic lava followed by succession of volcanistic debris on the north side to 30 subarial andesitic flowqs and rare pyroclastic and epivolcaniclastic units on the eastern side to interlayered dacitic and andesitic lava and tuff overlain by a thick succession of voluminous nonwelded ash flow tuff and volcaniclastic rocks on the south side volcanism in this sequence ended with the eruption of large rhyolite and dacite dome flow complexes u pb zircon dated at 2 692 ga the innerring and thlewycho sequences represent a complex history of explosive erruptions from numerous eruptive centers the boucher regan sequence with its predominance of pillowed lava flows suggests that this northern flank of the volcano was submerged during deposition the kelsh sequence on the northwestern side comprises epiclastic volcarenite rhyolite dacite block breccia from lava domes polymict breccia and a conglomerate of andesite dacite rhyolite clasts and andesitic tuff the exposed succession consists of iron formation oolitic stromatolitic carbonate sulphidic volcaniclastic rocks and graphitic slate that marks the end of volcanism the kelsh sequence forms a broad apron that is interpreted as a shallow sunmarine to subaerial clastic fan derived by degradation of the volcanic pile u pb zircon dated at 2 586 ga breeman et al 2001 age determinations in the black river complex are similar to the ages of volcanic rock found in the upper kam group of

of the craton host a variety of mineral deposits and several hundred phanerozoic kimberlites support canada s first diamond mines geologic interest has been renewed in the craton by the discoveries of kimberlite diamond occurrences in the region the eocene ca 55 50 ma kimberlite pipes of the lac de gras area in the central slave craton now support two highly profitable diamond mines ekati and diavik several other diamond mines are in various stages of development in just over a decade diamonds have become the most profitable commodity within this ancient craton the banded iron formations bifs of the slave craton appear to be of low economic value although some may possibly host epigenetic gold mineralization and may be underexplored however most iron formation hosted gold mineralization appears to be associated with bifs hosted in low to medium grade turbidite packages however the burwash formation metaturbidites and the yellowknife greenstone belt do have epigenetic gold mineralization epigenetic gold mineralization throughout the slave craton were caused by deformation and associated metamorphism in the yellowknife greenstone belt it led to formation of the ca 15 million ounce con giant au deposit along a complex system of mostly reverse shear zones as is typical for this class of deposits the con giant system occurs mostly within moderate to strongly deformed basaltic rocks in proximity to a regional stratigraphic break the yellowknife river fault zone an asymmetric synclinal panel of syn orogenic conglomerates the jackson lake formation occurs along this fault zone identical relationships are observed in several other major archean gold camps most notably timmins kirkland lake and kalgoorlie the critical control common to all these camps is localization of au mineralization within significant bends of the regional fault zones these bends were most likely dilational during emplacement of the gold bearing quartz veins although numerous other volcanic hosted gold vein systems are known from the slave craton some of which were briefly in production in the past only one other major camp has emerged in recent years this camp occurs in the hope bay belt on the coronation gulf coast of the slave craton and consists of a string of deposits boston doris madrid that are being readied for production elsewhere despite significant past exploration overall potential for this class of deposits remains excellent several greenstone belts throughout the slave craton have very similar structural stratigraphic characteristics to that of the yellowknife belt including a thick folded turbidite pile adjacent to a basaltic greenstone belt a regional deformation zone and a young conglomerate package best examples are the point lake and arcadia bay areas bleeker 2006 another class of mineral deposits related to final orogenesis is that of rare element enriched granitoids particularly highly evolved anatectic granites and their pegmatites tin cassiterite and li spodumene were briefly mined from such pegmatites in the yellowknife domain but other pegmatite fields are known throughout the slave craton from a global metallogeny

detrital minerals including highly stable heavy minerals such as chromite zircon and rutile individual dark detrital chromite grains are a characteristic feature of these otherwise white to grey quartzites commonly these chromite grains have undergone variable reaction towards bright green fuchsitic mica during metamorphism and deformation in a few localities chromites are concentrated in seams of black sand but clearly such concentrations are too small to be of economic interest if road access were available some of the green white quartzite would make attractive building or

 id=1620654 title north american a 36 nonfiltered 73 processed 73 dbindex 1480073 the north american a 36a apache invader was the ground attack dive bomber version of the north american p 51 mustang from which it could be distinguished by the presence of rectangular slatted dive brakes above and below the wings a total of 500 a 36a dive bombers served in north africa the mediterranean italy and the china burma india theater during world war ii before being withdrawn from operational use in 1944 design and development with the introduction of the north american mustang i with the raf army co operation squadrons in february 1942 the new fighter began combat missions as a low altitude reconnaissance and ground support aircraft supplementing the curtiss p 40 tomahawks already in service mustang is were first supplied to no 26 squadron raf then rapidly deployed to ten additional squadrons by june 1942 drawing first blood over dieppe on 19 august 1942 a no 414 rcaf squadron mustang downed the formidable focke wulf fw 190 the first victory for a mustang despite the limiting high altitude performance of the allison v 1710 engine the raf was enthusiastic about its new mount which performed magnificently during the mustang i s successful combat initiation north american s president howard dutch kindelberger pressed the newly redesignated usaaf us army air force for a fighter contract for the essentially similar p 51 47 of which had passed into the usaaf when the lend lease contract with britain ran out of funds the p 51 utilized four 20 mm wing cannons replacing the original four 30 caliber and two 50 caliber browning machine guns mounted in the wings and two 50 caliber chin machine guns no funds were available for new fighter contracts in fiscal year 1942 but general oliver echols wanted to ensure the p 51 remained in production since appropriations were available for an attack aircraft echols specified modifications to the p 51 to turn it into a dive bomber the contract for 500 a 36a aircraft fitted with bomb racks and dive brakes was in place 16 april 1942 even before the first flight of the p 51 in may 1942 with orders on the books north american aviation naa began modifying the p 51 to accept the bomb shackles that were already tested in a long range ferry program that the raf had stipulated engineering studies totalling 40 000 hours and wind tunnel testing with a 1 8 scale model was completed in june 1942 utilizing the basic p 51 airframe and allison engine structural reinforcing beefed up several high stress areas and a set of hydraulically operated dive brakes were installed in each main wing plane due to the slightly inboard placement of the bomb racks and unique installation of four cast aluminum dive brakes a complete redesign of the p 51 wing was required the usaaf also had 310 p 51as on order that were differentiated by having provision for drop tanks an armament of only four wing mounted 0 50 in browning machine guns and an allison v 1710 81 1200 hp 91248 kgm like the a 36a the p 51a was fitted with bomb racks but was not intended for use primarily as a fighter bomber the first a 36a 42 83663 was rolled out of the naa inglewood plant in september 1942 rapidly going through flight testing with the first flight in october and deliveries commencing soon after of the first production machines the a 36a continued the use of nose mounted 50 caliber machine guns along with wing armament of four 50 caliber machine guns another major alteration was the use of a sea level rated allison v 1710 87 that delivered 1325 hp at 3000 ft but had greatly reduced output above 12 000 ft operational service the a 36a 1na apache the a 36a s official name was rarely used joined the 27th fighter bomber group composed of four squadrons based at rasel ma in french morocco in april 1943 during north africa the 27th had a mixed component of douglas a 20 havocs and a 36as while the second operational unit the 86th fighter bomber group dive arrived in march 1943 with the first pilots trained and qualified on the a 36a on 6 june 1943 both of these a 36a units flew combat missions directed against the island of pantelleria the island fell to allied attack and became the home base for the two a 36a groups during the invasion of sicily the a 36a proved to be a potent weapon it could be put into a vertical dive at 12 000 ft deploying its dive brakes limiting the dive speed to 390 mph pilots soon recognized that extending the dive brakes after peel off led to some unequal extension of the brakes due to varying hydraulic pressure setting up an invariable slight roll which impeded aiming proper technique soon cured this anomaly and subsequently pilots achieved extremely consistent results depending on the target and defences the bomb release took place between 2 000 ft and 4 000 ft followed by an immediate sharp pull up dive brakes in the wings gave the a 36a greater stability in a dive but a myth had arisen that they were useless due to malfunctions or because of the danger of deploying them and that they should be wired closed capt charles e dills 27th fighter bomber group 522nd squadron xiith air force emphatically stated in a postwar interview i flew the a 36 for 39 of my 94 missions from 11 43 to 3 44 they were never wired shut in italy in combat this wired shut story apparently came from the training group at harding field baton rouge la however tactical reconnaissance training with p 51 and a 36 aircraft had delivered some disquieting accident rates at one time a 36 training had resulted in the type having the highest accident rate per hour s flying time of any usaaf aircraft the most serious incident involved an a 36a shedding both wings when its pilot tried to pull out from a 450 mph dive combat units flying the a 36a were ordered to restrict their approach to a 70 glide attack and refrain from using dive brakes this order was generally ignored by experienced pilots but some units did wire dive brakes shut until modifications were made to the hydaulic actuators nevertheless the a 36 was used with great success as a dive bomber acquiring a reputation for precision sturdiness and silence by late may 1943 300 a 36as had been deployed to the mediterranean theater with many of the first batch sent to the 27th to re build the group following losses as well as completing the final transition to an all a 36a unit both groups were actively involved in air support during the sicilian campaign becoming especially adept at mopping up enemy gun positions and other strong points as the allies advanced during this operation the 27th group circulated a petition to adopt the name invader for their rugged little bomber receiving unofficial recognition of the more fitting name despite the name change most combat reports preferred the name mustang for all of the variants the germans gave it a flattering if fearsome accolade calling the a 36as screaming helldivers besides dive bombing the a 36a racked up aerial victores totalling 84 enemy aircraft and an ace lieutenant michael t russo from the 27th fighter bomber group ultimately the only ace using the allison engined mustang as fighting intensified in all theaters where the a 36a operated the dive bomber began to suffer an alarming loss rate with 177 falling to enemy action the main reason for the attrition was the hazardous missions that placed the a 36a on the deck facing murderous ground fire german defences in southern italy included placing cables across hill tops to snare the attacking a 36as despite establishing a reputation for reliability and performance the one achilles heel of the a 36a and the mustang remained its vulnerable cooling system leading to many of the losses by june 1944 a 36as in europe were replaced by curtiss p 40s and republic p 47 thunderbolts a 36as had also served with the 311th fighter bomber group in the china burma india theater the 311th had arrived in dinjan india by late summer 1943 after being shipped across the pacific via australia two squadrons were equipped with the a 36a while the third flew p 51as tasked with reconaissance dive bombing attack and fighter missions the a 36a was outclassed by its main oppossion the nakajima ki 43 hayabusa codenamed oscar the light and highly agile japanese fighter could outfly the a 36a at all altitudes but did have some weak points it was lightly armed and offered little protection for pilot or fuel tanks however the a 36a fought at a significant disadvantage having to carry out long range missions often at altitudes above the hump that meant its allison engine was below peak performance in a fighter escort mission over burma three a 36as were lost without scoring a single victory the a 36a cbi missions continued throughout 1943 1944 with indifferent results the a 36a remained in service in small numbers throughout the remaining year of the war some being retained in the us as training aircraft legacy the type s relatively brief service life should not camouflage the fact that it made a major contribution to the allied war effort especially in the mediterranean and it amounted to the first usaaf combat use of a mustang variant operators us army air force survivors relatively few a 36as survived the war and the subsequent postwar retirement and scrapping of obsolete types one a 36a bearing race number 44 owned and flown by kendall everson was entered in the 1947 kendall trophy race the old warhorse was able to reach 377 926 mph finishing

 id=2317493 title ernst nolte nonfiltered 79 processed 78 dbindex 1480079 ernst nolte born 11 january 1923 is a german historian born in witten germany to a roman catholic family nolte was a student of martin heidegger nolte s major interest is the comparative studies of fascism and communism his work has been the object of extreme controversy fascism in its epoch nolte first rose to fame with his 1963 book der faschismus in seiner epoche fascism in its epoch translated into english as the three faces of fascism in which nolte argued that fascism arose as a form of resistance and a reaction against modernity using the methods of phenomenology nolte subjected german nazism italian fascism and the french action française movements to a comparative analysis nolte s conclusion was that fascism was the great anti movement namely it was anti liberal anti communist anti semitic anti capitalist and anti bourgeois in nolte s view fascism was the rejection of everything the modern world had to offer and was an essentially negative phenomenon the three faces of fascism was much praised at the time and since as a seminal contribution to the creation of a theory of generic fascism roger griffin has written that although written in an excessively arcane and obscure language nolte s theory of fascism as a form of resistance to transcendence transcendence in german can be translated as the spirit of modernity marked an important step in the understanding of fascism and helped to spur scholars into new avenues of research on fascism later in the 1970s nolte was to reject the theory of generic fascism that he had championed in the three faces of fascism and instead embraced totalitarian theory as a way of explaining both nazi germany and the soviet union in nolte s opinion nazi germany was a mirror image of the soviet union and with the exception of the technical detail of mass gassing everything the nazis did the communists in russia did first the historikerstreit nolte is best known for his role in launching the historikerstreit historian s dispute of 1986 1987 on june 6 1986 nolte published an article entitled vergangenheit die nicht vergehen will the past that will not go away in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung his article was a distillation of ideas that nolte had first introduced in lectures that he delivered in 1976 and in 1980 nolte advanced the view that the crimes of the nazis were only a defensive reaction against the crimes of the soviets in nolte s view national socialism had only arisen in response to the class genocide and asian barbarism of the bolsheviks along the same lines nolte argued that the holocaust or racial genocide as nolte prefers to call it was an understandable if excessive response on the part of adolf hitler to the soviet threat nolte labeled the holocaust an überschießende reaktion overshooting reaction to bolshevik crimes as proof of this argument nolte presented a letter written by chaim weizmann the president of the world zionist organization on september 3 1939 to the british prime minister neville chamberlain pledging full and unconditional support to the british war effort nolte has called weizmann s letter to chamberlain a jewish declaration of war against germany see also judea declares war on germany the second piece of evidence nolte presented was a book written in 1940 by the american author theodore n kaufman called germany must perish that appealed to have all german men sterilized nolte argued that the nazis felt forced to stage the holocaust because hitler concluded that entire jewish population of the world had declared war on germany from nolte s point of view the holocaust was act of asian barbarism forced on the germans out of the fear over what joseph stalin who nolte charged had significant jewish support might do to them nolte has argued that after the japanese attack on the united states in 1941 the u s authorities interned the entire japanese american population so by the same logic the germans were within their rights to intern the jewish population of europe in concentration camps subsequently nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book der europäische bürgerkrieg 1917 1945 the european civil war 1917 1945 in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide totalitarianism and tyranny and that the holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence terror and population displacement nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the armenians during world war i and also included the stalinist terror in the soviet union maoist terror in china as manifested in such events as the great leap forward and the cultural revolution compulsory population exchanges between greece and turkey in 1922 1923 and the khmer rouge genocide in cambodia in nolte s view the great deciding event of the 20th century had been the russian revolution of 1917 which in nolte s view plunged all of europe into a long simmering civil war that lasted until 1945 in nolte s opinion fascism which was communism s twin arouse as a desperate response by the threatened middle classes of europe to what nolte has often called the bolshevik peril these views ignited a firestorm of controversy most historians in west germany and virtually all historians outside germany condemned nolte s interpretation as factually incorrect and as coming dangerously close to justifying the holocaust some of the historians who denounced nolte s work included hans mommsen martin broszat hans ulrich wehler heinrich august winkler wolfgang mommsen karl dietrich bracher and eberhard jäckel criticism from abroad came from ian kershaw gordon a craig richard j evans saul friedländer john lukacs michael marrus and timothy mason wehler was so enraged by nolte s views that he wrote a book entsorgung der deutschen vergangenheit ein polemischer essay zum historikerstreit in 1988 which as its title indicates comprised twenty polemicial essays attacking every aspect of nolte s views coming to nolte s defence were the journalist joachim fest and the historians klaus hildebrand rainer zitelmann and hagen schulze in particular nolte s evidence for a jewish war on germany has been dismissed it has been argued that weizmann s letter to chamberlain was written in his capacity as head of the world zionist organization not on behalf of the entire jewish people in europe and at any rate must be seen in the light of weizmann s appeasing stance towards the british government in general and that nolte s views are based on the spurious idea that all jews are zionists and so follow the lead of zionist leaders furthermore it has been contended that there is no evidence that hitler ever heard of weizmann s letter as for kaufman s book the nazis were certainly aware of it during the war germany must perish was translated into german and widely promoted as an example of what jews thought about germans but most historians contended that the views of one american jew can in no way be taken as typical of what all european jews were thinking and to put the call for the forced sterilization of germans that was never carried out as allied policy in the same league as the holocaust shows a profound moral insensitivity moreover it has been shown that there is no indication that the kaufman s book ever played any role in the decision making progress that led to the holocaust finally it has been contended that nolte s comparison of the holocaust with the internment of the japanese americans is false because jews were sent to death camps not concentration camps and that the u s government did not attempt to exterminate the japanese americans in the interment camps nolte s critics have frequently charged him with having neo nazi and anti semitic sympathies nolte has always vehemently denied these charges and has insisted that he is a neo liberal in his politics nolte is by his own admission an intense german nationalist and his stated goal is to restore the sense of pride in their history that he feels the germans have been missing since 1945 nolte s defenders have pointed to numerous statements on his part condemning nazi germany and the holocaust nolte s critics have acknowledged these statements but go on to claim that nolte makes arguments that can be construed as being sympathetic to the nazis such as his defence of the commissar order as a legitimate military order or his use of nazi era language such as nolte s practice of referring to the red army soldiers in world war ii as asiatic hordes in particular controversy has centered around an argument that nolte made in his 1985 essay between myth and revisionism from the book aspects of the third reich in his essay nolte argued that if the plo were to destroy israel then the subsequent history written in the new palestinian state would portray the former israeli state in the blackest of colors in nolte s opinion a similar situation exists in regards to the history of nazi germany many historians such as the british historian richard j evans have claimed that by making this argument nolte is attempting to claim that the only reason why nazism is seen is evil is because germany lost world war ii not because of the holocaust nolte has always denied these allegations of nazi sympathies likewise nolte has pointed out that he always refused frequent offers to speak at the gatherings of the institute for historical review nolte s critics such as deborah lipstadt have charged that the nature of nolte s arguments about the holocaust has led to these frequent invitations to speak at the i h r lipstadt has argued that in her view the nature of nolte s work is a more insidious and dangerous form of holocaust denial then the work of david irving in june 2000 nolte was awarded the konrad adenauer prize for literature the award attracted widespread protests and controversy currently nolte is a

 id=672765 title folkspraak nonfiltered 81 processed 80 dbindex 1480081 folkspraak other variants are common see name is an international auxiliary language ial project based on the germanic languages currently in development it is intended to be quickly learnable by all germanic speakers a group including over 465 million native speakers and an additional 300 to 900 million who speak english as a second language it is not meant to be designed by any one individual but is a collective work created by all interested parties according to the folkspraak charter guidelines discussion and dialects currently no final version of folkspraak exists with several developers having their own versions displaying their own preferences though some form of homogenisation is generally the eventual aim thus there are currently disagreements about many rather basic areas of the language including orthography grammar and vocabulary interestingly many of the dialects proposed tend to look most like an english influenced version of dutch or low german although many have notably north germanic features the guiding idea for building the vocabulary is that a word from the same root with the same or similar meaning should be common or exist in three out of four core languages general english high german dutch and swedish norwegian danish the scandinavian languages are often counted as one language here and a word wouldn t need to be common in more than one of these languages since many common words are often found in only two core languages at most this method has not been proven sufficient for creating a complete germanic auxiliary language several different methods have been elaborated to get cross the problem including accept that a word only found in two different core languages should hold valid this method would often create many synonyms using more common synonyms or compounds such as werk schy arbeid schy for lazy work shy using smaller less common germanic languages including low german afrikaans yiddish frisian icelandic using the word most common in proto germanic referring to words common in other auxiliary languages or large language families such as interlingua or slovio name folkspraak has traditionally been what the language has been referred to as but as different versions of the language have different phonemic and graphemic realisations of historical phonemes and also different capitalization and punctuation rules the realisation of the name changes accordingly in each version thus some would write folkspraak others folksprak folk spraak folksprâk folkspræk etc the basic form of the word is the proto germanic roots fulka source of english folk and german volk and sprækijo source of speech and sprache meaning people and language respectively the compound thus means people language with the implication language of the people it is debatable whether it would be better rendered with a genitive s suffix on the fulka element thus yielding something of the form folksspraak with the clear meaning people s language middelsprake there is also the related inter germanic conlang middelsprake designed independently by ingmar roerdinkholder now a member of the folkspraak yahoo group middelsprake turned out to be rather close to folkspraak some of the differences are that some of the versions of folkspraak include archaic orthography and phonology which are not present in the modern germanic languages and compared to these versions middlesprake has a more regular and simple spelling and pronunciation and to some extent grammar middelsprake is based on the comparison between eight living germanic languages english german dutch danish swedish low saxon frisian and nynorsk norwegian and is an intermediate language between west germanic and scandinavian varieties test subjects have been able to understand almost completely at first sight including people from germany the netherlands denmark sweden even english speakers can recognize a lot of their own wordstock in it f lkspræk folksprak a version of folkspraak called f lkspræk also called meta folksprak and boksprak has been developed by stephan schneider its phoneme inventory is based on reconstructed proto germanic diacritic signs are used in order to represent etymological and grammatical phenomena for instance the ring above u in the name f lkspræk shows a proto germanic u which turned to o in at least one of the modern germanic languages such as english in this case cf folk folksprak n b single a is based on f lkspræk and therefore it is based in turn on proto germanic this means it is not unlike middelsprake a blend of modern germanic languages but an artificial and hopefully thus logical and indeed simple member of the germanic language family folksprak is nonetheless very similar in realisation to the real modern germanic languages because it features phoneme shifts following those seen in the development of modern germanic for instance the proto germanic u in the word f lkspræk turns to o in folksprak as in modern germanic folksprak uses the english alphabet plus two extra vowels æ and ø this division into f lkspræk and folksprak was supposed to help the folkspraak developers to focus both on proto germanic influences on folkspraak and orthographic simplicity in theory f lkspræk is able to represent any modern germanic word e g english mouse as mûs the lord s prayer as an example of folkspraak in comparison to other germanic languages consider five proposed versions of the lord s prayer next to the dutch

 id=5260722 title virtualgl nonfiltered 95 processed 93 dbindex 1480095 virtualgl is an open source program which redirects the 3d rendering commands from unix and linux opengl applications to 3d accelerator hardware in a dedicated server and displays the rendered output interactively to a thin client located elsewhere on the network the problem normally vnc and other thin client environments for unix and linux either do not support running opengl applications at all or force the opengl applications to be rendered without the benefit of opengl hardware acceleration remotely displaying 3d applications with hardware acceleration has traditionally required the use of indirect rendering indirect rendering uses the glx extension to x windows to encapsulate the opengl commands inside of the x windows protocol stream and ship them over the network from the application server to an x windows server running on the user s desktop all of the opengl commands are executed on the user s desktop so the client machine must have a fair amount of cpu memory and graphics rendering horsepower indirect rendering can be shown to perform well if the network is sufficiently fast gigabit ethernet for instance if the application does not dynamically modify the geometry of the object being rendered if the application uses display lists and if the application does not use a great deal of texture mapping but many opengl applications do not meet these criteria to further complicate matters it is often the case that opengl extensions such as vertex fragment programs vertex arrays etc do not work in an indirect rendering environment some of these extensions require the ability to directly access the 3d graphics hardware and thus can never be made to work indirectly in other cases either the server s opengl library or the client s x server do not provide explicit support for the needed opengl extension or the extension relies on a specific hardware configuration that is not present on the client machine performing opengl rendering on the server circumvents the issues introduced by indirect rendering since the application now has a fast and direct path to the 3d rendering hardware if the rendering occurs on the server then only the resulting 2d images must be sent to the client images can be delivered at the same frame rate regardless of how big the 3d data was that was used to generate them so performing 3d rendering on the server effectively converts the 3d performance problem into a 2d performance problem the problem then becomes how to stream 1 2 megapixels of image data over a network at interactive frame rates but commodity technologies hdtv to name one already exist to address this problem virtualgl s solution virtualgl uses glx forking to implement server side opengl rendering unix and linux opengl applications normally send glx commands to the x server to bind opengl rendering contexts to a particular x window obtain a list of pixel formats that the x server supports etc but if the x server is in fact a thin client proxy application such as vnc that doesn t support the glx x windows extension then these applications will fail to execute virtualgl takes advantage of a feature in unix and linux that allows one to preload a library into an application effectively intercepting aka interposing certain function calls that the application would normally make to shared libraries with which it is linked once virtualgl is preloaded into a unix or linux opengl application it intercepts the glx function calls from the application and redirects them onto the server s x display which presumably has a 3d hardware accelerator attached in the process of redirecting the glx calls virtualgl also modifies the calls in order to force opengl rendering to occur in off screen pixel buffers pbuffers rather than in x windows meanwhile the rest of the function calls from the application including non opengl x windows calls are allowed to pass through without modification internally virtualgl s interposer engine also maintains a map of windows to pbuffers matches visual attributes between the destination x server and the x server on which the 3d rendering will occur and performs a variety of other hashing functions to assure that the glx redirection is seamless but essentially once the opengl context is established on the server s display virtualgl gets out of the way and allows all subsequent opengl commands to pass through unimpeded to the server s 3d hardware thus the application can automatically use whatever opengl features and extensions are provided by the server s hardware and drivers apart from marshalling glx commands and managing pbuffers virtualgl also reads back the rendered pixels at the appropriate time usually by monitoring glxswapbuffers or glfinish and then draws those pixels into the appropriate x window using standard x image drawing commands since virtualgl is redirecting the glx commands away from the destination x server it can be used both to add 3d support to x proxies such as vnc which lack 3d support as well as to prevent indirect opengl rendering from occurring in a remote x display scenario using virtualgl in concert with vnc or another x proxy allows multiple users to simultaneously run 3d applications on a single server and multiple clients to share each session however vnc and its ilk are tuned to handle 2d applications with large areas of solid color few colors and few inter frame differences 3d applications on the other hand generate images with fine grained complex color patterns and much less correlation between subsequent frames the workload generated by drawing rendered images from an opengl application into an x window is essentially the same workload as a video player and off the shelf thin client software typically lacks sufficiently fast image codecs to be able to handle this workload with interactive frame rates virtualgl works around this problem in two ways turbovnc direct mode turbovnc turbovnc is an offshoot of tightvnc which accelerates the jpeg encoding paths of the latter by taking advantage of hand tuned multimedia primitives from intel and sun microsystems when used with virtualgl turbovnc is capable of streaming the output of a full screen 1280x1024 3d application at greater than 15 frames second with perceptually lossless image quality on 100 megabit ethernet turbovnc includes further optimizations to allow it to achieve 7 10 frames second over broadband with noticeable but usable image quality loss turbovnc also extends tightvnc to include client side double buffering and optimized binaries for solaris turbovnc and virtualgl are used by the texas academic computing center at ut to allow users of the teragrid to remotely access the 3d rendering capabilities of the maverick terascale visualization supercomputer direct mode in direct mode virtualgl compresses the rendered 3d images in process using the same optimized jpeg codec that turbovnc uses virtualgl then sends the compressed images directly to a virtualgl client application running on the client machine the virtualgl client is responsible for decompressing the images and drawing the pixels into the appropriate x window meanwhile the non opengl elements of the application s display are sent over the network using the standard remote x windows protocol and rendered on the client machine this approach requires that an x server be present on the client machine and the reliance upon the remote x windows protocol means that direct mode performs poorly on high latency networks additionally direct mode does not inherently support collaboration multiple clients per session since the images are being pushed to the client rather than pulled from the server but direct mode does provide a completely seamless application experience whereby every application window corresponds to a single desktop window direct mode also provides better performance than turbovnc on local area networks and reduces the server cpu load since the 2d rendering is now occurring on the client the developers of virtualgl envision the primary users of direct mode to be laptop users connected to the 3d server with 802 11g wireless or fast ethernet see also x window system xgl aiglx opengl vnc external links virtualgl home page

captive scientist dr lucius guardian who decides to give the two escapees its control device a miniature transmitter built into a wristwatch the robot can only be controlled by the first voice that is recorded in its electronic brain but he first needs to be charged up by atomic energy dr guardian helps daisaku and j r escape only to be shot to death but not before he set an atomic bomb that destroyed the base the resulting explosion activates the giant robot which moves to daisaku s every command as the controller of the robot heretofore known as giant robo or just giant robot in the us daisaku is invited by j r and his chief azuma to join unicorn as its 7th member u7 as u7 daisaku fights the evil forces of big fire with the help of u3 j r and giant robo in the final episode giant robot directly confronts guillotine who has grown to the same size as giant robot guillotine claims that his body at that size is capable of creating a nuclear explosion capable of wiping out the earth and demonstrates his power by ripping off one of his fingernails and producing a small nuclear explosion as the earth hovers on the brink of surrender to guillotine giant robot despite daisaku s commands to the contrary attacks guillotine picks him up and flies into outer space at which point guillotine detonates destroying both himself and giant robot the threat to earth has been eliminated but at the cost of earth s greatest protector weapons and functions the giant robot has numerous weapons systems which johnny can command the robot use finger missiles fired from the fingers with an undetermined number of rounds back missile fired from the back of the robot as the robot is lying on its chest facing toward its enemy the back missile is considerably larger and more destructive than the finger missiles bazooka cannon a weapon which fires out of the top of the robot s head not so much a bazooka as a shower of sparks capable of blinding and disorienting an enemy eye beams a twinned energy blast from the eyes the center v on the chest can launch and ram against the enemy to force it back in addition the robot s belt buckle contains a long pole which can be used to hook onto an enemy as a security precaution in case johnny is forced to give unwanted orders the boy can give a seeming line of gibberish into the communicator before doing so od ton yebo redro claiming it is a communication test however the robot is programmed to play the message backwards as do not obey order with that message the robot is programmed to take it as a signal that his controller is captured and regardless of any subsequent order the robot will launch and trace the signal to rescue his controller what s robo saying it s generally known that giant robo doesn t speak but every time daisaku gives him a command he responds with an echoing roaring masshhhh in the ova it lets out an echoing aoooooohhhhhhhmmmm the us version the entire series was first broadcast in the united states in 1969 and became quite popular in the next few years particularly during the 1971 to 1973 period when it reached its peak in distribution and popularity in 1970 several episodes were edited together to create the movie voyage into space which has now reached cult film status while recently released on dvd by toei video in japan the entire series had also been available on laserdisc during the 1990s the 26 episode series and the movie have never been officially released in the united states with the exception of the first eight episodes which were released on videocassette by orion home video following orion s folding into mgm and mgm s purchase by sony of america the american rights to the series are now in the hands of sony however bootleg copies of the entire u s version of the series have long been available on both vhs and dvd the american version of the series was astonishingly violent by the standards of childrens programming in the 1960s and would certainly never pass muster today guns and shooting are staples of every episode of the series and the series two child leads johnny sokko and mari hanson mari hanamura in the japanese version a 9 year old girl introduced in the seventh episode who speaks 39 languages and is a crack shot with a firearm were frequently seen shooting along with the rest of the unicorn agents in one episode johnny and mari are captured by gargoyle tied to two trees and are within seconds of being executed by firing squad when unicorn agents rescue them oddly enough though practically every japanese anime exported to the united states during that period was edited due to violent content johnny sokko and his flying robot seems to have escaped close scrutiny in that regard and what editing was done on the show seems to have been more for the purposes of squeezing in another commercial or two rather than in the interest of curbing the show s violence it should be noted that in addition to dubbing american voice actors for the u s release many of the show s sound effects were also remixed or re recorded entirely and though the show s japanese musical soundtrack was often used it was frequently used in different places from the japanese version of the series or replaced altogether by a jazz influenced score catherine byers aka bobbie byers who provided johnny sokko s english language voice has had a lengthy career since the 1960s she is also known for having voiced captain bonnie bokko on the english language version of the amazing 3 as well as prince planet on the series of the same name she appeared on camera in two 1960s biker films 1967 s wild rebels and 1968 s savages from hell since then she has focused on voice acting primarily talking books and stage work her amazing 3 coworkers neil patrick paul brown kurt nagel and jerry burke also provided various voices on johnny sokko and his flying robot after giant robo mitsunobu kaneko who had played daisaku kusama johnny sokko in the original series died in 1997

ended after 1973 matasaburo tamba spider had played small roles in several movies prior to giant robo his only role of note following giant robo was as the villainous black shogun in the 1971 tv

colleagues began to develop the drives they were to be the perfect energy source non polluting and recyclable with this new revolution there came a heavy price dr franken von forglor transliterated as

in cooperation with commodore amiga in order to ease transfer of data between software products produced by different companies iff files do not have any common extension most files with iff extension are in fact ilbm files wrongly named so because they are most common iff files and most assume that they are the only type of iff files on many systems that produce iff files file extensions are not important structure an iff file is built up from chunks each chunk begins with what the spec calls a type id what the macintosh called an ostype and windows developers might call a fourcc this is followed by a 32 bit unsigned integer all integers in iff files structure are big endian specifying the size of the following data the chunk content in bytes because the spec includes explicit lengths for each chunk it is possible for a parser to skip over chunks which it either can t or doesn t care to process there are predefined group chunks with type ids form list and cat a form chunk is like a record structure containing a type id indicating the record type followed by nested chunks specifying the record fields a list is a factoring structure containing a series of prop property chunks plus nested group chunks to which those properties apply a cat is just a collection of nested chunks with no special semantics group chunks can contain other group chunks depending on the needs of the application group chunks like their simpler counterparts contain a length element skipping over a group can thus be done with a simple unix style relative seek operation chunks must begin on even file offsets as befits the origins of iff on the motorola 68000 processor which couldn t address quantities larger than a byte on odd addresses thus a chunk following an odd length chunk will be preceded by a pad byte the top level structure of an iff file consists of exactly one of the group chunks form list or cat each type of chunk typically has different internal structure that could be numerical data text or raw data it is also possible to include other iff files as if they are chunks note that they have the same structure four letters followed with length and some formats use this there are standard chunks that could be present in any iff file such as auth containing text with information about author of the file anno containing text with annotation usually name of the program that created the file name containing text with name of the work in the file vers containing file version c containing text with copyright information there are also chunks that are common among a number of formats such as cmap which holds color palette in ilbm anim and dr2d files pictures animations and vector pictures there are chunks that have common name but hold different data such as body which could store image in an ilbm file and sound in an 8svx file and finally there are chunks unique to their file type some programs that create iff files add to them chunks with their internal data these same files can later be read by other programs without any disruption because their parsers could skip uninteresting chunks which is a great advantage of iff and similar formats as a nestable descriptive file format there are architectural similaries to xml xml however is primarily a text format whereas all iff contains at least some binary data the length fields it is possible to mechanically convert iff to an xml equivalent however xml has additional features such as descriptive data and metadata attributes entities dtd s and schemas and navigational features xpath which

 id=8340321 title liz lemon nonfiltered 117 processed 115 dbindex 1480117 elizabeth liz lemon is a fictional character played by tina fey on the american television series 30 rock personal history in jack meets dennis liz stated that she was from somewhere called white haven possibly referring to white haven pennsylvania and dialogue in the episodes tracy does conan and jack meets dennis suggest she was born around november 1971 in college she studied theater tech she and jenna maroney knew each other well as early as 1996 and together dreamed of making it big they shared an apartment in a chicago neighborhood called little armenia and began the girlie show on second city at that time the show apparently starred both of them liz and jenna worked for years to turn the girlie show into a television series the pair of them even having to move from chicago to new york city for it liz became the head writer and apparently the unofficial show runner for the girlie show while jenna became the show s main star it is not known when the television version of the girlie show started but it was apparently after the year 2000 and the show had evidently run long enough to successfully find a fanbase by the time of the pilot episode liz and the writers apparently had a good relationship with their boss gary who was stated to love the show and be pleased with the ratings however gary s death is announced in the pilot and jack donaghy takes his place jack immediately decides to retool the show to make it appeal to a larger demographic starting by firing her trusted producer pete hornberger and making her hire unpredictable actor tracy jordan as the show s new star liz manages to convince jack to re hire pete but jack is insistent on making the show center around tracy and much to liz s chagrin he renames the show tgs with tracy jordan personality jack s overview liz lemon is presumably a parody of tina fey herself or possibly her media image in the pilot episode jack at a mere glance described her apparently accurately as a new york third wave feminist college educated single and pretending to be happy about it overscheduled undersexed you buy any magazine that says healthy body image on the cover and every two years you take up knitting for a week pete said that the knitting part in particular was uncanny physical appearance and typical attire in contrast with her friend and likely foil jenna maroney liz seems to have little interest in stereotypical female interests such as fashion her bi curious shoes led jack to erroneously think she was gay and set her up on a blind date with his friend gretchen thomas the brilliant plastics engineer lesbian in blind date except when she is pressured to dress more femininely she appears in unfashionable gender neutral attire due to this jack very clearly does not find her at all attractive as he repeatedly makes clear through backhanded compliments liz almost always appears wearing plastic rimmed glasses and the flashbacks from the episode blind date reveal that she has worn glasses since she was about four or five at least however according to jenna in the rural juror she does not actually need glasses this is probably intended to parody the fact that plastic rimmed glasses are considered to be tina fey s trademark in real life despite the fact that she does not actually need glasses except to see far away quirks and interests liz is generally portrayed as something of a geek so although apparently a skilled writer she seems to have precious few social skills as demonstrated in the break up where while she was trying to meet a date at a karaoke bar a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken and she asked him why she should move her coat just so he could sit there she is apparently a fan of star wars often using events from the original trilogy to explain her feelings and actions in daily life and heroes i like the japanese dude and her drink of choice is pinot grigio blind date the head and the hair she is allergic to dogs and has evidently won at least one emmy award liz also speaks fluent german liz has a strong aversion to unfairness and breaking rules as demonstrated in the opening scene of the pilot where when a man cheats to get a hot dog from a hot dog stand more quickly by creating a new line which several people from the original line promptly join she responds by buying all the hot dogs and giving them to the good people who stayed in the original line later when liz considered quitting over jack s changes to the show pete told her that she had the best job in new york and that she shouldn t in his words buy all the hot dogs she also seems to have a weakness when it comes to maternal instincts in the baby show the day after liz told jenna that she wanted to have children she found herself bombarded with offers from people who wanted to be sperm donors or surrogates for her liz was also asked by a makeup artist to hold her baby daughter while she was doing touch ups on jenna but after leaving jenna s dressing room liz blacked out and found herself standing in her apartment still holding the baby in her arms thanks to the baby s hypnotic effect on her political beliefs as demonstrated in several encounters with jack she seems to have left wing politics and is most likely a democrat in jack tor she is shown to be somewhat afflicted with white guilt which tracy uses to manipulate her in the episode she later says that her white guilt is to be used only for good like overtipping and supporting barack obama relationships jenna maroney liz stated in the pilot that she and jenna worked for years to get the girlie show and a series of flashbacks in the rural juror reveal that liz and jenna have known each other since at least 1996 having been roomates together in a chicago neighborhood called little armenia given jenna s uptight nature liz is generally forced to act as her rock this has caused liz some annoyance especially after jack increased jenna s stress level and paranoia by hiring tracy and changing the show s name liz has been seen complaining about jenna s erratic tendencies behind her back

donaghy though to his face she is generally respectful of his authority though she has dared to be rather sarcastic on a few occasions most notably when first meeting him in the pilot the degree of her dislike for him tends to vary from time to time like tracy he usually refers to her as lemon when addressing him she usually calls him sir though if he s being particularly intimate which he has tendency to be she has been known to call him by his first name when referring to him she has been shown to call by his first name last name or full name love life according to pete in blind date liz

 id=63452 title heuristic nonfiltered 126 processed 124 dbindex 1480126 a heuristic is a replicable method or approach for directing one s attention in learning discovery or problem solving it is originally derived from the greek heurisko which means i find a form of the same verb is found in archimedes famous exclamation eureka i have found the term was introduced in the 4th century ce by pappus of alexandria the study of heuristics is sometimes called heuristic but more often called heuristics heuristics in this sense is treated as a singular like physics or mathematics the mathematician george pólya popularized heuristics in the mid 20th century in his book how to solve it he learned mathematical proofs as a student but he did not know nor was he taught the ways mathematicians arrived at such proofs how to solve it is a collection of ideas about heuristics that he taught to mathematics students ways of looking at problems and formulating solutions how to solve it describes the following common and simple heuristics which serve as useful illustrative examples if you are having difficulty understanding a problem try drawing a picture if you can t find a solution try assuming that you have a solution and seeing what you can derive from that working backward if the problem is abstract try examining a concrete example try solving a more general problem first the inventor s paradox the more ambitious plan may have more chances of success the word is used adjectivally is it heuristic in relation to research or intellectual pursuits for example a good theory or idea may be heuristic in that it attempts to find something out or stimulates further investigation when criticizing theories in the sciences good theories tend to be heuristic psychology in psychology heuristics are simple efficient rules hard coded by evolutionary processes or learned which have been proposed to explain how people make decisions come to judgments and solve problems typically when facing complex problems or incomplete information these rules work well under most circumstances but in certain cases lead to systematic cognitive biases for instance people may tend to perceive more expensive beers as tasting better than inexpensive ones this finding holds true even when prices and brands are switched putting the high price on the normally relatively inexpensive brand is enough to lead subjects to perceive it as tasting better than the beer that is normally more expensive one might call this price implies quality bias cf veblen good much of the work of discovering heuristics in human decision makers was ignited by amos tversky and daniel kahneman who together had an important influence on behavioral finance critics led by gerd gigerenzer focus on how heuristics can be used to make judgments that are in principle accurate rather than producing cognitive biases heuristics that are fast and frugal theorized psychological heuristics well known anchoring and adjustment availability heuristic representativeness heuristic less well known affect heuristic contagion heuristic effort heuristic familiarity heuristic fluency heuristic gaze heuristic peak end rule recognition heuristic scarcity heuristic similarity heuristic simulation heuristic social proof take the best heuristic philosophy in philosophy especially in continental european philosophy the adjective heuristic or the designation heuristic device is used when an entity x exists to enable understanding of or knowledge concerning some other entity y a good example is a model which as it is never identical with what it models is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models stories metaphors etc can also be termed heuristic in that sense a classic example is the notion of utopia as described in plato s best known work the republic this means that the ideal city as depicted in the the republic is not given as something to be pursued or to present an orientation point for development rather it shows how things would have to be connected and how one thing would lead to another often with highly problematic results if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously law in legal theory especially in the theory of law and economics heuristics are used in the law when case by case analysis would be impractical for instance in the united states the legal drinking age is 21 because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of alcohol consumption however assuming people mature at different rates the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others in this case the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether one individual is mature enough that society can trust them with that kind of responsibility the same reasoning applies to patent law patents are justified on the grounds that inventors need to be protected in order to have incentive to invent it is therefore argued that in society s best interest inventors should be issued with a temporary government granted monopoly on their product so that they can recoup their investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period of time in the united states the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the application for patent was filed though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent however like the drinking age problem above the specific length of time would need to be different for every product in order to be efficient but a 20 year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent more recently some including lawrence lessig have argued that patents in different kinds of industries such as software patents should be protected for different lengths of time computer science in computer science a heuristic is a technique designed to solve a problem that ignores whether the solution can be proven to be correct but which usually produces a good solution or solves a simpler problem that contains or intersects with the solution of the more complex problem heuristics are intended to gain computational performance or conceptual simplicity potentially at the cost of accuracy or precision human computer interaction in human computer interaction heuristic evaluation is a usability testing technique devised by expert usability consultants in heuristic evaluation the user interface is reviewed by experts and its compliance to ten usability heuristics broadly stated characteristics of a good user interface is assessed and any violating aspects are recorded notes see also behavioral economics

child or adolescent sometimes also applied to childish adult men however the term is also used for a human regardless of age or sex sometimes even extended to more primitive humanoids than the present species homo sapiens as in apeman etymology the english term man from proto germanic mannaz man person and words derived therefrom can designate any or even all of the human race regardless of their gender or age this is indeed the oldest usage of man in english this derives from a proto indo european root man meaning hand a similar cognate is old norse mund hand the distinctive and dexterous hands of humans compared to those of other animals are the basis of this term and the similarly derived term manual from latin manus hand by hand age and terminology manhood is the period in a male s life after he has transitioned from boyhood at least physically during puberty many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a man s coming of age such as confirmation in some branches of christianity bar mitzvah in judaism or even just the celebration of the eighteenth or twenty first birthday as in most western societies a boy is a male human child for many the word man implies a certain degree of maturity and responsibility that young men in particular often feel unprepared for yet they may also feel too old to be called a boy for this reason many avoid using either man or boy to describe a young man and prefer colloquial terms such as bloke lad chap fellow guy or dude biology and gender humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in many characteristics many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability however most of these characteristic do have a role in sexual attraction most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height weight and body structure though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern for example men tend to be taller than women but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid height range for the species some examples of male secondary sexual characteristics in humans those acquired as boys become men or even later in life are deeper voice taller height facial hair or beard growth of pubic hair and hair under arms and on chest increased body size overall less subcutaneous fat increase in overall body hair coarser skin darker skin tone penis grows larger testicles grow larger and lower a higher level of androgenic hormones such as testosterone leading to increased muscle mass the sex organs of a man are part of the reproductive system consisting of the penis testicles vas deferens and the prostate gland the male reproductive system s function is to produce semen which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman since sperm that enters a woman s uterus and then fallopian tubes goes on to fertilize an egg which develops into a fetus or child the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the gestation the concept of fatherhood and family exists in human societies the study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology most but not all men have the karyotype 46 xy in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women however there are some sex related illnesses that occur only or more frequently in men for example autism and color blindness are more common in men than women as well some age related disorders such as alzheimer s disease appear to be more common among men though whether this is due to a genuinely higher incidence or because men have lower life expectancies than women is uncertain twenty percent of males particularly in the u s the philippines and south korea as well as jews and muslims from all countries have experienced circumcision a process of altering the penis from its natural state by removing the foreskin biological factors are not always sufficient determinants of whether a person considers themselves a man or is considered a man intersexed men may have physical features that are more common in women in addition female to male transgender or transsexual individuals are often considered men psychologically as well as in the social and legal senses varying by district and culture but are born with physiology that would be considered typicaly female sexual characteristics in humans the sex of an individual is generally determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell if a sperm cell carrying an x chromosome fertilizes the egg the offspring will typically be female xx if a sperm cell carrying a y chromosome fertilizes the egg the offspring will typically be male xy this is refered to as the xy sex determination system and is typical of most mammals but quite a few other sex determination systems exist including some that are non genetic the term primary sexual characteristics denotes the kind of gamete the gonad produces the ovary produces egg cells in the female and the testis produces sperm cells in the male the term secondary sexual characteristics denotes all other sexual distinctions that play indirect roles in uniting sperm and eggs secondary sexual characteristics include everything from the specialized male and female features of the genital tract to the brilliant plumage of male birds or facial hair of humans to behavioral features such as courtship generally the more highly evolved the species the more elaborate are its secondary sexual characteristics at the time the eggs of starfish ripen the male merely releases great quantities of sperm cells into the ocean water and a tiny but sufficient number of them find and penetrate distant eggs frogs and toads are drawn to mates by calls and they spawn in water the male makes cloacal contact with the female and releases sperm externally simultaneously with the eggs terrestrial animals especially mammals which do not have an environment of water through which sperm can propel itself rely on herding and flocking courtship competition among males and more specialized genitalia including an erectile penis sex hormones in mammals the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens mainly testosterone which stimulate later development of the ovary in the sexually undifferentiated embryo testosterone stimulates the development of the wolffian ducts the penis and closure of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum another significant hormone in sexual differeniation is the anti muellarian hormone which inhibits development of the müllerian ducts for males during puberty testosterone along with gonadotropins released by the pituitary gland stimulates spermatogenesis along with the full sexual distinction of a human male from a human female while women are acted upon by estrogens and progesterones to produce their sexual distinction from the human male gender stereotypes enormous debate in western societies has focused on perceived social intellectual or emotional differences between men and women these differences are very difficult to quantify for both scientific and political reasons below are a few stereotypical claims sometimes made about men in relation to women more aggressive than women however in interpersonal relationships most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive men do tend to be more aggressive outside of the home more courageous and adventuresome than women more competitive but also more stubborn than women more self confident even proud and exhibit better leadership skills than women more self controlled and less emotional more spacially intelligent than than women but less empathetic more prone to abstract thinking than women some of these differences have been supported by scientific research others have not for example in interpersonal relationships most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive men do tend to be more aggressive outside of the home it is especially difficult and contentious for science to separate the innate or biological differences from the learned or social differences all should be considered broad generalizations that is at least a large minority of either gender would fit better with the other gender in any one of these aspects a number of the above stereotypes were not perceived in the same way as today i e their applications to particular aspects and spheres of life such as work vs home until the 19th century beginning with industrialization in terms of outward appearance few men in western cultures wear cosmetics or clothing generally associated with female gender roles doing so is generally stigmatized and viewed as cross dressing it is claimed men on average have a higher iq than women of around five points culture and gender roles well into prehistoric culture men are believed to have assumed a variety of social and cultural roles which are likely similar across many groups of humans in hunter gatherer societies men were often if not exclusively responsible for all large game killed the capture and raising of most or all domesticated animals the building of permanent shelters the defense of villages and other tasks where the male physique and strong spatial cognition were most useful some anthropologists believe that it may have been men who led the neolithic revolution and became the first pre historical ranchers as a possible result of their intimate knowledge of animal life throughout history the roles of men have changed greatly as societies have moved away from agriculture as a primary source of jobs the emphasis on male physical ability has waned traditional gender roles for middle class men typically involved jobs emphasizing moderate to hard manual labor see blue collar worker often with no hope for increase in wage or position for poorer men among the working classes the need to support their families especially during periods of industrial change and economic decline forced them to stay in dangerous jobs working long arduous hours often without retirement many industrialized countries have seen a shift to jobs which are less physically demanding with a general reduction in the percentage of manual labor needed in the work force see white collar worker the male goal in these circumstances is often of pursuing a quality education and securing a dependable often office environment source of income the men s movement is in part a struggle for the recognition of equality of opportunity with women and for equal rights irrespective of gender even if special relations and conditions are willingly incurred under the form of partnership involved in marriage the difficulties of obtaining this recognition are due to the habits and customs recent history has produced through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement in recent decades men in some societies now face women who receive educational and workplace benefit based solely on gender modern men in western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as on the topics of education violence health care politics and fatherhood to name a few research has identified anti male sexism and the effects of its expansion may increase hardships for many males gallery references further reading andrew perchuk simon watney

littlefoot littlefoot is an apatosaurus but is called a longneck in the films he is the central character of the film the land before time and its sequels he is close friends to five other baby prehistoric animals cera ducky spike petrie and chomper littlefoot s having friends outside his species is a taboo as many of the dinosaurs practice racial or species based segregation his grandparents accept his friendships but other dinosaurs such as topsy cera s father do not littlefoot s primary caregiver is his grandparents as his mother was killed in the original film and his father bron was separated from him and his mother shortly before littlefoot s birth littlefoot later found his father in the land before time x the great longneck migration and met his foster brother shorty bron offered to let littlefoot stay with him but littlefoot declined staying with his friends and grandparents in the great valley cera cera is a triceratops and a friend of littlefoot cera is a bossy dinosaur who tries to show no fear she has no problem bragging about her accomplishments but will run away at the first sign of any real danger she is very sweet and caring but that side of her personality is usually masked by her normally gruff exterior cera s father topsy is seen in every film in the series except the land before time iv journey through the mists but her mother was only seen in background shots of the original the land before time in the land before time xi invasion of the tinysauruses cera s dad was in love with his new girlfriend tria and had his name revealed cera has a brother and sister who were seen briefly in the land before time and has a nephew and a niece dana and dinah strangly these two dino toddlers have tiny bony stubs on there foreheads wich are clearly small horns cera however even though she is older then them has yet to acquire horns on her head dinah and dana made their appearances and were seen in the land before time vi the secret of saurus rock in the land before time ii the great valley adventure her design was slightly modified to make her look older and more appealing her head and face is now less round and more angular but her body design remains true to the original film ducky ducky is a saurolophus which is also called a big mouth or a swimmer she tends to say yep yep yep quite a lot which is frequently quoted today in popular culture and everyday life ducky s personality compared to the others is very caring and at times somewhat childish although she is sensitive to others feelings she can be easily manipulated to believe that some things may be right when in fact they might lead to trouble this is shown in the first the land before time movie when cera convinced her that a certain route to the great valley was easier than the way up a mountain of loose rocks this in fact lead to danger as she and spike ended up lost petrie petrie is a pterosaur and is also called a flyer a pteranodon to be exact petrie has a family which are a mom voiced by tress macneille and a bunch of brothers and sisters he was originally afraid of flying until a tangle with the original sharptooth gave him the courage and breath to save his friends he used to idolize his uncle pterano thinking he can do no wrong later he finds out that pterano is as insecure as petrie is it is ironic how alike pterano and petrie are not just in looks but in personality he seems to have a strong friendship with ducky spike spike is as his name implies a spike tail stegosaurus he is one of the youngest members of the group chomper being the only major character younger than him in fact littlefoot ducky and petrie witnessed his hatching and ducky s mother adopted him upon reaching the great valley as his family has yet to be seen a stegosaur family did however offer to take him with them although he decided to stay with ducky and his family he is known for his large appetite and can often be seen chasing after some piece of food a bush leaves exc he is also portrayed as mute although later films like the land before time vii the stone of cold fire or the land before time xi invasion of the tinysauruses show that he can speak perfectly well he simply chooses not too chomper chomper is a tyrannosaurus which is known as a sharptooth in the land before time movies he is bilingual being able to speak both the herbivore language of littlefoot and his friends heard as english to the viewer and the sharptooth language of tyrannosaurus which seems to consist of grunts roars and clicks littlefoot and his friends originally found chomper as an egg and took care of him as surrogate parents until he was found by his real parents he left the great valley with them and was not seen again until the land before time v the mysterious island where he was living on an island with his parents now that the landbridge which connected the island to the mainland has been destroyed he and his parents cannot get off the island however in the tv series which appears to be after land before time xi he is shown still in the great valley but without his parents chomper is portrayed by rob paulsen in the land before time ii cannon young in the land before time v and max burkholder in the tv series ruby ruby is a new friend of littlefoot and his friends and appears in the television series she is a female oviraptor parents foster parents relatives and adoptees bron bron is littlefoot s father he was separated from littlefoot his mother and grandpa and grandma longneck shortly before littlefoot s birth until the land before time x the great longneck migration bron was unsure of his wife and son s fates bron also has an adopted son named shorty in part x littlefoot and his grandparents get a sudden urge to migrate to an unknown place and when they arrive they find hundreds of other longnecks one of them was bron who recognizes grandpa longneck and littlefoot meets his father for the first time littlefoot didn t take this very well however he thought bron had abandoned him and his mother and he retreated into seclusion bron caught up with him and explains how they had gotten separated littlefoot accepts this and the two bond much to the displeasure of shorty littlefoot s foster brother shorty and littlefoot made amends however when they were forced to work together to save themselves from attacking sharpteeth it is unkown if ali s mother is his or his wife s sister cera s brothers and sisters chomper s parents they only appeared in the land before time ii the great valley adventure and the land before time v the mysterious island they are both green in color but the mother and father are distinguished by exact shade with the father being much darker this may reflect a gender or racial difference although they are ferocious predators like the other sharpteeth they are also devoted parents it is suggested in the series that they hired ruby as some sort of babysitter for chomper both ruby and chomper were separated from their family by redclaw and his minions and so far they have yet to reunite dinah and dana dinah and dana are little triceratops twins they are cera s niece and nephew they first appeared in the land before time vi the secret of saurus rock and have not been seen since the further sequels ducky and spike s father he is rarly seen but has apeared when at the nest or in the back ground like in the land before time viii the big freeze but he still lives ducky and spike s mother ducky and spike s mother is a saurolophus and has appeared in most of the 11 movies that have debuted so far more than littlefoot s mother was she is blind to race as seen in her inter racial species adoption of spike a stegosaurus she loves all her children ducky and spike have other nestmates and is very attentive she is popular among littlefoot and his friends for these reasons and is treated with respect both by littlefoot and his friends as well as the adults in the great valley she occasionally has doubts on how to raise spike whether in keeping with her own values or with spike tail customs this was seen in the land before time viii the big freeze when a stegosaur herd met and befriended spike she even let him go with the herd to learn his kind s ways however when spike fell through ice it was she who rescued her grateful son this is also scientifically accurate as at least some hadrosaurids such as maiasaura or good mother lizard are believed to have been attentive parents curiously her son is shown as being able to walk and even talk soon after hatching unlike other young dinosaurs in the film while the evidence for hadrosaur parental care rests in the fact that young were unable to care for themselves ducky and spike s brothers and sisters ther are at least 14 of ther brothers and sisters grandpa and grandma longneck grandpa and grandma longneck are littlefoot s grandparents and his primary caregivers after his mother died they act as parents to littlefoot giving him advice when needed and take their responsibility of protecting littlefoot very seriously when in part vi littlefoot called doc the greatest his grandfather was visibly hurt their real names have yet to be revealed as most everyone calls them grandpa and grandma topsy calls littlefoot s grandfather longneck and bron littlefoot s father calls him poppa longneck they also provide a voice of reason in the great valley trying to make peace between the dinosaurs when times become hard detailed analysis of the film series shows that littlefoot s grandfather has assumed a leadership position among the dinosaurs of the valley welcoming visitors and newcomers the land before time iv journey through the mists and the land before time vi the secret of saurus rock passing judgement on criminals the land before time vii the stone of cold fire deciding a course of action for the herds of the valley the land before time v the mysterious island managing natural resources such as water the land before time v the mysterious island and providing for the common defense in times of danger the land before time ii the great valley adventure grandpa longneck is also shown to be a very loving husband to his wife a song from part iv indicates that marriage does exist in the land before time universe and a kindly grandfather figure not only to littlefoot but to all the young dinosaurs of the valley he in fact has been known to tell children stories around the campfire or lavapool it can also be assumed that he was good father to his late daughter littlefoot s mother he also gets along well with bron his son in law however while is mostly free of the bigotry that characterizes some other dinosaurs he has a prejudiced view of sharptooth dinosaurs he sees them as not very bright however with how one killed his daughter it is a a less severe condemnation than that of his son in law who despises them as cowards as seen in part v after being separated from littlefoot his grandparents gave up hope of ever seeing either him of their daughter again and went searching for the valley on the way they met other dinosaurs who joined their search for the valley as well not unlike how their children also found and joined each other it is likely at this time that he was formally introduced to topsy and assumed the leadership of the combined herds as of the moment grandpa and grandma longneck live happily in the great valley though they occasionally meet with relatives as in the part iv or leave to meet with other longnecks as in part x grandpa longneck has been shown to be rather undecided in his beliefs this is quite unlike his daughter who stated that somethings you see with your heart and whose ghost in the first films shows that the supernatural does indeed exist in the secret of saurus rock he tells the children legends of heroic dinosaurs and of the mystical saurus rock that protects the valley but when asked which of the stories are really true he doesn t know however during the great longneck migration he just knows that he must go and that he must re enact the longneck creation myth grandpa and grandma longneck have appeared in all the land before time films littlefoot s mother appearing only in the original the land before time littlefoot s mother was shown a very loving mother to her only son however as the broken eggs in her nest show it is more precise to say that littlefoot was her only surviving son she got along well with her parents and loved her husband bron very much naming their son after him littlefoot was bron s nickname as a child she also led the herd in search of the great valley at the time of her son s birth the land was suffering geologic and ecologic upheavels that included but were limited to drought flooding famine predation and earthquake determined that her son not grow up in such an environment she led her herd in search of the great valley a wonderful beautiful place with green food more than you could ever eat and with more fresh cool water than you could ever drink she had no proof that the great valley even existed but she was guided by her knowledge that somethings you see with your heart she woke up and saw her son was gone she heard his and cera s scream s and arived just in time how ever after a huge battle having the sharptooth jump on her back and bite into her and being bashed agenst a rock she thought she had achieved victorie but she had to save the children once more finally pushing the sharptooth down the ledge unfortunately her atempt left her to die with her last breath she told her son to search for the great valley and that she would be with him her ghost would appear to her son in times of need and aid him in the quest for the great valley her last appearance was at the end of the first film when littlefoot despaired of ever finding the great valley and she or her ghost took to the form of a longneck cloud to guide him into the great valley where on a beam of light came from her heart the light shone on littlefoot and spread to illuminate the great valley below though long since dead she is periodically mentioned through the film series and she may have made an appearance in the land before time v the mysterious island littlefoot remembers his mother and looks at a star shining brighter than the others she also made an appearance in a flashback in the land before time x the great longneck migration from her portryal and her family s memories of her she appears to have been a good person though she was not quite as enlightened as her son she acquiesced to species segregation not because she necessarily liked it but because it s always been that way like human parents who in real life seek to raise their children in racially homogenous sundown towns part of the reason that littlefoot s mother sought to raise him in the valley was because there will be many many longnecks for you to play with however the fact that she saved both littlefoot and cera and from sharptooth shows that she was willing to abandon racial taboos her true name is unknown she is often just called littlefoot s mother and sometimes mama longneck she is likely grandpa and grandma longneck s daughter as how her husband refers to the old one as poppa longneck instead of father it is unkown if ali s mother is her or bron s sister petrie s mother she is shown to have a big heart like her son she still loves her brother pterano even if he did all of those terrible things petrie s brothers and sisters they had brief appearances in the land before time the land before time v the mysterious island and the land before time vii the stone of cold fire they have a bigger part in the land before time xii the great day of the flyers they are voiced by jeff bennett who voices petrie nika futterman and susan blu pterano he is petrie s maternal uncle while idolized by his nephew he is not trusted by his sister petrie s mother nor by grandpa longneck and topsy that is seen in how after the combined herds joined under grandpa longneck in search of the great valley pterano promised them an easy way to the valley and due to his incompetent leadership blundered them into a sharptooth ambush they were never heard from again after reuniting with his sister in the great valley he along with his henchmen rinkus a pink flyer and sierra a brown flyer began searching for the stone of cold fire a comet which he thinks will grant him magic power he fails and winds up putting petrie and the other children in danger but saves them at the end for that grandpa longneck exiles pterano for a period of 5 cold times winters years pterano appears in the land before time vii the stone of cold fire and has not been seen since it was rumoured he would appear in the upcoming the land before time xii the great day of the flyers but michael york who provided pterano s voice has confirmed that he isn t appearing shorty a dark green brachiosaurus he appeared in the land before time x the great longneck migration in bron s backstory he was found wandering in the wilderness with eight or so orange brachiosaurus hatchlings since he was the eldest of the small herd he is shown in the flashback to be very protective of the hatchlings shorty along with the hatchlings followed bron in the crater shorty and littlefoot didn t get along well until near the end of the movie when littlefoot stopped him from leaving the crater by himself littlefoot proposed the two could be brothers which made shorty happier and less jealous of littlefoot in the end he gets on well with littlefoot s friends and bron finally adopts him after littlefoot tells bron to take care of shorty shorty is the young bully of the film since he had a nasty past and was the only one from that small herd that wasn t adopted until the end of the film he was antisocial mostly wandering by himself and picking on other young dinosaurs including littlefoot his name is ironic in that shorty is a playground insult but he is also shorter than littlefoot even though he is clearly older than him topsy topsy is a triceratops the father of cera for many films his true name was unknown and was credited as daddy topps in the first film and cera s dad in the first ten sequels to the film there has been some argument over whether or not topsy is his real name and not a petname given him by tria this is seen in how cera was visibly angered when ducky called him that even so it is assumed that topsy is indeed his real name his personality was unknown in the first film but he was shown to be guilty of racism or speciesism growling at littlefoot whom he sees as a bad influence on cera and telling him that threehorns never play with longnecks he was often portrayed as pompous self rightous and bigoted the degree of his pride and stubbornness was seen in the land before time iii the time of the great giving when he took cera straight into a forest fire rather than go with the other dinosaurs he is aware of his bad attitude but in the beginning at least he thought nothing of it saying that even if was thought mean he had a family to protect and he would do that by any means necessary in a song from the time of the great giving he says that was inculcated with this attitude by his own father who told him to stand and fight don t run away in recent films he has still been shown as stern and less understanding than grandpa longneck but his prejudice and bad attitude have drastically but gradually lessened through the many sequels there is also the question of where topsy s wife mate is indeed the last film the land before time xi invasion of the tinysauruses shows him happily seeing tria littlefoot was shown asking if she would be cera s new mother topsy s mate was shown near the start of the land before time as were their other children however when he and cera were reunited at the end of the film some of the other children were gone his wife as well as the other featured children disappearing afterwards as the result of an accidental retcon given the fatalistic attitude of the first film the narrator stated that sharpteeth stalked the herds waiting to seize any who strayed it is likely they died on the way to the great valley however as seen by the presence of topsy s grandchildren dinah and dana in the land before time vi the secret of saurus rock at least one of his children unnamed and likely from before cera s egg laying is alive after invasion of the tinysauruses topsy and tria have another daughter tricia in recent films he has been shown to be part of the great valley s leadership sharing power with littlefoot s grandfather though topsy and littlefoot s family met early in the first film it is assumed that he and grandpa longneck were formally introduced to each other and decided to assume shared leadership of the combined herds after they were separated from their children in the great earthquake this was shown in a flashback in the stone of cold fire topsy is portrayed by burke byrnes in the land before time and john ingle in all of the sequels except the land before time iv journey through the mists where he never made an appearance tria tria is a pink three horn triceratops she is kind loving and brave though her character may seem rather false and unconvincing at first it is revealed in the land before time xi invasion of the tinysauruses that she and topsy cera s dad met when they were younger and are reunited in the film much to the dismay of cera despite some false starts however tria and her new stepdaughter do manage to get along in the end unlike topsy tria immediately finds the tinysauruses cute when she comes across a wandering pair which is why she separates from him for a short time tria and topsy have a child in the land before time xii the great day of the flyers she is portrayed by camryn manheim in the sequels and jessica gee george in the tv series tricia tricia is a young light pink triceratops she is the daughter of tria and topsy and the half sister of cera her first appearance is in the land before time xii the great day of the flyers minor characters ali ali is an apatosaurus who bears a striking resemblance to littlefoot apart from her dark pink skin colour and light blue eyes she and her mother belong to a herd that was forced to leave their homeland due to flooding and excess rain this was likely the same changing of the land that was referred to in the first film with their old home turned from the valley of mists into the land of mists ali s herd led by the matriarch called the old one was forced to leave during migration ali s herd found the great valley and were welcomed by their cousins grandpa longneck s herd however grandpa longneck fell ill and ali and littlefoot left the great valley to search ali s old home for the fabled night flower that would heal littlefoot s ailing grandfather cera ducky petrie and spike soon followed them and met up with littlefoot and ali together the group found the night flowers and brought them to the great valley to heal grandpa longneck afterwards ali and her herd left the valley to continue their migration even though she and littlefoot would one day meet again however the narrator assures us that that is another story so far this statement has been ironic she has not appeared since in the further sequels like most dinosaurs outside of the great valley herd ali was wary of trusting dinosaurs outside of her species and on her part cera initially didn t trust ali but later learned to accept her and the two became friends fanfiction often has littlefoot and ali fall in love and marry as adults she appeared in the land before time iv journey through the mists in the land before time tv series ali returns with the herd she meets a new friend red when her herd and another met and joined together ali s mother archie archie was an old archelon and appeared in the land before time iv journey through the mists he may have been inspired by crusty the turtle a character who appeared on a 1989 animated series very similar to the land before time called dink the little dinosaur both characters were shown to live in caves and give advice to the main character an apatosaurus littlefoot dink and his multi species group of friends including a pteranadon petrie flapper and a hadrosaur or duck billed dinosaur ducky amber and scat big daddy the leader of the tinysauruses he is not only the voice of authority but he is over protective and thinks he is the biggest out of the tinysaurus herd he has been met with much derision from his daughters chatter doc doc is a wandering diplodocus longneck who goes where the road takes him he is shown to be very taciturn and not forthcoming in his past also the dinosaur filmography describes his voice as being as gravelly as a bone bed shortly after appearing in the great valley he saved littlefoot who quickly went on to idolize the wanderer littlefoot believed doc to be legendary lone dinosaur who saved the great valley long ago from the most terrible sharptooth he bases these assumptions on the fact that doc can do fancy tricks with his tail he s been to the great valley before he has a scar on his eye and he has a resemblance to saurus rock to a degree littlefoot places him above his own grandfather and defends him doc when he is accused of bringing bad luck to the valley towards the end doc and grandpa longneck work together to save littlefoot from an allosaurus and a tyrannosaurus littlefoot asks doc to stay in case the valley should ever need a hero but doc replies that the valley already has a hero and looks towards grandpa longneck doc appears in the land before time vi the secret of saurus rock prior to the land before time x the great longneck migration some fans asked if doc was in fact littlefoot s father elsie elsie is a kind plesiosaurus that littlefoot and friends met in the land before time v the mysterious island after trying to find food for the dislocated members of the great valley to keep the group together littlefoot and the others get marooned on an island where the vast ocean surronding it prevents the homesick littlefoot and gang from leaving for they had a fear of swimming sharpteeth their problem is eventually solved when elsie appears offering the kids a ride to the mainland they accept and they travel safely back to the other members of the great valley who have found enough food to last them until they could finally return to the great valley guido guido is a microraptor who appears in the land before time xii the great day of the flyers although rumoured to be multicoloured his feathers are in actuality presented in warm shades of green and yellow mostly jade and he has never seen another creature like himself he is more of a comic relief character than previous guest characters and he is voiced by rob paulsen hyp the leader of the trio of bullying dinosaurs in the land before time iii the time of the great giving who tried to cause trouble for littlefoot and his friends hyp along with his other friends mutt and nod has a bad attitude on the outside but he often hides his cowardliness to make him look braver or bigger eventually hyp and his friends lighten up and help littlefoot and his friends with helping their parents deal with a pack of sharpteeth and later some food to share with others the trio has not appeared since in the further sequels hyp s father an often grumpy dinosaur he yells at his son when he s concerned for his safety like his son his attitude may have an effect on others including topsy who realises the errors of his ways on raising his daughter cera after witnessing hyp s father telling off his son with the exact same words topsy used with cera i m your father and i know what s best for you hyp s father is not cowardly but he is not always angry he can also be kind to others as shown at the end of the film in v he can be seen when the dinosaurs are leaving the valley but he is blue lizzie lizzie was one of the tinysauruses littlefoot and friends met in invasion of the tinysauruses a daughter of big daddy she was fed up with her father s over protectiveness and distrust of littlefoot and his friends similar to cera s situation with her father topsy lizzie and cera quickly became friends and made amends with their fathers voiced by cree summer mo mo is a colourful ophthalmosaurus who first made his debut appearance in the land before time ix journey to big water he is incredibly playful especially with his mud brother littlefoot but his boisterous antics could try the patience of some including cera he is bilingual in that he can speak both littlefoot s herbivore and his native dolphin like languages which the dinosaurs don t understand mo tried to warn them about an approaching liopleurodon which the dinosaurs found funny rather than cautious so far he is the only character to appear as a notable cameo in the latest sequels in the land before time x the great longneck migration he is seen jumping out of the water during the adventuring musical number he can also be seen during the flip flap and fly music video for the upcoming the land before time xii the great day of the flyers mutt one of the bullying trio he is dim witted and more dependent on his friends because he is not so bright he is more of a coward than hyp or nod he is a muttaburrasaurus and his name is inspired by his latin species name mutt s father he can be seen briefly in the fight against the raptors and in the land before time viii the big freeze saying that after topsy slipped from his nest he slammed into his nose nod another of hyp s friends a nodosaurus old one she is the leader of the migrating apatosaurus in the land before time iv journey through the mists she is regarded by her herd as the wisest although some find her claims hard to believe littlefoot questions her views on whether retrieving the night flower from the land of mists is too dangerous for example pat an old but not always wise apatosaurus he offered to look after littlefoot s friends on their way to the crater in the land before time x the great longneck migration when they realise they cannot make the journey by themselves pat finally looks after them his leg was severely burned from erupting lava after telling the longneck creation myth to the gang but they help pat escape from possibly dying by helping him get up when they arrive at the crater he helps defend the other children against three sharpteeth at the end of the movie the children ask him to come with them to the great valley which he slowly accepts pat is shown to be a lonely traveller as he offers twice to look after littlefoot s friends takes a different route to the crater and does not travel with a sauropod herd he is gentle but because of his age he is physically weak he was voiced by james garner and has not appeared since in the further sequels rainbow faces red red is a apatosaurus who resembles littlefoot and has large eyes he was introduced in the land before time tv series when ali shows up in the great valley at first red boasts about himself and told ali stories about him protecting his herd and convinced her that they were real littlefoot cera ducky spike petrie chomper and ruby plan a scheme to convince ali that red has been making up all of the stories when chomper acts as a mean sharptooth and scares him away after red admits to making up the stories when the old one finds out he then becomes friends with the gang rooter rooter was an old armored dinosaur he made only one appearance in the original the land before time but was one of the more powerful characters from that film and his actions are still felt today after littlefoot was orphaned he was wandering and came across the taciturn and almost disagreeable rooter he angrily told littlefoot to stop crying but stopped when he learned that littlefoot s mother was dead he said now you pay attention to old rooter and told the young dinosaur that the great circle of life had begun but not everyone made it back together at the end counseling littlefoot through his grief he said that he d always miss his mother but that she would always be with him as long as he remembered the things she d taught him in a way you ll never be apart for you are still a part of each other when littlefoot said that his stomach hurt rooter said that too will go in time little fella only in time rooter was added to the film to help soften the emotional blow from the intense sharptooth attack and the scene depicting the death of littlefoot s mother though it was rooter s only appearance bron would later remember somebody telling him of what happened to his mother some mistake the dinosaur he mentioned to be rooter but bron also mentioned he heard no word about littlefoot from this dinosaur rooter s voice actor was also the narrator of the first film pat hingle rocky and dusty skitter sue a bright pink supersaurus she saved littlefoot from a crocodile by simply crushing its face in the land before time x the great longneck migration she wishes for a mate and once in the crater she finally finds an ultrasaurus a sauropod taller than herself sue is kind and gentle but her real personality remains a mystery because of her short amount of screen time she was voiced by bernadette peters mr thicknose mr thicknose a pachyrhinosaurus is or was a very respected individual in the great valley community and served as a teacher to the children of the valley however his pedagogy was that of being a know it all the adults of the valley would send him their children to receive a primary education they assumed that mr thicknose was indeed a polymath and could effectivily instruct their children however this changed during the big freeze when littlefoot proved that he saw snow when this happened mr thicknose was verbally attacked by the grownups for not warning them so they could store away their food before the snow got heavier broken hearted he walks away to near the pass to sit down and sulk he apparently sits for some time judging by the snow on him he then accompanies littlefoot and the others to the mysterious beyond where they have an accounter with a sharp tooth and find a hot spring with much food there they discover the truth that mr thicknose has never been to the mysterious beyond before and his knowldege comes not from primary sources that is his own research but rather from secondary sources stories from far walkers or migrating herds this should not diminish his position as a teacher however some of the best professors use secondary sources though he does remain in the great valley he has not been since the big freeze it is not known whether or not he resumed his teaching position he appeared in the film the land before time viii the big freeze and has been seen in the land before time tv series the land before time tv series his name reflects his species name which means thick nose lizard or thick nose reptile other dinosaurs have been known to have species names as surnames or family names such as mr clubtail curiously with how topsy and grandpa longneck call each other longneck and three horn this could mean that the two leaders of the great valley combined herds also have their species names as surnames as well hence mr topsy three horn tickles the mouselike tickles is the first mammal seen in the land before time film series sentient but mute he is of unknown species presumably a megazostrodon but may be unlikely and was named because he in ducky s words had tickly fuzzies all over him he appears in the land before time iv journey through the mists tinysauruses the tinysauruses are a small herd of kitten sized multicolored sauropods that made their debut in the land before time xi invasion of the tinysauruses their name is a portmanteau of tiny and sauruses unlike their slower relatives they are quite fast and are very lightweight and their small size is useful for crawling into small spaces in the film littlefoot accuses the tinysauruses for knocking down and stealing tree sweets from the tree sweet tree because of this the other dinosaurs are eventually fearful of these rather alien creatures and have a desire to kill them if they could when littlefoot befriends these creatures however they turn out to be more sentient than he imagined tippy a pink stegosaurus he is spike s playful companion during the stegosaur migration in the land before time viii the big freeze when a stegosaur herd moved into the great valley spike immediately became close friends with tippy unlike spike tippy is very vocal his catchphrase is fun fun fun he was voiced by jeremy suarez who later did the voice of koda in brother bear tippy has not appeared since tippy s mother villains ichy and dil ichy and dil were an ichthyornis and a crocodile perhaps a deinosuchus respectively though they thouroughly disliked each other i need you like i need a disease oh yeah well i need you like the sun needs to freeze they made a working partnership in which small but eagle eyed ichy would spot prey and near sighted but very big dill would move in for the kill they were first stalking prey in a large cave until they came across littlefoot and his friends they then followed them to ali s old home now the valley of mists and there in the rivers and waterways almost ate them before dil was chased off by an angry plesiosaur ichy was sent flying by a tree branch they appeared in the land before time iv journey through the mists ozzy and strut ozzy and strut are two struthiomimus brothers who entered the great valley in hopes of stealing eggs though the more relaxed strut had hoped to eat plants they were bumbling villains who wound up being chased out of the great valley by chomper s vengeful parents their first appearance was in the land before time ii the great valley adventure however that was not the first appearance of a struthiomimus or egg stealers as they are called the first was in the original the land before time where one tried to steal littlefoot as an egg also during that film s end credits a struthiomimus or egg stealer is shown creeping into the valley this may or may not be ozzy redclaw redclaw is a male tyrannosaurus who has a distinctive scar that that goes through his left eye he is the prominent antagonist in the tv series rinkus and sierra appearing only in the land before time vii the stone of cold fire they are originally friends of pterano but appear more sinister then their associate particularly sierra they assist in the kidnapping of ducky and attempt a treason on pterano it was believed that they were burned at the end of the land before time vii the stone of cold fire the internet movie database mistakes sierra to be in the land before time ix journey to big water rinkus and sierra were once announced to appear in the upcoming film the land before time xii the great day of the flyers but this decision was apparently dropped rinkus was voiced by rob paulsen who also voiced spike chomper mo and guido and sierra was voiced by jim cummings screech screech is one of the two velociraptor companions of redclaw sharptooth sharpteeth are carnivorous dinosaurs that are the film series main antagonists each film typically brings in a new sharptooth or two usually involving a conflict between either the two sharpteeth or the sharpteeth and the dinosaurs living in the great valley at the climax of the film sharpteeth live in the area known as the mysterious beyond the land outside of the great valley the great valley is surrounded by great mountains preventing sharpteeth from entering however in the event of a landslide as in the land before time ii the great valley adventure sharpteeth find a way in the characters have a one sided view of sharpteeth save for chomper who is a sharptooth himself some going as far as calling them unintelligent and dangerous throughout the series however some sharpteeth have proven to be kind chomper and his parents showed kindness to littlefoot and his friends in the land before time v the mysterious island although chomper s parents needed some persuasion swimming sharptooth in some of the films in which water was prominently featured most notably the land before time v the mysterious island the land before time ix journey to big water and the land before time xii the great day of the flyers swimming carnivores such as liopleurodon and sharks are called swimming sharpteeth mo and elsie are examples of creatures deemed swimming sharpteeth although the two of them are harmless even helping littlefoot and his friends endofarticle doc doc

plot on stardate 5843 7 the crew of the enterprise is struck with a deadly disease known as rigellian fever and heads to the remote planet holberg 917 g in search of the mineral ryetalyn to manufacture an antidote once there sensors detect humanoid life despite the reports that the planet is uninhabited captain kirk along with his first officer mr spock and chief medical officer dr mccoy beam down to the planet to investigate and are quickly attacked by a floating sentry robot the robot is called off by its master who steps forward and identifies himself as flint flint claims that the landing party is trespassing on private property and orders them to leave his planet immediately threatening to kill them if they do not comply kirk however will not accept flint s authority and calls mr scott on the enterprise to shoot a spread of phaser fire at their position if any harm comes to them such an attack would completely vaporize everything in the area at first flint thinks kirk is bluffing but he finally backs down and reluctantly talks with his uninvited guests mccoy informs flint about the disease that threatens the enterprise crew and about the urgent need for the minerals on the planet flint listens and compares the epidemic to bubonic plague in constantinople earth in the summer of 1334 flint allows the landing party two hours to gather the ryetalyn mineral and offers the services of his sentry robot m4 to find and gather the mineral for them meanwhile flint escorts the landing party back to his home they are amazed at flint s impressive collection of earth artifacts which includes original copies of shakespeare a gutenberg bible and lithographs by terra nullus of centaurus vii spock is puzzled when his tricorder scans reveal the impressive works are new recreations made with contemporary materials it is as if the original masters had returned to remake them the party is then floored by the appearance of flint s beautiful adopted daughter rayna who instantly takes a liking to spock spock is impressed with her incredible knowledge of advanced physics and the two discuss warp field density and its relationship to gravitational dynamics flint states that rayna s parents used to be in his employ but died in an accident he has proudly assessed rayna s knowledge to be the equivalent of 17 university art and science degrees kirk plays billiards with rayna then they dance while spock plays a waltz on the piano spock determines the waltz to be an unknown piece written by johannes brahms since the work seems to be written in his style and by his own hand back in flint s lab mccoy analyzes the ryetalyn gathered by m4 and discovers that it is contaminated with iridium rendering it inert and useless meanwhile kirk romances rayna but m4 appears and attacks him spock enters just in time and destroys the robot with his phaser flint rushes in and kirk confronts him about the attack flint excuses it as a simple misunderstanding explaining m4 interpreted kirk s advances toward rayna as hostile kirk forgives the incident and is rather relieved of m4 s demise but is shocked when flint quickly summons a replacement sentry kirk contacts the enterprise and asks lt uhura to check out flint s and rayna s identities she finds nothing except that holberg 917 g was purchased 30 years ago by a private investor named brack in the meantime spock using a surreptitious tricorder scan discovers that flint is over 6 000 years old with the materials almost ready rayna comes to kirk to say goodbye kirk is madly in love with her and begs her to come with him mccoy then informs them that the ryetalyn is now missing and a search begins spock follows the tricorder readings to a hidden chamber where they find other raynas who are apparently all androids flint arrives and kirk demands an explanation of what is going on flint confesses that he is immortal born on earth in mesopotamia in the year 3834 bc he was first a soldier and after falling in battle and later recovering he learned he could live forever as time went on he lived the lives of famous identities alexander the great leonardo davinci johannes brahms william shakespeare king solomon merlin methuselah reginald pollack of the late 20th century the painter sten from marcus ii and many others throughout history he explains his purpose for making rayna was to create a mate who would never grow old and live forever just as he can horrified kirk believes it s time to leave but flint refuses to let them go since they have learned his secret he also claims that kirk has taught rayna something he has never been able to true love he now wants kirk to direct rayna s love toward himself kirk refuses to give into flint s demands and contacts the enterprise to beam them up and prepare to leave orbit flint then activates a device that teleports the enterprise to the planet miniaturized to the size of a desktop model with the crew in a state of suspended animation as seen by a giant kirk peering through the viewscreen flint is quickly shamed into restoring the ship but when he realizes rayna will not turn her love to him flint attacks kirk and a brawl ensues rayna tries to stop the fight and her feelings are torn in a logic loop between the two men this causes the android s circuits to overload and she collapses dead on the floor flint and kirk stop fighting and the two grief stricken men mourn over rayna s body both men are devastated but flint regains his composure and allows kirk to leave with the supply of ryetalyn back on the enterprise mccoy discovers from his readings that flint is dying only the complex fields of earth were keeping him alive but his life off world is now aging him normally kirk remains distraught over rayna which is affecting his ability to command spock uses a vulcan mind meld to help the captain either to forget rayna or at least to forget the pain uttering the word forget kirk is then able to return to his duties trivia methuselah is the longest lived man mentioned in the bible genesis 5 27 reads and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died it is believed that spock

 id=23964 title playstation nonfiltered 221 processed 219 dbindex 1480221 the is a video game console of the fifth generation first produced by sony computer entertainment in the mid 1990s the original playstation was the first of the notorious playstation series of console and hand held game devices which has included successor machines including the net yaroze psone a smaller version of the original pocketstation playstation 2 a revised slimline ps2 playstation portable psx japan only and playstation 3 by march 2005 the playstation psone had shipped a total of over 100 49 million units becoming the first home console to ever reach the 100 million mark history the first conceptions of the playstation date back to 1986 nintendo had been attempting to work with disk technology since the famicom but the medium had problems its rewritable magnetic nature could be easily erased thus leading to a lack of durability and the disks were a piracy danger consequently when details of cdrom xa an extension of the cd rom format that combines compressed audio visual and computer data allowing all to be accessed simultaneously came out nintendo was interested cdrom xa was being simultaneously developed by sony and philips nintendo approached sony to develop a cd rom add on tentatively titled the snes cd a contract was struck and work began nintendo s choice of sony was due to a prior dealing ken kutaragi the person who would later be dubbed the father of playstation was the individual who had sold nintendo on using the sony spc 700 processor for use as the 8 channel adpcm sound synthesis set in the super famicom snes console through an impressive demonstration of the processor s capabilities sony also planned to develop another nintendo compatible sony branded console but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both super nintendo cartridges and a new cd format which sony would design this was also to be the format used in snes cd discs giving a large degree of control to sony despite nintendo s leading position in the video gaming market in 1989 the snes cd was to be announced at the june ces however when hiroshi yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between sony and nintendo he realized that the earlier agreement essentially handed sony complete control over any and all titles written on the snescd rom format yamauchi was furious deeming the contract totally unacceptable he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint nintendo sony snes cd attachment indeed instead of announcing their partnership at 9 am the day of the ces nintendo chairman howard lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that they were now allied with philips and were planning on abandoning all the previous work nintendo and sony had accomplished lincoln and minoru arakawa had unbeknownst to sony flown to philips headquarters in europe and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature one that would give nintendo total control over its licenses on philips machines the 9am ces announcement was a complete shock not only was it a complete surprise to the show goers sony had only just the previous night been optimistically showing off the joint project under the play station brand but it was seen by many in the japanese business community as a massive betrayal a japanese company snubbing another japan based company in favor of a european one was considered absolutely unthinkable in japanese business after the collapse of the joint project sony considered halting their research but ultimately the company decided to use what they had developed so far and make it into a complete stand alone console this led to nintendo filing a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted in u s federal court to obtain an injunction against the release of the play station on the grounds that nintendo owned the name the federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction thus in october 1991 the first incarnation of the new sony playstation was revealed it is theorized that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced by the end of 1992 sony and nintendo reached a deal whereby the sony play station would still have a port for snes games but nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games and the snes would continue to use the sony designed audio chip however at this point sony realized that the snes technology was getting long in the tooth and the next generation of console gaming was around the corner work began in early 1993 on reworking the play station concept to target a new generation of hardware and software as part of this process the snes cartridge port was dropped the space between the names was removed and the playstation was born launch the playstation was launched in japan on december 3 1994 the united states on september 9 1995 europe on september 29 1995 and asia pacific in november 1995 in america sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre including battle arena toshinden twisted metal warhawk philosoma and ridge racer almost all of sony s and namco s launch titles went on to produce numerous sequels launch price in the american market us 299 00 a price point later used by its successor the playstation 2 the playstation was also able to generate interest with a unique slew of ad campaigns many of the ads released at the time of launch were full of ambiguous content which had many gamers rabidly debating their meanings the most well known launch ads include the enos lives campaign and the u r not e ads the e in u r not e was always colored in red to symbolize the word ready and the enos meant ready ninth of september the u s launch date the enos ad could also be read as sony written backward with phonetic sound of e replacing the y it is believed that these ads were an attempt to play off the gaming public s suspicion towards sony as an unknown untested entity in the video game market the playstation 3 slogan play b3yond resembles this slogan as the 3 is red titles well known titles on the playstation include crash bandicoot final fantasy vii gran turismo grand theft auto legacy of kain soul reaver metal gear solid parasite eve resident evil silent hill tony hawk pro skater spyro the dragon tekken tomb raider and wipeout the very last game for the system was fifa football 2005 as of may 18 2004 sony has shipped 100 million playstation and psone consoles throughout the world as of september 2006 7 902 software titles have been released worldwide counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles with cumulative software shipment of 961 million units the playstation logo was designed by manabu sakamoto who also designed the logo for sony s vaio computer products production run having lasted over 11 years the playstation has enjoyed one of the longest production runs in the videogame industry on march 23 2006 sony announced the end of production variants the first new version was actually a revision in early 1996 produced in response to complaints that playstations were overheating sony did not change the technical aspects or the cosmetics but did remove the rca ports left over from the japanese release the parallel port which was mostly unused by sony was also removed to reduce production costs sony also slightly improved the laser assembly many gamers experienced skipping full motion video or dreaded physical ticking noises coming from their playstations the problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments the plastic moldings inside the console would warp very slightly and create knock on effects with the laser assembly the solution was to ensure the console was sat on a surface which dissipated heat efficiently in a well vented area or raise the unit up slightly by propping something at its edges a common fix for already affected consoles was to turn the playstation sideways or upside down thereby using gravity to cancel the effects of the warped interior although some gamers smacked the lid of the playstation to make a game load or work sony then released a version dubbed dual shock which included a controller with 2 analog thumbsticks and a built in force feedback feature another version that was colored blue as opposed to regular console units that were grey in color was available to game developers and select press later versions of this were colored green on a technical level these units were almost identical to the retail units but had a different cd controller in them that did not require the region code found on all pressed disks since they were intended to be used with cd r media for debugging this also allowed the use of discs from different regions but this was not officially supported and different debug stations existed for each region the two different color cases were not cosmetic the original blue debug station dtl h100x dtl h110x contained revision b silicon the same as the early retail units these units had silicon errata that needed software workarounds the green units dtl h120x had rev c hardware as part of the required tests you had to test your title on both contrary to popular belief the ram was the same as the retail units at 2mb the firmware was nearly identical the only significant change was that debug printf s got sent to the serial port if the title didn t open it for communications this used a dtl h3050 serial cable the same as the one used for the yaroze a number of these units appeared on the secondary market at generally high prices and were popular because they would run games from any region and cd r copies which tended to result them in commanding high prices all the blue units tend to have cd problems but the dtl h110x units with an external psu block are significantly more reliable than the original dtl h100x ones a white version was also produced that had the ability to play vcds this was only sold in asia since that format never really caught on anywere else from a developer perspective the white psx could be treated exactly like any other ntsc j playstation the installation of a modchip allowed the playstation s capabilities to be expanded and several options were made available by the end of the system s life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to realize the modification of the console such a modification allowed the playing of games from other regions such as pal titles on a ntsc console or allowed the ability to play illicit copies of original games without restriction modchips allows the playing of games recorded on a regular cd rom this created a wave of games developed without official approval using free gnu compiler tools as well as the illegal reproduction of original discs with the introduction of such devices the console was very attractive to programmers and pirates alike individuals that insisted on creating copies of games that would play as their original counterparts faced many issues at the time as the discs that were produced by sony were designed to be difficult to copy and impossible to copy on recordable media not only did the original discs have a specific black tint to them they were mastered with a specific wobble in the leadin when amplified and sliced this contained a 4 character sequence that was checked by the cd rom drives mechacon chip and the drive would only accept the disk if it was correct this string varied depending on the region of the disk scei for ntsc j machines scea for ntsc u c machines scee for pal machines and scew for the net yaroze since the tracking pattern is pressed into the disc at the time of manufacture and cd rs have a clean spiral this cannot be reproduced on a cd rom recorder some companies notably datel did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodifed retail units but this was beyond the average pirate the other issue was that most pc drives used mode 1 or mode 2 form 1 2048 bytes sector and the psx used a mixed mode format with most data in mode 2 form 1 and streaming audio video data in mode 2 form 2 which a lot cd r drives at the time could not handle well even after accurate copies were made you still needed a modchip to send the correct code to the cd controller to enable the disc to be read if a disk failed the security checks it could be played as an audio cd but the cd controller would reject any attempt at data transfers from it the creation and mass production of these inexpensive modchips coupled with their ease of installation truly marked the beginning of console videogame piracy coincidentally cd rom burners were made available around this time before this the reproduction of copyrighted material for gaming consoles was restricted to either a people with exceptional ability or b access to very serious plastics manufacturing plants with this console joe public could replicate anything sony was producing for a mere fraction of the msrp net yaroze a version of the playstation called the net yaroze was also produced it was more expensive than the original playstation colored black instead of the usual gray and most importantly came with tools and instructions that allowed a user to be able to program playstation games and applications without the need for a full developer suite which cost many times the amount of a playstation and was only available to approved video game developers naturally the net yaroze lacked many of the features the full developer suite provided programmers were also limited by the 2 mb of total game space that net yaroze allowed that means the entire game had to be crammed into the 2 mb of system ram the user couldn t officially make actual game discs the amount of space may seem small but games like ridge racer ran entirely from the system ram except for the streamed music tracks it was unique in that it was the only officially retailed sony playstation with no regional lockout it would play games from any territory psone the psone also psone ps one or ps1 launched in 2000 is sony s smaller and redesigned version of its playstation video game console the psone is about one third smaller than the original playstation 38mm 193 mm 144 mm versus 45 mm 260 mm 185 mm it was released in july 7 2000 and went on to outsell all other consoles including sony s own brand new playstation 2 throughout the remainder of the year sony also released a small lcd screen and an adaptor to power the unit for use in cars the psone is fully compatible with all playstation software the playstation is now officially abbreviated as the ps1 or psone although many people still abbreviate it ps or psx there were three differences between the psone and the original the first one being cosmetic change to the console the second one was the home menu s graphical user interface and the third being added protection against the mod chip by changing the internal layout and making previous generation mod chip devices unusable the psone also lacks the original playstation s serial port which allowed multiple consoles to be hooked up for multi tv multiplayer the serial port could also be used for an external mod chip which may have been why it was removed although size constraints may also be to blame

is universally used as the ok button while the x button batsu wrong is used as the cancel one american and european releases have the x button as the ok button while the circle or the triangle buttons are used as the cancel ones however a few games such as squaresoft s vagrant story final fantasy vii and final fantasy tactics and konami s metal gear solid have the buttons remain in the same japanese configuration in their american and european releases these japanese button layouts still apply to newer playstation consoles such as the playstation portable psp and playstation 2 successors sony s successor to the playstation is the playstation 2 which is backward compatible with its predecessor in the sense that it can play almost every playstation game this was done by embedding the most important parts of the psone inside the playstation 2 design unlike emulators that run on the pc the playstation 2 actually contains the original playstation processor allowing games to run exactly as they do on the playstation for playstation 2 games this processor called the iop is used for input and output memory cards dvd drive network and hard drive like its predecessor the playstation 2 is based on hardware developed by sony themselves the next generation of the playstation is known as playstation 3 or ps3 and has been launched in november 2006 for north america and japan and will be launched on the 23rd march 2007 in europe sony has stated the ps3 will also be backward compatible with all games that were originally made for playstation 1 as well as the playstation 2 first party ps3 games will not be region locked but playstation 1 and 2 games will still only play on a ps3 console from the same territory the playstation portable officially psp is a handheld game console first released in late 2004 despite the name it is not compatible with playstation games it only runs games developed specifically for the psp on the umd format however at the playstation briefing conference on march 15 2006 in japan sony revealed plans for playstation 1 games to be downloaded and playable on the psp through emulation sony hopes to release nearly all playstation 1 games on a gradual basis however as of late december 2006 a custom firmware release allows users to play ps1 image files coverted into the psp s eboot format the success of the playstation is widely thought to have had some influence on the demise of the cartridge based home console while not the first system to utilize an optical disc format it was the first success story and ended up going head to head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges the nintendo 64 nintendo was very public about its skepticism toward using cds and dvds to store games citing longer load times and durability issues it was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with piracy given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue the success of sony s playstation introduced high quality sound and longer playing times as top priorities for modern gamers leaving little choice for competitors but to follow suit controversy to celebrate the ten year anniversary of the playstation in 2005 sony italy released an advertisement portraying a young man wearing a crown of thorns the thorns being made of triangle square circle and cross symbols the labels on the buttons of playstation controllers on his head the ad was captioned with dieci anni di passione in english this translates to ten years of passion the ad assumed to be a takeoff of mel gibson s controversial 2004 movie the passion of the christ was met with outrage from the vatican sony apologized and stopped displaying the ad quality of construction the laser in the cd player of early units was built into a plastic tray that slid back and forth on a set of metal tracks over time friction caused the plastic tray to wear out usually unevenly eventually the tray would become so worn that the laser no longer pointed directly at the cd and games would not load sony eventually fixed the problem by making the tray out of die cast metal a common but temporary fix to the laser problem was to tip the playstation on its side this made the tray hang perpendicular to the cd allowing the playstation to read the disc unfortunately friction would continue to wear down the plastic tray and eventually the playstation would not read the disc some units particularly the early 100x models would be unable to play fmv or music

 id=6869593 title wii homebrew nonfiltered 223 processed 221 dbindex 1480223 wii homebrew refers to the reuse of nintendo s wii game console hardware accessories and software for purposes outside of those intended by the manufacturer key objectives are to provide open source tools to expand or alter the capabilities provided out of the box at present good progress has been made on using the wii controller as a pointing device on other operating systems a long term goal is to run unsigned software on the console to allow homebrew games and applications to be used the support for adobe flash player in the supplied opera browser is being used to allow the development of games and applications which can be hosted within the browser environment this kind of software is very limited in its ability to interact directly with the wii hardware homebrew software one of the most important goals being worked on is the ability to run homebrew games and applications that are not licensed by nintendo due to the similarity between the wii and the nintendo gamecube hardware it is hoped that the bulk of the homebrew development tools used for the gamecube will be usable in the wii with little modification however the wii includes improved protection against the execution of unauthorised executable code and at present there is no identified method to bypass this protection it is currently possible to run gamecube homebrew on the wii by using an action replay disc and an sd memory card adaptor but the wii limits most of its hardware to the capabilities of the gamecube in this mode making it impossible to use the wii s advanced features one of the methods for running true wii homebrew would involve finding a way to deactivate these limitations bringing the wii out of gamecube mode the wii optical drive is very similar to that of the gamecube and is believed it may have similar flaws and backdoors the intention of nintendo to add support for standard dvds indicates it should be possible to persuade the wii software to read standard dvds to load programs and data on the gamecube this was a popular method for running homebrew software a published exploit in the current trial opera browser for the wii causes the system to crash by crafting a carefully formatted page to take advantage of the exploit it might be possible to run executable code on the wii however as the trial version of opera will be updated in the next couple of months it is expected this exploit will be corrected by the vendor linux on the wii as with many other platforms there is an effort to port the linux kernel and utilities to the wii as the wii includes 802 11b g hardware a pointing device the wii remote usb ports bluetooth an sd card slot and internal flash memory it is more amenable to the porting of linux than the older gamecube it is thus expected that linux on the wii will be more popular and find many more uses than gamecube linux as the wii is relatively cheap it could provide a very good platform for small servers media centers and for general integration of traditionally desktop computer based applications into a living room environment it is hoped that parts of gamecube linux will be directly reusable on the wii drivers will need to be developed for the extra features of the wii including the sd card slot and the wireless 802 11b g and bluetooth hardware a driver for the wii remote is also required and is already being developed for desktop linux to run linux the capability to run native executable code is required thus that issue must be addressed before development can proceed streaming media on wii the adobe flash support in the opera browser has been used to enable the wii to stream arbitrary content such as media files an example is a java daemon called wiisic which makes mp3 files on your pc available on your wii via a local url a more extensive solution has been developed called wiicr it acts as a streaming media server and is capable of transcoding nearly any video file for use with a flash player embedded in a local web page it allows browsing of the remote filesystem to view video images text files and play mp3s pc software titled orb from www orb com when installed on a capable pc can be used with the opera browser to stream many types of media as well as recorded tv from a pc to the wii this even works over an internet connection wii remote a number of features of the wii remote have been reverse engineered allowing the development of drivers for microsoft windows linux and mac osx the bluetooth hid driver is used to interface with the computer using a custom report format official avenues on 26th january 2007 nintendo told computer and video games magazine that they had developed a programming system that will allow small independent developers to make games for wii download service they declined to state the details of how this service would function sites and projects information on wii internals is still largely incomplete particularly the method the wii uses to validate and execute code as a result most of the effort to date has been the reuse of the wii remote with other operating systems rather than modifications to the console itself to date most of the various web sites serve to accumulate known information and link to third party accomplishments glovepie glove programmable

 id=335665 title history of poland 1569 1795 nonfiltered 246 processed 244 dbindex 1480246 the nihil novi act adopted by the polish diet in 1505 transferred all legislative power from the king to the diet this event marked the beginning of the period known as nobles democracy or nobles commonwealth rzeczpospolita szlachecka when the state was ruled by the free and equal polish nobility szlachta the lublin union of 1569 constituted the polish lithuanian commonwealth as an influential player in european politics and a vital cultural entity by the 18th century the nobles democracy gradually declined into anarchy making the once powerful commonwealth vulnerable to foreign influence eventually the country was partitioned by its neighbors and erased from the map in 1795 founding of the elective monarchy the death of sigismund ii augustus in 1572 was followed by a three year interregnum period during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system the lower nobility was now included in the selection process and the power of the monarch was further circumscribed in favor of the expanded noble class each king had to sign the so called henrician articles which were the basis of the political system of poland and pacta conventa which were various personal obligations of the chosen king from that point the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and constantly supervised by a group of senators once the jagiellons disappeared from the scene the fragile equilibrium of the commonwealth government began to go awry the constitutional reforms made the monarchy electoral in fact as well as name as more and more power went to the noble electors it also eroded from the government s center in its periodic opportunities to fill the throne the szlachta exhibited a preference for foreign candidates who would not found another strong dynasty this policy produced monarchs who were either totally ineffective or in constant debilitating conflict with the nobility furthermore aside from notable exceptions such as the able transylvanian stefan batory 1576 1586 the kings of alien origin were inclined to subordinate the interests of the commonwealth to those of their own country and ruling house henryk ii walezy 1572 1573 henry ii walezy was elected a king of the commonwealth in 1572 but shortly after at the death of his brother charles ix he fled poland and returned to france to be crowned as henry iii of france stefan batory 1576 1586 poland defeated russia s ivan the terrible and retrieved most of the lost provinces including livland at the end of his reign poland ruled two main baltic sea ports gda sk controlling the vistula river trade and riga controlling western dvina trade both cities were among the largest in the country during the livonian war 1558 1582 between ivan the terrible of russia and stefan batory of the polish lithuanian commonwealth the city was besieged by polish forces poland failed to capture the city but batory with his chancellor jan zamojski led the polish army in a brilliant decisive campaign and forced russia to return other territories and gained livonia and polock in 1582 the war ended with commonwealth victory with the peace treaty in jam zapolski stefan bathory planned a christian alliance against the islamic ottomans he proposed an anti ottoman alliance with russia which he considered a necessary step for his anti ottoman crusade however russia was on the way to the time of troubles so he could not find a partner there when stefan bathory died there was a one year interregnum emperor mathias s brother maximilian iii tried to claim title of king of poland but was defeated at byczyna in 1588 and sigismund iii vasa followed stefan bathory s reign house of vasa zygmunt iii waza 1587 1632 the first few years of sigismund s reign until 1598 saw poland and sweden united in a personal union that made the baltic sea an internal lake the polish swedish union however the rebellion in sweden started the chain of events that would involve commonwealth in more than a century of warfare with sweden in the end sigismund iii waza failed to strengthen the commonwealth nor to solve its internal problems instead he concentrated on a futile attempt to regain his former swedish throne polish sweden muscovy wars sigismund desire to reclaim the throne drove sigismund into prolonged military adventures waged against his native sweden under charles ix and later also russia in 1598 sigismund tried to defeat charles with a mixed army from sweden and poland but was defeated in the battle of stångebro the war continued punctuated by many ceasefires and broken peace treaties on occasion these campaigns brought poland to a nearly complete conquest of russia and the baltic coast during the time of troubles and false dimitris had it not been for the military burden imposed by the ongoing rivalry on multiple borders the ottoman empire the swedes and the russians the southern wars commonwealth ottomans relations were never too warm as the commonwealth viewed itself as the bulwark of the christendom and together with habsburgs and republic of venice was the thorn in the ottoman plans of european conquest since the second half of the 16th century polish ottomans relations never too friendly were further worsened by the escalation of cossacks tatars border warfare which turned the entire border region between the commonwealth and ottoman empire into a semi permanent warzone in the 1595 magnates of the polish lithuanian commonwealth intervened in the affairs of moldavia this would start a series of conflicts that would soon spread to transylvania wallachia and hungary when the commonwealth forces clashed with the forces backed by ottoman empire and occasionally habsburgs all competing for the domination over that region with the commonwealth engaged on its northern and eastern borders with near constant conflicts against sweden and muscovy its armies were spread thin finally the southern wars culminated in the polish defeat at the battle of cecora in 1620 eventually the commonwealth was forced to renounce all claims to moldavia transylvania wallachia and hungary religious and social tensions the population of poland lithuania was neither overwhelmingly roman catholic nor polish this circumstance resulted from the federation with lithuania where ethnic poles were a distinct minority in those days to be polish was much less an indication of ethnicity than of rank it was a designation largely reserved for the landed noble class which included members of polish and non polish origin alike generally speaking the ethnically non polish noble families of lithuania adopted the polish language and culture as a result in the eastern territories of the kingdom a polish aristocracy dominated over a peasantry whose great majority was neither polish nor catholic moreover the decades of peace brought huge colonization efforts to ukraine which heightened tensions between peasants jews and nobles the tensions were aggravated by the conflicts between orthodox and greek catholic churches following the union of brest and by several cossack uprisings on the west and north cities had big german minorities often of reformed belief w adys aw iv waza 1632 1648 wladislaw tried to achieve many military goals including conquest of russia sweden and turkey his reign is that of many small victories few of them bringing anything worthwhile to the commonwealth for a time he was elected a tsar but never had any control over russian territories in the end like his father he failed to strengthen the commonwealth or prevent the crippling events of the deluge or chmielnicki rebellion that devastated the commonwealth in 1648 jan kazimierz vasa 1648 1668 the reign of the last of vasas in the commonwealth would be dominated by the culmination in the war with sweden groundwork for which was laid down by the two previous vasa kings of the commonwealth in 1660 jan kazimierz would be forced to renounce his claims to the swedish throne and acknowledge swedish sovereignty over livonia and city of riga he abdicated on 16 september 1668 and returned to france where he joined the jesuit order and became an ordinary monk he died in 1672 chmielnicki uprising 1648 1654 this largest of all cossacks rebellions led by bohdan khmelnytsky proved disastrous for the commonwealth in the end commonwealth not only lost parts of its territory to russia but was weakened at the moment of invasion by sweden the deluge 1648 1667 although poland lithuania escaped the ravages of the thirty years war which ended in 1648 the ensuing two decades subjected the country to one of its severest trials this colorful but ruinous interval the stuff of legend and the popular historical novels of nobel laureate henryk sienkiewicz became known as the potop or deluge for the magnitude and suddenness of its hardships the emergency began with an uprising of cossacks in ukraine that culminated in a reassertion of an independent cossack nation centered in kyiv in spite of warsaw s efforts to subdue it by force after the cossacks concluded the treaty of pereyaslav with russia prolonged and increasing russian intervention began in the ukrainian and belarusian territories taking advantage of poland s preoccupation and weakness charles x of sweden rapidly overran much of the remaining territory of the commonwealth in the same year pushed to the brink of dissolution poland lithuania rallied to recover most of its losses from the swedes in exchange for breaking the alliance with sweden the ruler of ducal prussia was released from his vassalage and became a de facto independent sovereign while much of the polish protestant nobility went over to the side of the swedes swedish brutality and especially the ineffectual siege of jasna gora monastery in czestochowa in winter of 1655 1656 raised widespread revolts against charles whom a part of polish nobles had recognized as their ruler in the meantime under hetman stefan czarniecki the poles and lithuanians had driven the swedes from their territory by 1657 further complicated by dissenting nobles and wars with the ottoman turks the thirteen year struggle over control of ukraine ended in the truce of andrusovo in 1667 although russians had been ousted from wilno and lwow by 1662 the tsar gained eastern ukraine in the peace treaty despite the improbable survival of the commonwealth in the face of the potop one of the most dramatic instances of the poles knack for prevailing in adversity the episode inflicted irremediable damage and contributed heavily to the ultimate demise of the state when jan ii kazimierz abdicated in 1668 the population of the commonwealth had been nearly halved by war and disease war had destroyed the economic base of the cities and raised a religious fervor that ended poland s policy of religious tolerance henceforth the commonwealth would be on the strategic defensive facing hostile neighbors not until the polish soviet war of the early 20th century would poland compete with russia as a military equal commonwealth after the deluge in the treaty of oliwa in 1660 john ii of poland finally renounced his claims to the swedish crown which ended the feud between sweden and the commonwealth and the accompanying string of wars between those countries war against sigismund 1598 1599 polish swedish war 1600 1629 and the northern wars 1655 1660 after the treaty of andrusovo in 1667 and the eternal peace treaty of 1686 the commonwealth lost left bank ukraine to russia polish culture and the greek catholic church gradually advanced and by the 18th century the population of ducal prussia was a mixture of catholics and protestants and used both the german and polish languages the rest of poland and most of lithuania remained firmly roman catholic while ukraine and some parts of lithuania i e belarus were greek orthodox the society was split into a polonized upper stratum and peasants of other nationalities decay of the commonwealth during the 18th century the polish crown itself became subject to the manipulations of russia sweden the kingdom of prussia france and austria poland s weakness was exacerbated by an unworkable constitution which allowed each noble or gentry representative in the sejm to use his vetoing power to stop further parliamentary proceedings for the given session this greatly weakened the central authority of poland and paved the way for its destruction most accounts of polish history show the two centuries after the end of the jagiellon dynasty as a time of decline leading to foreign domination before another hundred years have elapsed poland lithuania had virtually ceased to function as a coherent and genuinely independent state the commonwealth s last martial triumph occurred in 1683 when king jan sobieski drove the turks from the gates of vienna with a heavy cavalry charge poland s important role in aiding the european alliance to roll back the ottoman empire was rewarded with some territory in podole by the treaty of karlowicz 1699 nonetheless this isolated success did little to mask the internal weakness and paralysis of the polish lithuanian political system for the next quarter century poland was often a pawn in russia s campaigns against other powers augustus ii of saxony who succeeded jan sobieski involved poland in peter the great s war with sweden incurring another round of occupation and devastation by the swedes between 1704 and 1710 in the eighteenth century the powers of the monarchy and the central administration became purely formal kings were denied permission to provide for the elementary requirements of defense and finance and aristocratic clans made treaties directly with foreign sovereigns attempts at reform were stymied by the determination of the szlachta to preserve their golden freedoms as well as the liberum veto because of the chaos sown by the veto provision under augustus iii 1733 63 only one of thirteen sejm sessions ran to an orderly adjournment unlike spain and sweden great powers that were allowed to settle peacefully into secondary status at the periphery of europe at the end of their time of glory poland endured its decline at the strategic crossroads of the continent lacking central leadership and impotent in foreign relations poland lithuania became a chattel of the ambitious kingdoms that surrounded it an immense but feeble buffer state during the reign of peter the great 1682 1725 the commonwealth fell under the dominance of russia and by the middle of the eighteenth century poland lithuania had been made a virtual protectorate of its eastern neighbor retaining only the theoretical right to self rule the polish succession war was fought from 1733 1735 michael korybut wisniowiecki king 1669 1673 following the abdication of king jan kazimierz vasa and the end of the deluge the polish nobility szlachta elected michael as king believing he would further the interests of the polish lithuanian commonwealth he was the first monarch of polish origin since the last of jagiellonian dynasty sigismund ii augustus died in 1572 michael was a son of a successful but controversial military commander jeremi micha wi niowiecki known for his actions during the chmielnicki uprising led by bohdan chmielnicki his reign was less than successful and the nobility was not satisfied with the house of vasa s dynastic policies despite his fathers military fame michael lost a war against the ottoman empire with turks occupying podolia he was unable to cope with his responsibilities and with the different quarreling factions within poland john iii sobieski king 1674 1696 john iii sobieski most famous achievement was to deal crushing defeat to the ottoman empire in 1683 at the battle of vienna which marked the final turning point in a 250 year struggle between the forces of christian europe and the islamic ottoman empire over the 16 years following the battle the so called great turkish war the turks would be permanently driven south of the danube river never to threaten central europe again augustus ii the strong wettin king 1697 1706 1709 1733 augustus ii the strong also known as frederick augustus i prince elector of saxony was an over ambitious ruler he defeated his biggest rival françois louis prince of conti supported by france and sobieski s son jakub to ensure his success for the crown of poland he decided to convert to roman catholicism from lutheranism augustus hoped to make the polish throne hereditary within his family and to use his resources as elector of saxony to impose some order on the chaotic polish lithuanian commonwealth however he was soon distracted from his internal reform projects by the possibility of external conquest he involved the commonwealth in the disastrous great northern war his attempts of internal reforms and strengthening the royal power came to nothing but his mistakes allowed russian empire to strengthen its influence over the polish lithuanian commonwealth stanislaw leszczynski king 1706 1709 1733 1736 seen as a puppet of sweden leszczynski ruled in times of turmoil and was soon cut off from the throne he emerged in the election of 1733 supported by france but after the military intervention of the russian army from which he was defending himself in gda sk he was forced to leave the country once again ruling successfully in lorraine august iii wettin king 1733 1763 also elector of saxony as frederick augustus ii august ii after his father s death inherited saxony and was elected king of poland with support of russian and austrian troops august ii was disinterested in the affairs of his polish dominion which he viewed mostly as a source of funds and resources for strengthening his power in saxony during his 30 year reign he spent less than 3 years in poland he delegated most of his powers and responsibilities to count heinrich bruhl 30 years of august ii disinterested reign festered the political anarchy and further weakened the polish lithuanian commonwealth while neighboring prussia austria and russia finalized plans for the partitions of poland the three partitions 1764 1795 during the reign of empress catherine the great 1762 1796 russia intensified its manipulation in polish affairs the kingdom of prussia and austria the other powers surrounding the republic also took advantage of internal religious and political bickering to divide up the country in three partition stages after two partitions the third one in 1795 eventually wiped poland lithuania from the map of europe stanis aw august poniatowski king 1764 1795 first partition in 1764 catherine dictated the election of her former favorite stanis aw august poniatowski as king of poland lithuania confounding expectations that he would be an obedient servant of his mistress stanislaw august encouraged the modernization of his realm s ramshackle political system and achieved a temporary moratorium on use of the individual veto in the sejm 1764 1766 this turnabout threatened to renew the strength of the monarchy and brought displeasure in the foreign capitals that preferred an inert pliable poland catherine being among the most displeased by poniatowski s independence encouraged religious dissension in poland lithuania s substantial eastern orthodox population which earlier in the eighteenth century had lost the rights enjoyed during the jagiellon dynasty under heavy russian pressure the sejm introduced orthodox and protestant equality in 1767 through the polish nobles that russia controlled and russian minister to warsaw prince nikolai repnin czarina catherine the great forced a constitution which undid the reforms of 1764 under stanislaw ii on poland in 1767 the liberum veto and all the old abuses of the last 1 1 4 centuries were guaranteed as unalterable parts of this new constitution poland was compelled to sign treaty of guarantee with russia where catharina was imposed as protector of polish political system since then poland has becomed de facto a russian protectorate real power in rzeczpospolita have russian ambassadors polish king becomed only an executor of their will this action provoked a catholic uprising by the confederation of bar a league of polish nobles that fought with russian intervention until 1772 to revoke catherine s mandate the defeat of the confederation of bar again left poland exposed to the ambitions of its neighbors although catherine initially opposed partition frederick the great of prussia profited from austria s threatening military position to the southwest by pressing a long standing proposal to carve territory from the commonwealth catherine persuaded that russia did not have the resources to continue its unilateral domination of poland agreed in 1772 russia prussia and austria forced terms of partition upon the helpless commonwealth under the pretext of restoring order in the anarchic conditions of the country national revival the first partition in 1772 did not directly threaten the stability of poland lithuania poland still retained extensive territory that included the polish heartlands in fact the shock of the annexations made clear the dangers of decay in government institutions creating a body of opinion favorable to reform along the lines of the european enlightenment king stanislaw august supported the progressive elements in the government and promoted the ideas of foreign political figures such as edmund burke and george washington at the same time polish intellectuals discussed enlightenment philosophers such as montesquieu and rousseau during the period of polish enlightenment the concept of democratic institutions for all classes was accepted in polish society education reform included establishment of the first ministry of education in europe taxation and the army underwent thorough reform and government again was centralized in the permanent council landholders emancipated large numbers of peasants although there was no official government decree polish cities in decline for many decades were revived by the influence of the industrial revolution especially in mining and textiles stanislaw august s process of renovation reached its climax on may 3 1791 when after three years of intense debate the four years sejm produced what is claimed as europe s first modern codified constitution conceived in the liberal spirit of the contemporaneous document in the united states the constitution recast poland lithuania as a hereditary monarchy and abolished many of the eccentricities and antiquated features of the old system the new constitution abolished the individual veto in parliament provided a separation of powers among the legislative executive and judicial branches of government and established people s sovereignty for the noble and bourgeois classes although never fully implemented the constitution of may 3 gained an honored position in the polish political heritage tradition marks the anniversary of its passage as the country s most important civic holiday destruction of poland lithuania passage of the constitution alarmed nobles who would lose considerable stature under the new order in autocratic states such as russia the democratic ideals of the constitution also threatened the existing order and the prospect of polish recovery threatened to end domination of polish affairs by its neighbors in 1792 domestic and foreign reactionaries combined to end the democratization process polish conservative factions formed the confederation of targowica and appealed for russian assistance in restoring the status quo catherine gladly used this opportunity enlisting prussian support she invaded poland under the pretext of defending poland s ancient liberties the irresolute stanislaw august capitulated defecting to the targowica faction arguing that poland had fallen prey to the radical jacobinism then at high tide in france russia and prussia abrogated the constitution of 3 may carried out a second partition of poland in 1793 and placed the remainder of the country under occupation by russian troops the second partition was far more injurious than the first russia received a vast area of eastern poland extending southward from its gains in the first partition nearly to the black sea to the west prussia received an area known as south prussia nearly twice the size of its first partition gains along the baltic as well as the port of gda sk thus poland s neighbors reduced the commonwealth to a rump state and plainly signaled their designs to abolish it altogether at their convenience in a gesture of defiance a general polish revolt broke out in 1794 under the leadership of tadeusz kosciuszko kosciuszko uprising a military officer who had rendered notable service in the american revolution kosciuszko s ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes but they eventually fell before the superior forces of russian general alexander suvorov in the wake of the insurrection of 1794 russia prussia and austria carried out the third and final partition of poland lithuania in 1795 erasing the commonwealth of two nations from the map and pledging never to let it return much of europe condemned the dismemberment as an international crime without historical parallel amid the distractions of the french revolution and its attendant wars however no state actively opposed the annexations in the long term the dissolution of poland lithuania upset the traditional european balance of power dramatically magnifying the influence of russia and paving the way for the germany that would emerge in the nineteenth century with prussia at its core for the poles the third partition began a period of continuous foreign rule that would endure well over a century see also polish

 id=1246115 title countersteering nonfiltered 247 processed 245 dbindex 1480247 countersteering is the name given to the counter intuitive technique used by cyclists and motorcyclists to turn corners it is the only way a rider can cause a single track vehicle at speed to turn it is important to distinguish between countersteering as a physical phenomenon and countersteering as a rider technique for initiating a turn the usual interpretation of the term the physical phenomenon always occurs because there is no other way to cause the bike and rider to lean short of some outside influence such as an opportune side wind although at low speeds it can be lost or hidden in the minute corrections made to maintain balance on the other hand the technique of applying pressure to the handlebars to initiate a turn is not always necessary since on a sufficiently light bike especially a bicycle turning can also be initiated by shifting body weight documented physical experimentation shows that on heavy bikes many motorcycles shifting body weight is ineffective at initiating turns how it works when riding a bicycle or a motorcycle countersteering is a method of initiating a turn by a small momentary turn of the front wheel usually via the handlebars in the opposite counter direction while necessary at all speeds the need to countersteer becomes more noticeable as speed increases a bike can negotiate a curve only when it leans towards the inside of the turn at an angle appropriate for the velocity and the sharpness of the turn otherwise centrifugal force will tip the bike and rider over towards the outside of the curve the transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn if a rider wants to turn to the right he first throws the bike off balance by momentarily pointing the front wheel slightly to the left the center of mass of the bike plus rider will continue in a straight line but the contact patches of the tires move to the left with respect to this straight line as gravity then tips the bike over to the right the front wheel is steered into the curve and the curve is negotiated with the proper inward lean this process usually requires little physical effort because the geometry of the steering system of most bikes is designed in such a way that the front wheel has a strong tendency to steer in the direction of a lean at low speeds countersteering is equally necessary but the countersteering is then so subtle that it drowns in the continuous corrections that are made in balancing the bike once in a turn countersteering is again required to make changes to its shape the only way to decrease the radius at the same speed is to increase the lean angle and the only way to increase the lean angle is again to momentarily steer opposite to the direction of the curve to the untrained this can be extremely counter intuitive to exit a turn countersteer by momentarily steering further in the direction of the turn this tilts the bike back upright countersteering is indispensable for bike steering most people are not consciously aware that they employ countersteering when riding their bike their body has learned to include the well timed countersteering jolt they may have learned to do so while learning to ride a bicycle in childhood often people simply assume that the steering of a bike is just like the steering of a car their subconscious balance skills know better as is well known in bicycle racing the countersteering phenomenon becomes evident when there is an obstacle preventing the wheel from countersteering e g when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to a curb in these situations the only way to initiate a turn away from the obstacle is to come into contact with it that is turn towards the wheel or curb in order to avoid crashing into it lack of understanding of this principle leads to accidents in novice bicycle races motorcycles even more so than on a bicycle mastering the technique of countersteering is essential for safe motorcycle riding and as a result is a large part of the safe riding courses run by the motorcycle safety foundation at the higher speeds that motorcycles commonly travel at it becomes increasingly impractical to steer by taking advantage of the minute and random corrections needed to maintain balance much of the art of motorcycle cornering is learning how to effectively push the grips into corners and how to maintain proper lean angles through the turn when the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an emergency it is essential to know through prior practice that the handlebars must be deliberately pressed away on that side instead of being pulled many accidents result when otherwise

 id=26195 title rna virus nonfiltered 260 processed 258 dbindex 1480260 an rna virus is a virus which belongs to either group iii group iv or group v of the baltimore classification system of classifying viruses as such they possess ribonucleic acid rna as their genetic material and do not replicate using a dna intermediate the nucleic acid is usually single stranded rna ssrna but can occasionally be double stranded rna dsrna notable human pathogenic rna viruses include sars influenza and hepatitis c viruses walter fiers university of ghent belgium was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene 1972 and of the viral genome of a virus bacteriophage ms2 rna 1976 characteristics rna sense rna viruses can be further classified according to the sense or polarity of their rna into negative sense and positive sense rna viruses positive sense viral rna is identical to viral mrna and thus can be immediately translated by the host cell negative sense viral rna is complementary to mrna and thus must be converted to positive sense rna by an rna polymerase before translation as such purified rna of a positive sense virus can directly cause infection though it may be less infectious than the whole virus particle purified rna of a negative sense virus is not infectious by itself as it needs to be transcribed into positive sense rna mutation rates rna viruses generally have very high mutation rates as they lack dna polymerases which can find and fix mistakes and are therefore unable to conduct dna repair of damaged genetic material dna viruses have considerably lower mutation rates due to the proof reading ability of dna polymerases within the host cell retroviruses integrate a dna intermediate of their rna genome into the host genome and therefore have a higher chance of correcting any mistakes in their genome thanks to the action of proof reading dna polymerases belonging to the host cell although rna usually mutates rapidly recent work found that the sars virus and related rna viruses contain a gene that mutates very slowly the gene in question has a complex three dimensional structure which is hypothesized to provide a chemical function necessary for viral propagation perhaps as a ribozyme if so most mutations would render it unfit for that purpose and would not propagate replication animal rna viruses can be placed into about four different groups depending on their mode of replication positive sense viruses have their genome directly utilized as if it were mrna producing a single protein which is modified by host and viral proteins to form the various proteins needed for replication one of these includes rna replicase which copies the viral rna to form a double stranded replicative form in turn this directs the formation of new virions negative sense viruses must have their genome copied by a rna polymerase or transcriptase to form positive sense rna this positive sense rna molecule acts as viral mrna which is translated into proteins by the host ribosomes the resultant protein goes on to direct the synthesis of new virions such as capsid proteins and rna replicase which is used to produce new negative sense rna molecules double stranded reoviruses contain up to a dozen different rna molecules which each code for a mrna these all associate with proteins to form a single large complex which is replicated using virally encoded replicase to form new virions retroviruses are single stranded but unlike other single stranded rna viruses they use dna intermediates to replicate reverse transcriptase a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself after it is uncoated converts the viral rna into a complementary strand of dna which is copied to produce a double stranded molecule of viral dna this dna goes on to direct the formation of new virions group iii dsrna viruses family birnaviridae family chrysoviridae family cystoviridae family hypoviridae family partitiviridae family

 id=2136 title angles nonfiltered 269 processed 267 dbindex 1480270 the angles is a modern english word for a germanic speaking people who took their name from the cultural ancestor of angeln a modern district located in schleswig germany ancient angeln preceded all modern national distinctions and was probably not coterminous with the modern for more information see under angeln evolution of the name the ethnic name has had various spellings the earliest attested is anglii a germanic tribe mentioned in the germania of tacitus it is an adjectival form one individual of this identity would be an anglius male or an anglia female which in the plural is anglii or angliae the masculine is used for the generic form the noun from which this adjective was produced remains unknown for certain the stem would have had the form ang l r etymology theories have been from latin angulus angle from the germanic god ingwaz and the ingvaeones federation of which the angles were part the initial vowel could as well be e or a it may refer to fishing by the method called angling the old english word for the district of angeln where the angles may have come from on the baltic is angel it may mean the people who dwell by the narrow water i e the schlei from the proto indo european language root ang meaning narrow pope gregory the great is the first known to have simplified anglii to angli the preferred form for the anglii in britain which he did in an epistle the country remained anglia in latin meanwhile english had changed its vowels alfred s orosius uses angelcynn kin for england or the english people bede angelfolc folk however we also find engel englan the people englaland and englisch early history angles under other names two important geographers strabo and pliny are silent concerning the angles they both use the excuse that the south shore of the baltic is terra incognita unknown land they both go on to describe that shore however as the angles took a geographic name they must have had others not based on geography the two silent geographers can help us with this question the knowledge of neither one of them predates tacitus by very long strabo s mention of the battle of teutoburg forest places his securely to the final years of augustus reign and after i e the early first century strabo 7 2 1 4 and 7 3 1 states that the cimbri still live on the peninsula jutland where they always did even though some of them liked to wander beyond the elbe the coastal people are unknown but south of them are the suebi from the elbe to the getae goths strabo was moving in his mind eastward from the rhine pliny on the other hand moved mentally from east to west 4 13 94 his description leaves the black sea crosses the ripaei mountains to the shore of the northern ocean and follows it westward to cadiz in this direction before germania is scythia where the sarmati venedi sciri and hirri are located as far as the vistula then the inguaeones begin baunonia bornholm is an island opposite scythia we arrive at cylipenus probably the bay of kiel and from there to another gulf lagnus which is on the frontier of the cimbri its location is not known but it must have been in the angeln region in pliny the inguaeones consisted of the cimbri and the teutones the chauci as well but they were not in this region if lagnus was on the cimbrian frontier and was after kiel then angeln must have been in the territory of the teutones they were perhaps not named angles at that time however the territory of the teutones probably included the propommern and the region south to the elbe mainly holstein accounting for the implied larger range of the people called angles in later sources the anglii of tacitus possibly the first instance of the angles in recorded history is in tacitus germania chapter 40 in which the anglii are mentioned in passing in a list of germanic tribes he gives no precise indication of their geographical position but states that together with six other tribes they worshipped a goddess named nerthus whose sanctuary was situated on an island in the ocean the other tribes are the reudigni aviones varini eudoses suarini and nuitones which are together described as being behind ramparts of rivers and woods that is inaccessible to attack as the eudoses are the jutes these names probably refer to localities in jutland or the baltic coast i e they are all cimbri or teutones the coast contains sufficient estuaries inlets rivers islands swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain such as the romans who just wrote it off as unknown and inaccessible country at the present time the majority of scholars believe that the anglii had lived from the beginning on the coasts of the baltic probably in the southern part of the jutish peninsula the evidence for this view is derived partly from english and danish traditions dealing with persons and events of the 4th century see below and partly from the fact that striking affinities to the cult of nerthus as described by tacitus are to be found in scandinavian especially swedish and danish religion investigations in this subject have rendered it very probable that the island of nerthus was sjælland zealand and it is further to be observed that the kings of wessex traced their ancestry ultimately to a certain scyld who is clearly to be identified with skiöldr the mythical founder of the danish royal family skiöldungar in english tradition this person is connected with scedeland pl i e scandinavia while in scandinavian tradition he is specially associated with the ancient royal residence at leire in sjælland the account in germania is contradictory to that of the silent geographers in at least one major point tacitus viewed the baltic as the suebian sea and lists the seven tribes above as being in suebian territory the suebi were among the herminones of central germany and yet pliny who is just as creditable accounts for the teutones as being inguaeones the ingaevones of tacitus in strabo the suebi are to the south of the coast the suebian language went on to become old high german while the angles and jutes were among the speakers of old saxon an explanation no doubt existed whether one of the authors misunderstood or the distribution of tribes in the 1st century resulted from an overlay of different historical schemes at this time there is no verifiable answer to the question and no good reason for forcing an answer by excluding evidence the suevi angili ptolemy in his geography 2 10 half a century later presents a somewhat more complex view as might have been expected the saxons are now around the lower elbe to which they could have gotten merely by an extension of the saxon alliance east of them we find not only the teutones but a dissimilation of them the teutonoari which has an oari suffix denoting men wer i e the teuton men these teutons or teuton men appear to have been in angeln and the land around it the angles as such are not listed at all instead we find some syeboi angeilloi latinized to suevi angili located south of the middle elbe owing to the uncertainty of this passage there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the angli one theory which however has little to recommend it is that they dwelt in the basin of the saale in the neighbourhood of the canton engilin from which region the lex angliorum et werinorum hoc est thuringorum is believed by many to have come a second solution is that these angles of ptolemy are not the ones of schleswig at all according to julius pokorny the angri in angrivarii the angr in hardanger and the angl in anglii all come from the same root meaning bend but in different senses in other words the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond germanic the suevi angeli would have been in lower saxony or near it and like ptolemy s suevi semnones were among the suebi at the time the angli of bede bede states that the angli before they came to great britain dwelt in a land called angulus and similar evidence is given by the historia brittonum king alfred the great and the chronicler æthelweard identified this place with the district that is now called angeln in the province of schleswig slesvig though it may then have been of greater extent and this identification agrees very well with the indications given by bede full confirmation is afforded by english and danish traditions relating to two kings named wermund and offa from whom the mercian royal family were descended and whose exploits are connected with angeln schleswig and rendsburg danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of schleswig father and son in their service frowinus freawine and wigo wig from whom the royal family of wessex claimed descent during the 5th century the angli invaded great britain after which time their name does not recure on the continent except in the title of the code mentioned above the province of schleswig has proved exceptionally rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries a d among the places where these have been found special mention should be made of the large cremation cemetery at borgstedterfeld between rendsburg and eckernförde which has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in heathen graves in england of still greater importance are the great deposits at thorsberg moor in angeln and nydam which contained large quantities of arms ornaments articles of clothing agricultural implements c and in the latter case even ships by the help of these discoveries we are able to reconstruct a fairly detailed picture of angle civilization in the age preceding the invasion of great britain angle influence in great britain according to sources such as the bede after the invasion of great britain the angles split up and founded the kingdoms of the nord angelnen northumbria ost angelnen east anglia and the mittlere angelnen mercia thanks to the major influence of the saxons the tribes were collectively called anglo saxons by the normans a region of england is still known as east anglia the center of the angle homeland in the north eastern portion of the modern german bundesland of schleswig holstein itself on the jutland peninsula is where the rest of that people stayed a small peninsular form still called angeln today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern flensburg on the flensburger fjord to the city of schleswig and then to maasholm on the schlei inlet in any case this small and relatively easterly geographic localisation of the original angeln tribal group has led to one of the anglo saxon invasion s enduring mysteries how it is possible that the anglo saxons were so frequently mentioned as colonisers of ancient great britain in all the ancient and medieval written sources while evidence of the neighbouring and much more powerful frisians concurrent colonising activities in great britain has been so limited to discoveries in archeological science and more often to logical deductions and inferences alone of course ethnic frisians are known to have inhabited the land directly in the path of any migration route from angeln to great britain except for the long and difficult route by sea around the northern tip of denmark and in fact they also inhabited lands between the ancient saxon domain and great britain yet they are rarely mentioned as having taken part in the vast migration st gregory the angles are the subject of a legend about pope gregory i ca 540 604 a d as an abbreviated version of the story goes gregory happened to see a group of angle children from deira for sale as slaves in the roman market struck by the beauty of their fair skinned complexions and bright blue eyes gregory inquired about their background when told they were angles he replied with a latin pun that translates well into english non angli sed angeli not angles but angels supposedly he thereafter resolved to convert their pagan homeland to christianity see also

 id=192503 title hans memling nonfiltered 281 processed 279 dbindex 1480283 hans memling memlinc c 1430 11 august 1494 was a flemish painter born in germany who was the last major fifteenth century artist in the netherlands the successor to jan van eyck and rogier van der weyden whose tradition he continued with little innovation life and works born in seligenstadt near frankfurt in the middle rhein region memling probably served his apprenticeship at mainz or cologne and later worked in the netherlands under rogier van der weyden c 1455 60 he did not come to bruges until about 1465 a story telling that he was a wounded fugitive from the battle of nancy is fiction as is also the report that he was sheltered and cured by the hospitallers at bruges and to show his gratitude refused payment for a picture he had painted memling did indeed paint for the hospitallers but he painted not one but many pictures and he did so in 1479 and 1480 being probably known to his patrons of st john by many masterpieces even before the battle of nancy memling is only connected with military operations in a mediate and distant sense his name appears on a list of subscribers to the loan which was raised by maximilian of austria maximilian i to crush hostilities against france in the year 1480 in 1477 when he is falsely said to have fallen and when charles the bold was killed he was under contract to furnish an altarpiece for the gild chapel of the booksellers of bruges and this altarpiece now reserved under the name of the seven griefs of mary in the gallery of turin is one of the fine creations of his riper age and not inferior in any way to those of 1479 in the hospital of st john which for their part are hardly less interesting as illustrative of the master s power than the last judgment in the cathedral of the hanse city gda sk danzig poland critical opinion has been unanimous in assigning the altarpiece of gda sk to memling and by this it affirms that memling was a resident and a skilled artist at bruges in 1473 for the last judgment was undoubtedly painted and sold to a merchant at bruges who shipped it there on board of a vessel bound to the mediterranean which was captured by a gda sk privateer paúel benecke in that very year but in order that memling s repute should be so fair as to make his pictures purchasable as this had been by an agent of the medici at bruges it is incumbent on us to acknowledge that he had furnished sufficient proofs before that time of the skill which excited the wonder of such highly cultivated patrons it is characteristic that the oldest allusions to pictures connected with memling s name are those which point to relations with the burgundian court the inventories of margaret of austria drawn up in 1524 allude to a triptych of the god of pity by roger van der weyden of which the wings containing angels were by master hans but this entry is less important as affording testimony in favour of the preservation of memling s work than as showing his connection with an older flemish craftsman for ages roger van der weyden was acknowledged as an artist of the school of bruges until records of undisputed authenticity demonstrated that he was bred at tournai and settled at brussels nothing seems more natural than the conjunction of his name with that of memling as the author of an altarpiece since though memling s youth remains obscure it is clear from the style of his manhood that he was taught in the painting room of van der weyden nor is it beyond the limits of probability that it was van der weyden who received commissions at a distance from brussels and first took his pupil to bruges where he afterwards dwelt the clearest evidence of the connexion of the two masters is that afforded by pictures particularly an altarpiece which has alternately been assigned to each of them and which may possibly be due to their joint labours in this altarpiece which is a triptych ordered for a patron of the house of sforza we find the style of van der weyden in the central panel of the crucifixion and that of memling in the episodes on the wings yet the whole piece was assigned to the former in the zambeccari collection at bologna whilst it was attributed to the latter at the middleton sale in london in 1872 at first we may think a closer resemblance might be traced between the two artists than that disclosed in later works of memling but the delicate organization of the younger painter perhaps also a milder appreciation of the duties of a christian artist may have led memling to realise a sweet and perfect ideal without losing on that account the feeling of his master he certainly exchanged the asceticism of van der weyden for a sentiment of less energetic concentration he softened his teacher s asperities and bitter hardness of expression in the oldest form in which memling s style is displayed or rather in that example which represents the baptist in the gallery of munich we are supposed to contemplate an effort of the year 1470 the finish of this piece is scarcely surpassed though the subject is more important by that of the last judgment in gda sk but the latter is more interesting than the former because it tells how memling long after roger s death and his own settlement at bruges preserved the traditions of sacred art which had been applied in the first part of the century by rogier van der weyden to the last judgment of beaune all that memling did was to purge his master s manner of excessive stringency and add to his other qualities a velvet softness of pigment a delicate transparence of colours and yielding grace of slender forms that such a beautiful work as the last judgment of gda sk should have been bought for the italian market is not surprising when we recollect that picture fanciers in that country were familiar with the beauties of memling s compositions as shown in the preference given to them by such purchasers as cardinal grimari and cardinal bembo at venice and the heads of the house of medici at florence but memling s reputation was not confined to italy or flanders the madonna and saints which passed out of the duchatel collection into the gallery of the louvre the virgin and child painted for sir john donne and now at the national gallery london and other noble specimens in english and continental private houses show that his work was as widely known and appreciated in the 16th century it was perhaps not their sole attraction that they gave the most tender and delicate possible impersonations of the mother of christ that could suit the taste of that age in any european country but the portraits of the donors with which they were mostly combined were more characteristic and probably more remarkable as likenesses than any that memling s contemporaries could produce nor is it unreasonable to think that his success as a portrait painter which is manifested in isolated busts as well as in altarpieces was of a kind to react with effect on the venetian school which undoubtedly was affected by the partiality of antonello da messina for trans alpine types studied in flanders in memling s time the portraits of sir john donne and his wife and children in the national gallery london altarpiece are also remarkable as models of drawing and finish than as refined presentations of persons of distinction nor is any difference in this respect to be found in the splendid groups of father mother and children which fill the noble altarpiece of the louvre as single portraits the busts of burgomaster moreel and his wife in the museum of brussels and their daughter the sibyl zambetha according to the added description in the hospital at bruges are the finest and most interesting of specimens the seven griefs of mary in the gallery of turin to which we may add the seven joys of mary in the pinakothek of munich are illustrations of the habit which clung to the art of flanders of representing a cycle of subjects on the different planes of a single picture where a wide expanse of ground is covered with incidents from the passion in the form common to the action of sacred plays the masterpiece of memling s later years a shrine containing relics of st ursula in the museum of the hospital of bruges is fairly supposed to have been ordered and finished in 1480 the delicacy of finish in its miniature figures the variety of its landscapes and costume the marvellous patience with which its details are given are all matters of enjoythent to the spectator there is later work of the master in the st christopher and saints of 1484 in the academy or the newenhoven madonna in the hospital of bruges or a large crucifixion with scenes from the passion of 1491 from the lübeck cathedral dom of lübeck now in lübeck s st annen museum but as we near the close of memling s career we observe that his practice has become larger than he can compass alone and as usual in such cases the labour of disciples is substituted for his own the registers of the painters corporation at bruges give the names of two apprentices who served their time with memling and paid dues on admission to the gild in 1480 and 1486 these subordinates remained obscure the trustees of his will appeared before the court of wards at bruges on december 10 1495 and we gather from records of that date and place that memling left behind several children and a considerable property passion altarpiece polyptych 1491 in lübeck critical opinions erwin panofsky in his 1953 early netherlandish painting p 347 says of memling rather harshly while the romantics and the victorians considered his sweetness the very summit of medieval art we feel inclined to compare him to a composer such as felix mendelssohn

 id=5015303 title lord s resistance army 1994 2002 nonfiltered 310 processed 307 dbindex 1480312 the start of the period 1994 to 2002 of the lord s resistance army lra insurgency in northern uganda saw the conflict intensifying due to sudanese support to the rebels there was a peak of bloodshed in the mid 1990s and then a gradual subsiding of the conflict violence was renewed beginning with the offensive by the uganda people s defence force in 2002 for an seven year period beginning in 1987 the lord s resistance army was a minor rebel group along the periphery of uganda however two weeks after museveni delivered his ultimatum of 6 february 1994 lra fighters were reported to have crossed the northern border and established bases in southern sudan with the approval of the khartoum government the end of the bigombe peace initiatives marks a fundamental shift in the character of the lord s resistance army which is estimated to have consisted of 3 000 to 4 000 combatants at this time this is the turning point at which the lra becomes essentially the organization that operates today sudanese support expands the scale of the conflict sudanese aid was a response to ugandan support for the rebel sudan people s liberation army spla fighting in the civil war in the south of the country prior to this support the lra could be treated as a minor irritant in the outskirts of the country now it also had to be considered a proxy force of the khartoum government sudanese support allowed the lra to increase the intensity of its operations beyond the level at which it was previously capable not only was a safe haven granted from which the lra could launch attacks into uganda but sudan also gave a large amount of arms ammunition land mines and other supplies in return the lra was expected to deny territory to the spla and periodically participate in joint operations with the sudanese army the increased intensity of attacks through proxy forces led uganda and sudan to the brink of open hostilities in 1995 acholi civilians as targets there was also a marked change in how the lra perceived the conflict having become convinced that the acholi were now collaborating with the museveni government kony began to target the civilians using his increased military strength mutilations such as those carried out in the wake of the arrow group strategy became commonplace and 1994 saw the first mass forced abduction of children and young people other militant groups such as the west nile bank front adopted the lra tactics of abductions and raids the strategy of forced recruitment was prompted by the lack of new volunteers to continue the conflict and the fact that the young could be indoctrinated to support the lra much more easily than adults furthermore the lra no longer had to spend much of its energies in the search for basic supplies now that they were supported by sudan the moral rationale was that since the acholi adults had proven themselves untrustworthy the lra must cleanse the land of them and create a new society with the children this philosophical approach similar to that taken by the khmer rouge of cambodia has been referred to as auto genocide the attacks on civilians have at least three strategic objectives first to deny the government information about its movements by forcing the rural population to flee second to gather resources from the looted villages third and most bizarrely to show the populace that the government is unable or unwilling to provide protection and thus encourage people to support to the lra while the lack of security has certainly embittered many acholi this has not translated into support for the lra forces that are attacking them there were numerous incidents that occurred after sudanese support and are exceptional because of the large number of victims the identity of the victims or the circumstances of the incident on april 22 1995 atiak trading center in northern gulu district was attacked and the local defense forces routed over the course of the day between 170 and 220 civilians were killed in the absence of resistance from government forces on march 8 1996 a civilian convoy of over 20 vehicles with a military escort of 14 soldiers travelling west on the karuma pakwach road was ambushed between 50 and 110 civilians were killed most after the escort had been overcome some were executed others were killed after they refused to exit their buses and explosives were thrown inside the lra carried out three separate attacks on july 13 to june 14 1996 upon a settlement of sudanese refugees in southern kitgum now pader district administered by the office of the un high commissioner for refugees approximately 100 refugees were killed in the lokung palabek massacre from january 7 to january 12 1997 up to 412 civilians were killed in and around the subcounties of lokung and palabek in northwest kitgum there were no opposing forces and most victims were bludgeoned or hacked to death the most famous attack of this period were the st mary s college aboke abductions on october 10 1996 at about 2 a m about 200 armed rebels broke into st mary s college in aboke northern apac district and abducted 139 secondary school girls between 13 and 16 years of age before leaving at about 5 a m at 7 a m the deputy head mistress of the college sister rachele fassera pursued the rebels and negotiated the release of 109 of the girls five of the thirty remaining girls died in captivity all but two eventually made their escape as of 2006 government forces have also been the focus of controversy on august 31 1995 thirteen civilians some with their hands tied behind their backs were killed in a government gunship attack on an lra column near lokung northwest kitgum sixteen lra combatants were also killed critics charged reckless disregard for abductee lives the government claimed the killings were accidental and unintentional the military contributed to mob killings in gulu town on august 16 1996 four lra suspects were turned over to an acholi mob that beat them to death the suspects were under government custody and are reported to have been turned over to the mob in the presence of senior uganda fourth division officers the deaths of two acholi elders on 8 june 1996 remains a mystery mr okot ogony of cwero eastern gulu chairman of the peace commission of the council of acholi chiefs and mr olanya lacony a respected elder from kac goma southwestern gulu were found murdered near cwero in still unexplained circumstances they were the leaders of a local initiative to restart the peace talks that had collapsed in february 1994 and had the approval of the president of uganda and an invitation from the lra some blame the lra while others point to corrupt national resistance army officers protected villages created in 1996 the creation of government protected villages beginning in 1996 further deepened the antagonistic attitude that many acholi have toward the government while many acholi were already displaced by the conflict they resented being ordered into camps a strategy of resettlement or villagization is a common anti insurgent technique used extensively for example by the united states throughout the indian wars to isolate native americans in reservations it is intended to free up troops that would otherwise be attempting to defend innumerable small communities and to deny the rebels access to resources nevertheless the population continues to be attacked by the lra even within the protected camps the camps are also crowded unsanitary and miserable places to live a culture of peace and a gradual subsiding the bloodshed in 1995 to 1996 appears to have convinced the population that a negotiated solution was the only acceptable option this is what one writer calls the emergence of a culture of peace as most of the lra combatants are abducted children a military solution is widely seen by the acholi as a massacre of victims government attempts to destroy the rebels are thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the acholi the moral ambiguity of this situation in which abducted young rebels are both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts is vital in understanding the current conflict meanwhile in 1997 the sudanese government of the national islamic front had begun to back away from its previous hard line stance this was prompted by the leadership of new president omar al bashir who wanted to ensure export of the oil from the newly developed fields being wrested from spla control the u s had also taken a more proactive stance against the national islamic front government u s pressure on sudan intensified following the 1998 bombing of the american embassies in kenya and tanzania by al qaeda operatives with links to sudan over the next several years khartoum is believed to have substantially curtailed aid to the lra in 1999 the carter center mediated the nairobi agreement between uganda and sudan which restored diplomatic relations in 2001 in 2000 the parliament of uganda passed the amnesty act this act pardons rebels who give themselves up to the amnesty commission and renounce violence while it did not end the insurgency it proved effective enough in some of the other regions of the country that had experienced rebellion to be maintained the sudden appearance of lra units in june 2001 who contacted local government officials to discuss the possibility of dialogue created a flurry of speculation that the lra was tiring of their insurgency the uganda people s defense force the renamed nra created a demilitarized zone for the talks a measure that had the implicit approval of president museveni the talks were exploratory in nature and the lra units eventually returned to sudan however analysts believed that they were initiated at the behest of kony and indicated the most promising diplomatic environment since the collapse of the bigombe talks in 1994 following the al qaeda attacks in 2001 upon the world trade center and the pentagon in the u s the relationship between sudan and uganda abruptly changed the nif government was anxious to avoid any blame that may be attached to them for their offering of sanctuary to al qaeda leader osama bin laden for several years in the 1990s also following the lra s designation as a terrorist organization by the u s state department on 5 december 2001 sudan agreed to stop supplying aid to the lra cross border tensions were dialed down as support to proxy forces fell the lra itself appeared settled into their sudanese base camps and only periodically crossed the border some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced by the war began to return to their homes the number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million and people began to talk openly of the day when the protected camps would be disbanded notes and references endofarticle doc doc

 id=573460 title space ghost coast to coast nonfiltered 327 processed 324 dbindex 1480329 space ghost coast to coast often abbreviated as sgc2c is an animated spoof talk show on the cable tv channel cartoon network in the united states bravo in the uk and teletoon in canada it began in 1994 the main cast comprises space ghost born tad ghostal a cartoon character originally from an old hanna barbera cartoon called space ghost which ran in the 1960s and early 1980s and zorak and moltar his former enemies from that show space ghost is voiced by george lowe while c martin croker voices zorak and moltar other characters include brak lokar metallus black widow and tansut all of whom also made appearances in the original hanna barbera series the fictional talk show is shot and broadcast from space ghost s studio on the ghost planet space ghost also has a twin brother chad who is somewhat smarter but has an apparent evil streak luckily he can be identified by his ever changing facial hair macho voice and his use of hipster slang various celebrities appear on the show as guests they are shown on a tv screen next to space ghost and unlike the characters they are not animated space ghost coast to coast uses the talk show format as its template but subverts it regularly space ghost himself is portrayed as pompous ignorant and slightly deranged he apparently believes his guests are other superheroes and usually opens the interview by asking them about their superpowers his interactions with guests are almost always painfully awkward and sometimes hostile it is sometimes hard to tell if all of the guests are really aware of the nature of the program on which they are appearing their answers often do not match the questions coming from space ghost because the questions are changed after the interview his relationship with his co workers is worse his bandleader an evil talking mantis named zorak and his producer a red helmeted lava man named moltar work for space ghost as punishment for their crimes and make no secret of the fact that they hate him space ghost is shown to be arrogant showboatish uninformed oblivious to his own stupidity and violent when provoked his powers include invisibility courtesy of his inviso belt although it s really just an outline of sg flight and the ability to shoot powerful beams from the power bands on his wrists zorak attempts to be pure evil even if neutered by his imprisonment and spends his time on the show making fun of space ghost generally getting blasted in return for his efforts by space ghost s power bands at other times however his resistance to space ghost is more oblique preferring to just ignore space ghost s quixotic tendencies in a quiet method of rebellion moltar is more placid about his predicament and enjoys watching chips reruns on the monitors during the show as well as talking to the guests before their interviews but he will often chide space ghost along with zorak and become his sidekick in tormenting space ghost unlike most modern cable series each episode of space ghost coast to coast is only 15 minutes in length to remedy this cartoon network stuck two episodes back to back in order to make a 30 minute programming block something adult swim comprised mostly of the creators of sgc2c has duplicated in much of its original programming in 1995 cartoon network created a spin off show called cartoon planet this featured space ghost and friends attempting to host a variety show on the cartoon planet cartoon network placed this show right after coast to coast in order to attract ratings the brak show a situation comedy starring brak s hijinks as an adolescent was also spun off as an independent 15 minute program show production part of the surreal nature of the show comes from the guests sometimes awkward and disjointed responses to space ghost s questions and other events around the set this is the intentional result of the production process that was first laid out in the original unaired pilot episode this episode was created by mike lazzo who interspersed stock and original material with completely unrelated promotional video of denzel washington being interviewed about the oscars when the show was picked up similar interviews were orchestrated with guests to achieve the same comedic effect before any part of the episodes are written the guests are interviewed by a writer producer originally a space ghost costume was worn by andy merrill one which he later made famous in some cartoon planet intros more often the writer producer appears in normal dress but may still impersonate space ghost s character traits and mannerisms in many cases the interviewee is alone in a studio while the interviewer conducts the session over a speaker phone in the all black room where the interview takes place the guests are told what basic directions to look in to talk to zorak moltar or space ghost the interviewer also rarely reveals his actual name so that the guest is forced to address him as space ghost this serves to both maintain continuity and to engender a sense of bewilderment in the guest guests are asked questions which often reveal a hidden new world agenda after an interview is done the writing team goes back over it taking pieces out of context and out of order then assembling them into the responses to space ghost and the rest of the show the episode is written around these canned reactions and the writing talent of producers williams street known as ghost planet industries named after the fictional studio where sgc2c is supposedly taped for most of the show s run most of the show s earlier guests probably assumed they were participating in a relatively straightforward interview albeit with an animated superhero giant insect and a man made of liquid magma as the series went on however more and more guests became at least peripherally familiar with what was going on some episodes were written to accommodate playfully hostile guests who called the show s bluff such as comedian and writer of one sgc2c episode joel hodgson s refusal to as he put it go down that road with you pretending we re in space and all others had skits written for the guests to perform in outside of the normal interviews still others had recurring guests familiar with the show s format reportedly weird al yankovic walked into his coast to coast interview with answers he prepared ahead of time but opted not to use them theme song the theme song for space ghost coast to coast also known as the ghost planet national anthem was performed by avant jazz guitarist sonny sharrock and his drummer lance carter the theme song was extended in the episode sharrock as the episode itself is a tribute to sonny sharrock when the show reached its sixth season the theme song was abandoned it was shown a few times in season 8 however including a slow version for the episode in memory of elizabeth reed seasons 4 6 featured a new closing theme by man or astro man broadcast history in the united states space ghost coast to coast premiered on april 15 1994 on the cartoon network airing initially at 11 00pm on friday nights seven years before the advent of adult swim later the program was moved to various late night time slots usually on weekends these late night airings and the development of similar shows by williams street

after the end of his show he became a drunk that wandered around the williams street studios begging for a job however space ghost s show made another return on turner s broadband entertainment network gametap at e3 space ghost randomly showed up to conduct a series of live interviews including one with microsoft executive peter moore space ghost discussed bathroom etiquette his own video game idea a dermatology based video game sony turner and dancing with moore beyond the original run of the series at least two additional episodes were announced and had their respective interviews filmed but were never finished these included interviews with seth green and family guy creator seth macfarlane while neither of these interviews were aired in any episode of the show an easter egg on the volume 3 set features commander andy andy merrill talking to macfarlane space ghost has also been featured in a commercial for e surance interviewing the company s spokes cartoon erin space ghost spent most of the interview fantasing about sleeping with her characters space ghost voiced by george lowe tad ghostal was once a superhero and famous television star but fell into obscurity after his show was cancelled he sees his current employment as host of a relatively mediocre late night talk show as pale compared to his glory days he is remarkably egotistical despite his overwhelming idiocy and remains generally oblivious to his surroundings he has little regard for the well being of others and often demeans his sidekicks and guests zorak voiced by c martin croker the band leader and a mantis like alien zorak is known for his hatred of space ghost extremely evil he once ate his own nephew he is a virgin by virtue of not wanting to be killed by his mate as is the custom he has no remorse feels no pity and acts only to meet his own ends he was brak s childhood friend moltar voiced by c martin croker is the show s director producer his body is made entirely of lava and he normally wears a full body containment suit by far the most competent and level headed character he has attempted sometimes successfully to escape ghost planet on several occasions he has been happily married for about five years to a woman named linda and his father was a professional wrestler swingin chad ghostal voiced by brad abelle space ghost s evil twin brother distinguished from space ghost in physical appearance only by a crudely drawn goatee he is a hipster and is both extremely cool and evil so much so in fact that he makes moltar and zorak look like total chumps chad loves jazz music hipster talk and outdated slang he is also quite the ladies man he is currently a fugitive wanted for murder and escaping the asylum he was held in he may be a rendition of the space spectre space ghost s opposite number during his time as a superhero tansut voiced by don kennedy is an overweight and cowardly man in a red costume and helmet this outfit makes him out to be much more cruel than he actually acts he is easily scared and is often ridiculed for his cowardice for a while he was the announcer on the show telling the viewers who the guests would be for the episode and has subbed for moltar as director at least once brak voiced by andy merrill loud childish and physically harmless brak is the least threatening villain on the program yet his capacity to annoy others and eat beans is nothing less than potent his most uttered phrase was for a time a loud grating hi my name is brak he is thought by some to have some mental deficiency on the spinoff show cartoon planet he claimed that radiation half lobotomized me possibly a reference to the original space ghost cartoon he appeared on sgc2c periodically and was often victimized by space ghost or the show s villains he eventually somehow obtained his own spinoff the brak show lokar voiced by andy merrill cultured and erudite despite being a shrill voiced giant hominid locust prone to violent outbursts lokar still harbors a bit of a grudge and seeks space ghost s destruction perhaps more for his boorishness than anything else he is frequently accused of being effeminate by other cast members he has a penchant for bourgeois phrases like you go girl he claims his hatred for space ghost is delicious he is also in a long running feud with zorak the original way outs are the show s band made up of former villains they are apparently space ghost s prisoners just like zorak and moltar but are much less talkative usually when they are cued to play music and the whole band is in view music is definitely played but not by them while the music is playing usually the only thing literally moving in the band is one cymbal on the drum set harvey birdman originally auditioned to be the host of the show according to episode 40 pilot he s similar to space ghost in that he is a washed up superhero incompetent and slow and horrible with people not to mention that he can t work nights due to needing the sun s energy to stay awake space ghost once called him a washed up six piece chicken mcnobody he reprises his role as host on episode 74 sequel during space ghost s brief imprisonment for abusing zorak he also appeared on the side lines during episode 35 rehearsal and making a call on episode 55 telethon he appears to be washed up and in a rut alternately claiming to be unemployed or in one case selling towable campers he used to be married to gravity girl whom he constantly pleads to come home the character in sgc2c has little to do with the show harvey birdman attorney at law beyond giving the first name of harvey to the character metallus a villain who can only talk in a metallic drone black widow voiced by judy tenuta a villain who has professed love for space ghost much to the chagrin of the other villains kirk the storyteller played by james kirkconnell the venerable narrator storyteller presenting several episodes in retrospect and reinterpretation the episode curses was shown to have taken place in one of his nightmares trivia according to tv guide articles written when the show was in pre production former fantasy island star hervé villechaize was to be space ghost s sidekick on the show however villechaize committed suicide before production began some episodes suggest personal relationships with the guest the most odd one was the interview with al alcorn in one of the gametap episodes al here known as mr pong was as space ghost claimed shacking up with a mantis zorak when he revealed himself to be zorak s father it is obviously untrue even though alcorn

may 1959 to choose the members of the legislative assembly of singapore under the constitution of singapore in 1959 the members of legislative assembly was fully determined by the population of singapore and the political party who won the majority of the assembly seats would form the ruling government much like the modern parliament of singapore candidates were nominated on 25 april 1959 and the actual polls were held on 30 may the people s action party pap eventually won the general election in a landslide winning 43 out of 51 seats the 1959 general election was the pap s first victory in terms of being the ruling party of singapore presently it continues to be the ruling party of singapore and has never lost control of the singaporean legislature since the 1959 elections it was the first election after which singapore officially achieved self rule an election of firsts the 1959 general election was also the first election to be held since full internal self government was granted by the british empire which singapore was part of at the time compulsory voting was also implemented for the first time singapore was not fully independent as the british still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations however singapore was now a recognised state and the entire legislative assembly for the first time was wholly determined by the local population previously under the rendel constitution which was a 1955 reform of the constitution of singapore the legislature and its leaders could not fully be determined by the population the british government instead appointed 7 of the 33 total members although the rest was by election with limited suffrage this itself was an improvement from the pre 1955 legislative council of singapore when only 6 out of over twenty members were elected campaign issues and platforms discontent with the labour front the ruling party at the time was the labour front which had won the general election of 1955 david saul marshall who headed the labour front in 1955 and was chosen as chief minister had since resigned in 1956 by 1959 the labour front was in turmoil although they had been very successful at campaigning in 1955 much of the issues resounded around the topic of independence as well as political issues such as the communist insurgency led by the malayan communist party mcp which had been causing the malayan emergency 1948 1960 during the 1955 election the pap protested against the existence of appointed members as set forth by the rendel constitution and become the main opposition party following the election and the singapore progressive party spp which had been one of the most dominant parties in the 1948 election and the 1951 election had become increasingly displaced at this point the desire for independence and self government epitomised by the malay term merdeka had started to become immediate this was reflected when the cry of we want merdeka now was taken up by those demanding immediate independence the spp fell out of favour as it was perceived by much of the electorate by working for reform too slowly david marshall was vocally anti british and anti colonialist and the british found it difficult to come to an agreement or a compromise eventually after failing to reach any agreement about a definite plan for self government he resigned in 1956 following a pledge that he would achieve self government or resign lim yew hock another labour front member took his place he pursued an aggressive anti communist campaign and manage to convince the british to make a definite plan for self government the constitution of singapore was revised accordingly in 1958 replacing the rendel constitution with one that granted singapore self government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its legislative assembly however lim s tactics against the communists alienated a large part of the singaporean chinese electorate the demographic targeted most during the anti communist campaign there were also allegations of civil rights violations as many activists were detained without trial with the justification of internal security and tear gas were used against demonstrating students from several chinese schools both anti colonialist and anti communist alike campaign of the people s action party the people s action party made an election issue out of the harsh repression by lim yew hock the pap was left wing at the time and attracted many sympathisers in addition to many left wing members there were also many centrist members and a handful of right wing members at the time the party was thus able to attract support from a large and diverse electorate the pap pursued an aggressive election campaign which included large rallies and door to door campaigning as the labour front government was rife with corruption and perceived misdealing the pap capitalised on this by promoting a corruption free image and its members white robes were to signify the purity that the pap declared it had in contrast to the labour front the name of the pap promising action and reform went along with this portrayal already a formidable faction at the 1955 general elections the pap grew exceptionally popular results the voter turnout for the election was 527 919 out of a total 586 098 voters or 92 9 of the total eligible voters this was a huge turnout especially when compared to the 1955 general election in which only 158 075 of 300 199 voters turned out or 52 7 of the total eligible voters there were two historical attributions for this one was the implementation of compulsory voting the other the removal of suffrage restrictions that had previously limited voting rights to those born in singapore or those who had lived there for a certain amount of time over 51 seats were available for contesting during the election which was almost a 50 increase from the total seats at the 1955 general election and more than double of the seats if only elected seats are considered in contrast to the elections that would follow in the future after the 1963 general election there were no walkovers legacy with the successful conclusion of the election all the members of the parliament were now elected and thus theoretically achieved full consent of the governed the pap as ruling party was able to form a new government of singapore on 3 june 1959 that was fully elected which could now adopt domestic policy without oversight from the colonial administration the united kingdom still however controlled the military forces foreign affairs and had a joint responsibility in internal security under agreement however the year of the conclusion of the elections and the formation of the new government 1959 is generally the date specified by historians for the achievement of self government for singapore even though the constitution had been amended in 1958 before taking over the governance of singapore lee kuan yew secured the release of several pap members who were arrested under the emergency regulation in 1956 and 1957 including left wing leader lim chin siong during the election campaign lee had advocated for their release as part of his election platform and thus was able to mobilise the support of many trade union members after their release lim chin siong and his affiliates would later challenge lee s leadership in the pap leading to the expulsion of most of the left wing members from the pap in 1961 the expelled members formed the barisan sosialis and would contest the 1963 general elections against the pap although having been crippled by operation coldstore they put up a fight that to date is the only election that threatened to remove the pap from power while it was an existing ruling party it however lost and went into a decline affirming the pap as ruling party by elections during the course of the parliament two by elections were held singapore by election april 1961 singapore

 id=1096607 title feminist legal theory nonfiltered 383 processed 380 dbindex 1480385 feminist legal theory is based on the belief that the law has been instrumental in women s historical subordination the project of feminist legal theory is twofold first feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law plays a role in women s subordinate status second feminist legal theory is dedicated to changing women s status through a reworking of the law and its approach to gender the four primary approaches to feminist jurisprudence are the liberal equality model the sexual difference model the dominance model and the postmodern or anti essentialist model each model provides a distinct view of the legal mechanisms that contribute to women s subordination and each offers a distinct method for changing legal approaches to gender the liberal equality model operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights based approach to law though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice this model focuses on ensuring that women are afforded genuine equality as opposed to the nominal equality often given them in the traditional liberal framework and seeks to achieve this either by way of a more thorough application of liberal values to women s experiences or the revision of liberal categories to take gender into account susan okin for example has critiqued liberal approaches to justice for their complete neglect of gender and its injustice the difference model emphasizes the significance of the differences between men and women and holds that these differences should not be obscured by the law but should be taken into account by it only by taking into account differences can the law provide adequate remedies for women s situation which is in fact distinct from men s the difference model is in direct opposition to the sameness account which holds that women s sameness to men should be emphasized to the sameness feminist employing women s differences in an attempt to garner greater rights is ineffective and places emphasis on the very characteristics of women that have historically precluded them from achieving equality to men the dominance model and its most notable proponent catharine mackinnon reject liberal feminism and view the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance sexuality is central to mackinnon s dominance account she argues that women s sexuality is socially constructed by male dominance and that women s subordination results primarily from the sexual dominance of women by men a major line of critique of the dominance model is that it leaves no room for women s agency since women are victims whose lives are fundamentally shaped by male dominance the difficulty of the dominance model is that it leaves little or no room for women s genuine autonomy or agency feminists from the postmodern camp have deconstructed the notions of objectivity and neutrality claiming that every perspective is socially situated anti essentialist and intersectionalist critiques of feminist jurisprudence have objected to the idea that there can be any universal women s voice and have criticized feminists for implicitly basing their work on the experiences of white middle class heterosexual women the anti essentialist and intersectionalist project has been to explore the ways in which race class sexual orientation and other axes of subordination interplay with gender and to uncover the implicit detrimental assumptions that have often been employed in feminist theory endofarticle doc doc

 id=40365 title galvanometer nonfiltered 395 processed 392 dbindex 1480397 a galvanometer is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current it is an electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection through a limited arc in response to electric current flowing through its coil the name galvanometer has been applied to devices used in measuring recording and positioning equipment operation the most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument often called a meter it is used to measure the direct current flow of electric charges through an electric circuit such devices are constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet the coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale a tiny spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position in some meters the magnetic field acts on a small piece of iron to perform the same effect as a spring when a direct current dc flows through the coil the coil generates a magnetic field this field acts with or against the permanent magnet the coil pivots pushing against the spring and moving the pointer the hand points at a scale indicating the electric current a useful meter generally contains some provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer so that the pointer position smoothly tracks the current without excess vibration the basic sensitivity of a meter might be for instance 100 microamperes full scale with a voltage drop of say 50 millivolts at full current such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude the use of current dividers often called shunts allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents a meter can be calibrated as a dc voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current a meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit this is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil a meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage a battery and an adjustable resistor in a preparatory step the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection when an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor because the pointer of the meter is usually a small distance above the scale of the meter parallax error can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that lines up with the pointer to counter this some meters include a mirror along the markings of the principal scale the accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by moving the head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned at this point the operator s eye must be directly above the pointer and any parallax error has been minimized types extremely sensitive measuring equipment once used mirror galvanometers that substituted a mirror for the pointer a beam of light reflected from the mirror acted as a long massless pointer such instruments were used as receivers for early trans atlantic telegraph systems for instance the moving beam of light could also be used to make a record on a moving photographic film producing a graph of current versus time in a device called an oscillograph galvanometer mechanisms are used to position the pens of analog chart recorders such as used for making an electrocardiogram strip chart recorders with galvanometer driven pens might have a full scale frequency response of 100 hz and several centimeters deflection in some cases the classical polygraph of movies or the electroencephalograph the galvanometer is strong enough to move the pen while it remains in contact with the paper the writing mechanism may be a heated tip on the needle writing on heat sensitive paper or a fluid fed pen in other cases the rustrak recorders the needle is only intermittently pressed against the writing medium at that moment an impression is made and then the pressure is removed allowing the needle to move to a new position and the cycle repeats in this case the galvanometer need not be especially strong uses mirror galvanometer systems are used as beam positioning elements in laser optical systems these are typically high power galvanometer mechanisms used with closed loop servo control systems they can have frequency responses over 1 khz galvanometers have been replaced as measuring instruments by analog to digital converters adc for most uses there are for instance self contained digital measuring systems called digital panel meters dpms available to replace most traditional analog meter functions history the term galvanometer derives from the surname of luigi galvani many early applications of galvanometers for measuring and recording are associated with william thomson lord kelvin the earliest galvanometer was reported by johann johan schweigger of nuremberg at the university of halle on 16th september 1820 andré marie ampère also contributed to the development of the galvanometer external link selection of historic galvanometer in the virtual

the house of karn which was virtually destroyed in the sack of pellinor as they attempted escape the young maerad and her mother were betrayed by the corrupt enkir later first bard of norloch and were sold into slavery to the petty feudal tyrant gilman though thought to have perished along with dorn her brother cai survived and was stolen by bards who have turned from the light known as hulls the undead servants of the nameless one sharma who seeks to keep the treesong split and hidden from the elementals in the belief that cai was in fact thought to be the foretold he was taken by the hulls whom he refers to as black bards to an orphanage where they attempted to corrupt him to the dark they changed cai s name to hem to better reflect his new life in the north as this is a common name amongst the pilani the gift meanwhile maerad and her mother lived at gilman s cot as slaves weakened by her broken spirit milana died before maerad reached puberty and she lived alone fulfilling her duties from then onwards though she was a vulnerable girl she appears to have managed to avoid the more harsh and degrading punishments meted out to female slaves as even as an untrained bard she was considered to be witch like and capable of placing the evil eye on those who sought to treat her roughly when cadvan of lirigon came through the cot ensorcelled in a glimmerspell to hide him maerad saw him and he realised that she was an untrained bard he agreed to assist her escape from gilman and took her to the school of innail where maerad learns of her heritage for the first time and begins

foretold one she who will wrest the treesong back into the light and worst the nameless one even in his greatest uprising it is in the city of norloch cadvan s mentor nelac confirms this to be the case as he initiates maerad as a full bard whereupon her truename is revealed to be that prophecised elednor the fire lily of edil amarandh it is here that maerad also encounters enkir now first bard of norloch and is forced to flee with cadvan to the island nation of thorold she also comes into the speech which allows her to converse fully with other bards and animals including her horse imi and cadvan s stallion darsor the riddle further signs are given in thorold that something is wrong at the heart of the light when the rite of renewal nearly fails and is only completed at the timely intervention of cadvan and that maerad s role in this is more complicated than that of a normal bard we are also given the first inidcation that she is susceptible to the temptations of the dark and she is warned that her greatest danger my be to herself we are also told of the split song and how the treesong was split by sharma the nameless one in his attempt to become immortal in a similar

accidentally kills ilar of lirigon a bard of cadvan s school who attempts to take them into custody after they are named as outlaws by enkir this is taken by cadvan to be a sign of maerad s seduction by the dark and her elemental powers and when they are attacked in the mountain passes by the servants of the winterking maerad is distressed to find she is no longer able to join her own power to that of cadvan which seemingly results in his death in an avalanche in fact darsor has saved both cadvan and himnself by bolting into a cave in the side of the mountain rescued by ardina the dying

as he thinks to keep her with him forever enchanted to be his queen though he is in some ways cold and cruel maerad find the elemental part of her attracted to arkan and her hatred of him is tempered when she discovers he has been betrayed by the nameless and does not consider himself sharma s ally in her conversations with the winterking she learns that her lyre which belonged to her mother milana bears runes which form one half of the treesong although arkan can tell her what they mean he is unable to reveal the music of the treesong it is believed that sharma the nameless has the other

physician and humanist his interests included many sciences astronomy and meteorology geography jurisprudence study of the bible mathematics anatomy and medicine he is renowned in the history of several of these fields particularly medicine and theology he participated in the protestant reformation and later developed an anti trinitarian theology condemned by catholics and protestants alike he was burnt at the stake by order of the geneva governing council as a heretic early life and education servetus was born in villanueva de sijena huesca spain in 1511 probably on september 29 his patron saint s day although no specific record exists some sources give an earlier date based on servetus own occasional claim of being born in 1509 his paternal ancestors came from the hamlet of serveto in the aragonian pyrenees which gave the family their surname the maternal line descended from jewish conversos of the monzón area in 1524 his father antonio serveto alias revés i e reverse who was a notary at the royal monastery of sijena nearby sent young michael to college probably at the university of zaragoza or lérida servetus had two brothers one who became a notary like their father and another who was a catholic priest servetus was very gifted in languages and studied latin greek and hebrew at the age of fifteen servetus entered the service of a franciscan friar by the name of juan de quintana an erasmian and read the entire bible in its original languages from the manuscripts that were available at that time he later attended the university of toulouse in 1526 where he studied law there he became suspect of participating in secret meetings and activities of protestant students in 1529 servetus traveled through germany and italy with quintana who was then charles v s confessor in the imperial retinue in october 1530 he visited johannes oecolampadius in basel staying there for about ten months and probably supporting himself as a proofreader for a local printer by this time he was already spreading his beliefs in may 1531 he met martin bucer and fabricius capito in strasbourg then two months later in july he published de trinitatis erroribus on the errors of the trinity the next year he published dialogorum de trinitate dialogues on the trinity and de iustitia regni christi on the justice of christ s reign in these books servetus built a theology which maintains that the belief of the trinity is not based on biblical teachings but rather on what he saw as deceiving teachings of greek philosophers he saw himself as leading a return to the simplicity and authenticity of the gospels and the early church fathers in part he hoped that the dismissal of the trinitarian dogma would also make christianity more appealing to judaism and islam which had remained as strictly monotheistic religions servetus affirmed that the divine logos which was a manifestation of god and not a separate divine person was united to a human being jesus when god s spirit came into the womb of the virgin mary only from the moment of conception the son was actually generated therefore the son was not eternal but only the logos from which he was formed for this reason servetus always rejected that christ was the eternal son of god but rather that he was simply the son of the eternal god this theology although totally original has often been compared to adoptionism and to sabellianism or modalism which were old christian heresies under severe pressure from catholics and protestants alike servetus somehow modified this explanation in his second book dialogues to make the logos coterminous with christ this made it nearly identical with the pre nicene view but he was still accused of heresy because of his insistence on denying the dogma of the trinity and the individuality of three divine persons in one god he took on the pseudonym michel de villeneuve i e michael from villanueva in order to avoid persecution by the church because of these religious works he studied at the college calvi in paris in 1533 after an interval he returned to paris to study medicine in 1536 in paris his teachers included sylvius fernel and guinter who hailed him with vesalius as his most able assistant in dissections career after his studies in medicine he started a medical practice he became personal physician to archbishop palmier of vienne and was also physician to guy de maugiron the lieutenant governor of dauphiné while he practiced medicine near lyon for about fifteen years he also published two other works dealing with ptolemy s geography servetus dedicated his first edition of ptolemy and his edition of the bible to his patron hugues de la porte and dedicated his second edition of ptolemy s geography to his other patron archbishop palmier while in lyon symphorien champier a medical humanist had been servetus patron and the pharmacological tracts which servetus wrote there were written in defense of champier against leonard fuchs while also working as a proof reader he published a couple more books which dealt with medicine and pharmacology years earlier he had sent a copy to john calvin initiating a correspondence between the two in initial correspondence servetus used the pseudonym michel de villeneuve in 1553 servetus published yet another religious work with further antitrinitarian views it was entitled christianismi restitutio a work that sharply rejected the idea of predestination and the idea that god had condemned souls to hell regardless of worth or merit god insisted servetus condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought word or deed to calvin who had written the fiery christianae religionis institutio servetus latest book was a slap in the face the irate calvin sent a copy of his own book as his reply servetus promptly returned it thoroughly annotated with insulting observations calvin wrote to servetus i neither hate you nor despise you nor do i wish to persecute you but i would be as hard as iron when i behold you insulting sound doctrine with so great audacity in time their correspondences grew more heated until calvin ended it whereupon servetus bombarded calvin with a slew of extraordinarily unfriendly letters chapter xxi page 481 thus calvin s antagonism against servetus seems to have been based not simply on his unorthodox views but also on servetus s tone of superiority mixed with personal abuse calvin stated of servetus when writing to his friend william farel on 13 february 1546 servetus has just sent me a long volume of his ravings if i consent he will come here but i will not give my word for if he comes here if my authority is worth anything i will never permit him to depart alive si venerit modo valeat mea autoritas vivum exire nunquam patiar imprisonment and execution on 16 february 1553 servetus while in vienne was denounced as a heretic by guillaume trie a rich merchant who took refuge in geneva and a very good friend of calvin in a letter sent to a cousin antoine arneys living in lyon on behalf of the french inquisitor matthieu ory servetus as well as arnollet the printer of christianismi restitutio were questioned but they denied all charges and were released for lack of evidence arneys was asked by ory to write back to trie demanding proof on march 26 1553 the book and the letters sent by servetus to calvin were forwarded to lyon by trie on april 4 1553 servetus was arrested by the roman catholic authorities and imprisoned in vienne he escaped from prison three days later on june 17 he was convicted of heresy by the french inquisition thanks to the 17 letters sent by jehan calvin preacher in geneva and sentenced to be burned with his books an effigy and his books were burned in his absence meaning to flee to italy servetus stopped in at geneva where calvin and his reformers had denounced him on august 13 he attended a sermon by calvin at geneva he was immediately recognized and arrested after the service and was again imprisoned and had all his property confiscated unfortunately for servetus at this time calvin was fighting to maintain his weakening power in geneva calvin s delicate health and usefulness to the state meant he did not personally appear against servetus also calvin s opponents used servetus as a pretext for attacking the geneva reformer s theocratic government it became a matter of prestige for calvin to be the instigator of servetus s prosecution he was forced to push the condemnation of servetus with all the means at his command however nicholas de la fontaine played the more active role in servetus s prosecution and the listing of points that condemned him at his trial servetus was condemned on two counts for spreading and preaching nontrinitarianism and anti paedobaptism anti infant baptism of paedobaptism michael servetus had said it is an invention of the devil an infernal falsity for the destruction of all christianity whatever the cause of them be it irritation or mistreatment his statements that common christian traditions were of the devil severely harmed his ability to make allies nevertheless sebastian castellio denounced his execution and became a harsh critic of calvin due to the whole affair in the case the procureur general who was not nicholas added some curious sounding accusations in the form of inquiries the most odd sounding perhaps being whether he has married and if he answers that he has not he shall be asked why in consideration of his age he could refrain so long from marriage to this oblique imputation of unchastity servetus replied that rupture had long since made him incapable of that particular sin more offensive to modern ears might be the question whether he did not know that his doctrine was pernicious considering that he favors jews and turks by making excuses for them and if he has not studied the koran in order to disprove and controvert the doctrine and religion that the christian churches hold together with other profane books from which people ought to abstain in matters of religion according to the doctrine of st paul although calvin believed servetus deserving of death on account of his execrable blasphemies he nevertheless hoped that it would not be by fire as he was inclined toward clemency calvin expressed these sentiments in a letter to farel written about a week after servetus arrest in which he also mentions an exchange between himself and servetus calvin writes after he had been recognized i thought he should be detained my friend nicolas summoned him on a capital charge offering himself as a security according to the lex talionis on the following day he adduced against him forty written charges he at first sought to evade them accordingly we were summoned he impudently reviled me just as if he regarded me as obnoxious to him i answered him as he deserved of the man s effrontery i will say nothing but such was his madness that he did not hesitate to say that devils possessed divinity yea that many gods were in individual devils inasmuch as a deity had been substantially communicated to those equally with wood and stone i hope that sentence of death will at least be passed on him but i desired that the severity of the punishment be mitigated as servetus was not a citizen of geneva and legally could at worst be banished they had consulted with other swiss cantons zurich bern basel schaffhausen which universally favored his condemnation and execution in the protestant world basel banned the sale of his book martin luther condemned his writing in strong terms servetus and philip melanchthon had strongly hostile views of each other most protestant reformers saw servetus as a dangerous radical and the concept of religious freedom did not really exist yet the catholic world had also imprisoned him and condemned him to death which apparently spurred calvin to equal their rigor those who went against the idea of his execution the party called libertines drew the ire of much of christendom on 24 october servetus was sentenced to death by burning for denying the trinity and infant baptism when calvin requested that servetus be executed by decapitation rather than fire farel in a letter of september 8 chided him for undue leniency and the geneva council refused his request on 27 october 1553 servetus was burned at the stake just outside geneva historians record his last words as jesus son of the eternal god have mercy on me the common view of the age that heretics like servetus should be subject to punishment was explained by calvin as follows whoever shall maintain that wrong is done to heretics and blasphemers in punishing them makes himself an accomplice in their crime and guilty as they are there is no question here of man s authority it is god who speaks and clear it is what law he will have kept in the church even to the end of the world wherefore does he demand of us a so extreme severity if not to show us that due honor is not paid him so long as we set not his service above every human consideration so that we spare not kin nor blood of any and forget all humanity when the matter is to combat for his glory modern relevance due to his rejection of the trinity and eventual execution by burning for heresy servetus is often regarded as the first unitarian martyr since the unitarians and universalists have joined in the united states and changed their focus his ideas are no longer very relevant to modern unitarian universalism a few scholars insist he had more in common with sabellianism or arianism or that he even had a theology unique to himself nevertheless his influence on the beginnings of the unitarian movement in poland and transylvania has been confirmed by scholars and two unitarian universalist congregations are named after him in minnesota and washington a church window is also dedicated to servetus at the first unitarian congregational society of brooklyn ny servetus was the first european to describe pulmonary circulation although it was not widely recognized at the time for a few reasons one was that the description appeared in a theological treatise christianismi restitutio not in a book on medicine further most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 three copies survived but these remained hidden for decades it was not until william harvey s dissections in 1616 that the function of pulmonary circulation was widely accepted by physicians in 1984 a zaragoza public hospital changed its name from josé

least claiming that he is married to a woman in a season 5 episode the perfect guy and much of the humor related to the character stems from his adamant denial of his supposed sexual orientation along with his general snarkiness in one memorable episode frasier is disturbed to find that he is having heavily symbolic and vaguely sexual dreams about gil frasier comes up with various interpreations hoping to prove that the dreams don t actually mean he is attracted to gil on some level but in the end none of the interpretations are satisfactory in the final season of the show gil s homosexuality

in the episode entiltied star mitzvah it is revealed that shempsky is jewish his claim to fame as seen when he volunteers to be the station representative during contract negotiations is that he can faint at will moon family members this section discusses the more significant members of daphne moon s family a large working class clan from manchester england many of the actors who play moon family members do not have specifically mancunian english accents anthony lapaglia richard e grant and robbie coltrane who portray daphne s brothers and brian cox who portrays her father were not even born in england la paglia is australian grant was born in swaziland and both coltrane and cox are scottish and this apparent discrepancy is never addressed on the show but may be taken as an in joke see

intensely loyal and subservient to her domineering and ever complaining gertrude is doting and always forgiving towards her son simon s selfish behaviour but is hyper critical of her ever supportive and long suffering daughter frequently guilting daphne into providing what she wants when gertrude leaves her husband she goes to seattle there she unsuccessfully tries to start a romance with martin

with niles intervention they attempted a reconciliation but it was short lived and harry moon eventually returned to england michael moon michael moon robbie coltrane is a brother of daphne s michael

random odd words such as boom simon moon simon moon anthony lapaglia is one of daphne s brothers an obnoxious and boorish heavy drinker and layabout simon has a difficult relationship with his sister largely because of simon s uncouth and selfish nature he is greatly disliked by both frasier and niles partly because of their class conscious nature but also because when in seattle he frequently stays with one of them often taking unreasonable liberties with regard to their homes possessions and alcohol supplies in the process conversely he gets on quite well with martin and despite his many negative qualities is quite a popular man who is very successful at attracting women roz is quite taken with him and him with her at first but she eventually catches on to his ways and rejects his advances simon appears in eight episodes stephen moon stephen moon richard e grant is daphne s favorite brother he appears in person in in the series finale goodnight seattle and speaks with grant s

 id=13057 title gatling gun nonfiltered 423 processed 419 dbindex 1480426 the gatling gun is a rapid repeating weapon invented in the 1860s which used multiple rotating barrels turned by a hand crank unlike earlier weapons such as the mitrailleuse which had limited capacity and long reloading times the gatling gun was reliable easy to load and had a high firing rate the gun was designed by the american inventor richard j gatling in 1861 and patented in 1862 the gatling gun may have been the first machine gun depending on how machine gun is defined as it was capable of firing continuous bursts of fire unlike designs like the maxim gun which operate the mechanism using a fraction of the power of the fired cartridge the gatling gun relies on external power such as a hand crank or motor some later gatling type weapons diverted gas from the barrels to spin the rotating barrels the term gatling gun is still used to refer to rotating barrel cannons such as m61 20mm cannon and its younger brother the gau 12 used in the ac 130 gunship history of the gatling although the gatling gun was designed in 1861 during the u s civil war in 1862 the u s government decided not to purchase any of the weapons because the firing mechanism lacked triggers and because the gatling guns were far too heavy to be set up quickly in combat even with design improvements the gatling gun still lacked a trigger and weighed an unwieldy 90 lb 41 kg however union general benjamin butler bought twelve and used them on the petersburg front during its debut in combat soldiers on both sides were awestruck by its power and destructive effect they were only put into limited service late in the war by the union army the british royal navy installed fixed gatling guns on its warships and us forces used them in the indian wars during the japanese boshin war 1868 1869 gatling guns were used in land battles and mounted on ships to repel boarders during the franco prussian war of 1870 1871 gatling guns were used by the french armies fighting in the provinces to replace the defective mitrailleuse the naval brigades serving during the anglo zulu war of 1879 used gatling guns in several battles gatling guns were used during the british bombardment of alexandria in 1882 gatling guns were used by the us side during the spanish american war most notably during the battle of san juan hill basic design the gatling gun was hand crank operated with six barrels revolving around a central shaft similar to the puckle gun early models had a fibrous matting stuffed in among the barrels which could be soaked with water to cool the barrels down later models eliminated the matting filled barrels as being counterproductive the ammunition was initially a steel cylinder charged with black powder and primed with a percussion cap because self contained brass cartridges had not yet been invented the shells were gravity fed into the breech through a hopper or stick magazine on top of the gun each barrel had its own firing mechanism after 1861 new brass cartridges similar to modern cartridges replaced the paper cartridge but gatling did not switch to them immediately the model of 1881 was designed to use the bruce style feed system u s patents 247 158 and 343 532 that accepted two rows of 45 70 cartridges while one row was being fed into the gun the other could be reloaded thus allowing sustained fire the final gun required four operators by 1876 the gatling gun had a theoretical rate of fire of 1 200 rounds per minute although 400 rounds per minute was more readily achievable in combat each barrel fires once per revolution at about the same position originally the gatling gun was produced in calibres ranging from one inch 25 4 mm down to 0 45 inch 11 43 mm the barrels a carrier and a lock cylinder were separate and all mounted on a solid plate revolving around a central shaft mounted on an oblong fixed frame the carrier was grooved and the lock cylinder was drilled with holes corresponding to the barrels each barrel had a single lock working in the lock cylinder on a line with the barrel the lock cylinder was encased and joined to the frame the casing was partitioned and through this opening the barrel shaft was journaled in front of the casing was a cam with spiral surfaces the cam imparted a reciprocating motion to the locks when the gun rotated also in the casing was a cocking ring with projections to cock and fire the gun turning the crank rotated the shaft cartridges held in a hopper dropped individually into the grooves of the carrier the lock was simultaneously forced by the cam to move forward and load the cartridge and when the cam was at its highest point the cocking ring freed the lock and fired the cartridge after the cartridge was fired the continuing action of the cam drew back the lock bringing with it the spent cartridge which then dropped to the ground the grouped barrel concept had been explored by inventors since the 18th century but poor engineering and the lack of a unitary cartridge made previous designs unsuccessful the initial gatling gun design used self contained reloadable steel cylinders with a chamber holding a ball and black powder charge and a percussion cap nipple on one end as the barrels rotated these steel cylinders dropped into place were fired and were then ejected from the gun the innovative features of the gatling gun were its independent firing mechanism for each barrel and the simultaneous action of the locks barrels carrier and breech the smallest calibre gun also had a broadwell drum feed in place of the curved magazine of the other guns the drum named after l w broadwell an agent for gatling s company comprised twenty stick magazines arranged around a central axis like the spokes of a wheel each holding twenty cartridges with the bullet noses oriented toward the central axis this significant invention does not appear to have been patented separately and may have been included in the april 9 1872 patent u s 125 563 a post and base apparently for mounting a broadwell drum is visible in figure 13 of u s 125 563 as each magazine emptied the drum was manually rotated to bring a new magazine into use until all 400 rounds had been fired the gatling gun was largely replaced after the development of the gas or recoil blowback concept which is the basis of most modern machine guns such guns could be made smaller and lighter and were less expensive to produce modern gatling style guns after gatling guns were replaced by lighter cheaper blowback style weapons the approach of using multiple rotating barrels fell into disuse for many decades however gatling gun style weapons made a return in the 1970s when weapons with very high rate of fire were needed in military aircraft such as the ac 130 gunship and ship based ciws for these modern rotating barrel cannons electric motors were used to rotate the barrel one of the main reasons for the resurgence of the gatling gun style design is the rotating barrel weapon s tolerance for continuous high volume rates of fire for example if 2000 rounds were fired non stop at high rate from a conventional single barrel weapon this would likely result in overheating of the barrel or a jam in the weapon in contrast a five barreled gatling gun style weapon firing 2000 rounds would fire 400 rounds per barrel which would be acceptable one example is the m61 vulcan 20 mm cannon the most commonly used member of a family of weapons designed by general electric and currently manufactured by general dynamics it is a six barrelled gatling capable of more than 6 000 rounds per minute a rate unachievable with a conventional machine gun similar systems are available ranging from 5 56 mm to 30 mm there was even a 37 mm gatling on the prototype t249 vigilante aa platform the rate of fire being somewhat inversely proportional to the size and mass of the ammunition which also determines the size and mass of the barrels during the vietnam war the 7 62 mm calibre m134 minigun was created as a helicopter weapon able to fire 6 000 rounds a minute from a 4 000 round linked belt the minigun proved to be one of the most effective non explosive projectile weapons ever built and is still used in helicopters today they are also used with lethal effectiveness on usaf ac 130 and ac 119 gunships their original high capacity airframes able to house the items needed for sustained operation with sophisticated navigation and target identification tools miniguns can be used effectively even against concealed targets the crew s ability to concentrate the gatling s fire very tightly produces the appearance of the red tornado from the light of the tracers as the gun platform circles a target at night in addition to the benefits mentioned above many modern systems have the advantage of being externally driven as opposed to relying on the energy from fired cartridges this increases their reliability as cartridge firing failure will not interrupt the operation cycle additionally certain other stoppages such as faulty extraction and many feeding related problems are eliminated or reduced considerably due to the external power source it should however be noted that although complex mechanically and uncommon modern systems that derive power from the ammunition do exist the world s fastest gatling style weapon the 10 000 rpm gsh 6 23 uses a gas operated drive system popular culture several popular action films have depicted modern gatling guns usually the m134 minigun and variants thereof as hand held weapons in the arnold schwarzenegger film predator jesse ventura s character had to be propped up during sequences where his m134 was fired even though it had only reduced power blanks in terminator 2 judgment day schwarzenegger s heavy duty android character used a minigun without a support these depictions are technically impossible as the combined weight of the weapon power supply and requisite ammunition is much too great for human portable use a large ammunition supply is required for these weapons depending on the rate of fire several hundred to a thousand or more rounds could be necessary furthermore the recoil is very forceful and easily more than any person can handle in addition the power consumption of most modern systems require heavy power supplies for instance the m134 s 28v dc 115v ac electric motor can consume up to 130a at maximum the equivalent of multiple car batteries or a large portable generator gatling guns are often depicted in military themed films television programs and video games the accuracy of the depictions vary greatly ranging from impracticable hip firing of miniguns to conventional vehicle mounts in most depictions the power supply needed to run the external drive the external drive mechanism and the large ammunition supply are often not depicted in these fictional recreations video game depictions of the gatling gun also take creative liberties often depicting the weapon as taking an abnormally long time to spin up operating at a modest rate of fire having a tiny ammunition supply and suffering from overheating problems

 id=604026 title bowing social nonfiltered 426 processed 422 dbindex 1480429 for the use of the bow in musical instruments see bow music bowing is the act of lowering the head or sometimes the entire upper body from the waist as a social gesture this is common around the world but is especially prominent in oriental cultures especially in china korea and japan different cultures have placed varying degrees of importance on bowing and have used bowing in a variety of ways to show the highest degree of politeness you bend your head and waste about 45 degrees common courtesy to most people is shown by bending your head and waist about 15 degrees in a very casual meeting with a person about your age nodding your head would be enough people often bow while shaking hands with one or both hands in european cultures bowing is an exclusively male practice females perform a related gesture called a curtsey or curtsy as in asian cultures the depth of the bow expresses degree of respect or gratitude in european courtly circles males were expected to bow and scrape hence the term bowing and scraping for what appears to be excessive ceremony scraping refers to the drawing back of the right leg as one bows such that the right foot scrapes the floor or earth typically while executing such a bow the man s left hand is pressed horizontally across the abdomen while the right is held out from the body bowing originated as a gesture of subordination as lowering the head leaves the bower vulnerable this was particularly the case in asian cultures such as the samurai s tokugawa shogun period in japan this was the period of which samurais were at the height of a highly stratified society as they increasingly became courtiers bureaucrats and administrators rather than warriors bowing in east asia bows are the traditional greeting in east asia more so in korea and japan than anywhere else however bowing is not reserved only for greetings bowing is a gesture of respect different bows are used for apologies and gratitude to express different emotions humility sincerity remorse or deference and in various traditional arts and religious ceremonies basic bows are performed with the back straight and the hands at the sides boys and men or clasped in the lap girls and women and with the eyes down or closed bows originate at the waist generally the longer and deeper the bow the stronger the emotion bows can be generally divided into three main types informal formal and very formal informal bows are made at about a fifteen degree angle and more formal bows at about thirty degrees very formal bows are deeper there is an extremely complex etiquette surrounding bowing including the length and depth of bow and the appropriate response for example if the other person maintains his or her bow for longer than expected generally about two or three seconds it is polite to bow again upon which one may receive another bow in return this often leads to a long exchange of progressively lighter bows generally speaking an inferior bows longer and more deeply and more frequently than a superior bowing at school students at all levels of primary and secondary education must bow many times each day a typical class begins and ends with the students and teacher standing and bowing in unison to each other assemblies and club activities begin and end the same way at assemblies students generally must also bow to each teacher who speaks in front of the assembled school school ceremonies such as graduation welcome and farewell ceremonies and special gatherings follow the same pattern as well students will generally bow after speaking with a teacher in the staffroom in thanks or apology and particularly after being scolded in all but the most traditional schools bows among teachers of similar rank are somewhat less frequent except in thanks or apology but subordinate teachers will usually bow when speaking with superior teachers such as the vice principal and principal bows of apology and thanks bows are a required and expected part of any apology or expression of thanks in japan and korea and only parts of china bows of apology tend to be deeper and last longer than other types of bow they tend to occur with frequency during the apology generally at about 45 degrees with the head lowered and lasting for at least the count of three sometimes longer the depth frequency and duration of the bow increases with the sincerity of the apology and the severity of the offense bows of thanks follow the same pattern in extreme cases a kneeling bow is performed this bow is sometimes so deep that the forehead touches the floor this is called saikeirei in kanji and sebae in korean bows of apology are frequently performed at press conferences by high ranking members of a company that has performed some misdeed such as producing faulty parts that resulted in a death these bows are almost invariably performed standing behind a table the tips of the fingers touch the table while the upper body held straight is lowered from the waist until the face is parallel with the tabletop bows of greeting bows are commonly used in greeting both when meeting and when parting bows almost automatically accompany the greeting phrases but generally are no longer used among the immediate family unless addressing a family member after or in anticipation of a long absence or separation bows also replace speaking under certain circumstances for example when encountering again a person to whom one has already spoken that day a silent bow replaces such phrases as hello or hi a superior addressing an inferior will generally only nod the head slightly some people may not bow at all while an inferior will bend forward slightly from the waist bowing and shaking hands when dealing with non east asians many east asians will shake hands since many non east asians are familiar with the custom of bowing this often leads to a combined bow and handshake which can be quite complicated to execute bows may be combined with handshakes or performed before or after shaking hands generally when bowing in proximity to another as necessitated when combining bowing and shaking hands people turn slightly to one side usually the left to avoid bumping heads bowing in china bowing in china is not nearly so formalized as in japan and korea bowing is normally reserved for occasions such as funerals or ancestral worships only the kowtow is extremely rare among the chinese since the collapse of imperial china however in modern day china bowing is necessary for hangook people koreans living in the northern part of china vice versa for any chinese or japanese living in south korea a perfect example would be the community living in seoul city bowing in korea bowing in korean culture has different aspects to it than in other east asian cultures it is an especially integral part during martials arts religious services dedicated to the dead and formalized holidays unlike in the japanese tea ceremony a central approach to tea in korea is an easy and natural coherence with fewer formal rituals fewer absolutes greater freedom for relaxation and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas services and conversation as a result other than a bow of greeting and departure bowing is not an integral aspect of the korean tea ceremony bowing in japan bowing in japan is distinct from other east asian cultures when done in more traditional settings such as during a tea ceremony or during the beginning and end of a traditional martial arts match bowing in martial arts aikido kendo karate judo bowing is an integral part of traditional martial arts bows are used to begin and end practice sparring bouts and competitions and when entering and leaving the dojo or practice room this tends to be standard among practitioners in any country and is common also among the practitioners of martial arts originating from outside of japan such as taekwondo and kung fu but in japan other types of bow for example of thanks or apology are also standard in the dojo in traditional japan a bow in a kendo sword fight when one is defeated means a plea for beheading to save shame bowing in tea ceremony bowing is an important part of the japanese tea ceremony there are three main types of bow performed in a ceremony they are classified as shin gy and s all are usually performed from a kneeling position shin bows are the deepest from a kneeling position the bower bends forward from the waist placing the hands palms down on the floor in front of the body with the fingers facing shin bows are performed to teachers and superiors gy and s bows are less deep and less long gy bows are deeper from a kneeling position and bowing from the waist the hands are slid over the knees until the tips of the fingers touch the floor in front of the body they are performed among persons of similar rank students of tea ceremony bow to each other and to their teacher each class begins with bows between the teacher and students if a senior student is teaching a junior student bows are exchanged between the two before beginning a practice a student bows to all the other students as well this pattern is repeated when the practice ends a bow is performed at the door before entering the tea room or tea house one then proceeds to the tokonoma or scroll alcove and bows again finally one greets the teacher and then the other students or the other guests with bows this pattern is repeated when leaving the tea room as well the host of a tea cereomony bows before beginning the ceremony bows are exchanged repeatedly throughout a tea ceremony between the host and guest of honour among the guests between guests and the hosts assistants and between the host and guests bowing in religious settings bows are performed both in shinto and buddhist settings korean zen buddhism has a daily ritual in which practitioners do 1 080 full prostration bows usually spread throughout the day more casual practitioners and laypeople typically do 108 bows once a day instead visitors to a shinto shrine will clap or ring a bell to attract the attention of the enshrined deity clasp the hands in prayer and then bow for bowing in islam see ruk u bowing in christian liturgy in christian liturgy bowing is a sign of respect or deference in many traditions individuals will bow when passing in front of the altar or at certain points in the service for example when the name of jesus christ is spoken it may take the form of a simple bow of the head or a slight incline of the upper body a profound bow is a deep bow from the waist and is often done as a substitution for genuflection for bowing in eastern orthodoxy see zemnoy poklon bowing in jewish settings in jewish setting bowing like christianity is a sign of respect and is done at certain points in the jewish services this is done by merely bending the knees and then while straightening the knees bending the upper body forward after a few seconds the congregant returns to the standing position most importantly during the concluding aleinu section of the services congregants will bow when they say v anachnu korim umishtachavim u modim meaning we bend our knees bow and acknowledge our thanks another moment in the service which triggers the bow is during the bar

granted michael is learning spanish to grow closer to her unfortunately the one tape he could find spanish for businessmen is of little use to him buster is trying to get george michael to take over his role as adam this year which george michael is uninterested in doing until he receives a compliment from his secret crush maeby about the muscular shape the adam suit makes under his clothes simultaneously lindsay confronts michael about what lucille told her which wakes them both up to the fact that their mother is playing them against each other michael and lindsay proceed to drink a bottle of vodka and air their problems to each other lindsay tells michael that her marital difficulties are partly because tobias is a never nude and michael confesses to lindsay that he is in love with g o b s girlfriend marta george michael is still trying to show off his fake muscles for maeby who is still unable to make her parents notice her hints about running away just then tobias comes into their bedroom and asks to speak to george michael alone much to maeby s frustration tobias asks george michael if he can play adam in the pageant and george michael agrees but said he will have to give him the suit later since he is wearing it which tobias interprets to mean that george michael is also a never nude michael finally arranges a meeting with attorney wayne jarvis a professional who doesn t like small talk when lucille enters the office for the meeting she first tells michael that lindsay planned to get him drunk to get the money she needed for her credit card at home g o b

can t wait for the pageant your hopeful lawyer chides lucille about getting close to barry and tells her mother that the plan to drive a wedge between lindsay and michael isn t working to which lucille replies by telling lindsay that michael told her about tobias s never nude condition which lindsay had secretly confided to michael lindsay storms down to michael s office to berate him and they once again realize they have been played by their mother only this time they decide they have to teach her a lesson when michael finds out barry zuckerkorn is taking lucille to the living classics pageant on a date they realize how embarrassed she would be if george bluth sr finds out maeby meanwhile is trying a last ditch effort to get her parents attention by printing out a fake airline ticket to portugal and while neither lindsay nor tobias see the ticket g o b does which confirms his suspicions that michael is planning to flee the country and george michael begins to grow nervous about the pageant after realizing that playing adam means having to wear the frontispiece tiny foam genitalia george sr gets his 24 hours of freedom as the pageant finally begins michael and lindsay arrive and are surprised to find lucille accompanied by wayne jarvis not barry zuckerkorn lucille meanwhile is surprised to see buster with her rival lucille austero george michael causes a

chases after michael confronting him with his suspicions and all three knock each other onto the ground when george sr finds out lucille is on a date he tries to run back only to be tasered into submission by a prison guard and so the bluths spend christmas eve together at the prison where michael is forced to once again rely on barry lucille and maeby decide that they should spend more time together and michael and lindsay realize that perhaps keeping their friendship isn t as important as they thought episode notes although this episode comes before my mother the car in both broadcast and production order it appears after it on the season one dvd technically my mother the car should come first as buster and lucille austero start their relationship in that episode and go on their

painter paul gauguin callbacks running jokes barry is gay we are given the first hints that attorney barry zuckerkorn is secretly a practicing homosexual his numerous defamatory remarks about homosexuals indicate that barry is homophobic which sigmund freud claimed was a sign of repressed homosexuality when asking george sr about homosexual prisoners barry makes the freudian slip it s never the ones you hope corn dog this is the first time tobias is seen eating a corn dog another hint at his questionable sexuality which he later does again in let em eat cake he s very good throughout this episode lucille keeps saying he s very good about barry something that we later learn is a phrase that barry came up with to advertise himself this phrase is occasionally used in several later episodes including amigos and the righteous brothers we see an advertisement for barry on a park bench in this episode that reads he s very good this was paralleled in burning love when we see a spanish language park bench advertisement for barry reading es el mejor lesson maeby attempts many times during the first season to teach a lesson to her oblivious parents seen previously in pilot and key decisions never nude this is the first episode we learn about tobias s affliction and several references are made we see tobias demonstrating his affliction in several places such as a

dozens of us while defending george michael for wearing cut off jeans over his costume at the pageant party here we see another of lucille s many parties for the family this one celebrating christmas portugal this is the first time g o b displays his lack of knowledge about portugal saying that it is in south america additionally since the primary language of portugal is portuguese his logic regarding michael learning spanish to move there is somewhat flawed south america g o b assumes michael is running away to south america an idea he would decide to try himself in the next episode my mother the car the spanish language when g o b goes to leave marta s house she calls out te quiero which g o b asks for her to translate wig this is the first instance of george sr s tendency to

be done to help her case with sir horace rowland from the foreign office suggesting i am afraid that it is likely to go hard with miss cavell i am afraid we are powerless the sentiment was echoed by lord robert cecil who joined the coalition government in 1915 as an under secretary for foreign affairs after working for the red cross any representation by us he advised will do her more harm than good representing the united states which had not yet joined the war hugh gibson first secretary of the american legation at brussels made clear to the german government that executing cavell would further harm their nation s already damaged reputation in a statement issued afterward he noted we reminded him baron von der lancken of the burning of louvain and the sinking of the lusitania and told him that this murder would stir all civilized countries with horror and disgust count harrach broke in at this with the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see miss cavell shot than have harm come to one of the humblest german soldiers and his only regret was that they had not three or four english old women to shoot she made no defence admitting her actions and was executed by

 id=3862813 title partitas for keyboard 825 830 nonfiltered 461 processed 456 dbindex 1480464 the partitas for keyboard bwv 825 830 refer to a set of six suites written by the german composer johann sebastian bach for harpsichord and are the last of bach s 18 suites for keyboard the others being the 6 english suites bwv 806 811 and the 6 french suites bwv 812 817 background together the six partitas form an exciting and for the late baroque unique collection of keyboard pieces whilst many other composers were styling their works on more up to date fashions bach was adapting older formats assimilating a variety of styles and synthesising these into a collection that is remarkable for its diversity and originality despite being published separately between 1726 and 1730 it was not until 1731 that js bach published his six partitas as a collected edition under the now familiar title of clavierübung keyboard practice apart from two early mülhausen cantatas that were written for council elections they partitas were to become his first printed works of keyboard music their title consciously referring to the suites of bach s leipzig predecessor johann kuhnau 1660 1722 whose own clavier übung was published some years previously it was not for another four years before the second part of the clavierübung was published this time containing the italian concerto and the french ouverture each was an assimilation of the styles and tastes of their respective countries a third part followed in 1739 which consisted of an organ setting of the lutheran mass and its associated hymns before the production of the fourth and final volume in 1742 when bach returned to the harpsichord for the publication of his monumental work the goldberg variations although bach s later printed works were to be received somewhat coolly the partitas achieved a considerable acceptance amongst his contemporaries for example the musical scholar lorenz christophe mizler von kolof 1711 1778 commented that whoever does not know how to place his fingers better will only with difficulty learn to play at the keyboard passages of our celebrated herr bach of leipzig johann nikolaus forkel 1749 1818 bach s first biographer went further whoever learned to play well several pieces from this work could make his fortune in the world with them however the importance of the collection lays not so much in their difficulty but in a distinctive musical content that ranges from the elegance of the french style to the more up to date style galant it appears that seven partitas were planned initially again kuhnau set the precedence with his publications each of which contained seven suites although six was bach s preferred number for instrumental sets for example the brandenburg concertos the prefatory material to the initial publication of the fifth partita in 1730 indicated that another two were to follow the music and stylistic considerations their keys are arranged ingeniously spreading outwards from b flat major in a zigzag to c minor a minor d major g major and e minor which corresponds to the notes of the greek hexachord given this pattern one can speculate the key of the planned seventh partita was to be f major which is incidentally the key of the italian concerto that opens the second part of the clavierübung the partitas movements and sequencing are oriented towards the model of the french suite which following the examples of such composers as jean henri d anglebert and johann jakob froberger had become an established genre in germany by the beginning of the eighteenth century bach had used a similar format in his so called french suites bwv 812 817 the movements of which generally followed the following order allemande courante sarabande and gigue however many dance styles had changed considerably from the early french models favouring the more popular italian style instead thus we have more exciting courantes and gigues where subtlety becomes a casualty in favour of quicker models effused with sophisticated and in the words of some retrospective german counterpoint each also contains a large scale movement at its beginning again the precedence is french but the execution quintessentially bachian the suites of the french masters generally opened with a prélude non mesuré the harmonies of which were indicated in a series of metrically free semibreves without any formal rhythmic pattern the opening movement of the first partita a praeludium gives way to the short sinfonia of the second its heavily dotted rhythms recalling the french style a more subtle cantabile bicinium follows which in turn leads to a fugal two part invention the a minor fantasia of the third partita yields to the d major ouverture of the fourth in which bach s assimilation of a style made famous by lully manifests itself in a slow dotted introduction that is followed by a quick three part fugue the opening of the sixth partita also displays the same discretion where we have an italianate toccata in which four decorated and arpeggiated chords give way to a corrente like figure that is finally capped with a three part fugue a similar variety is also found in the other movements although the allemandes are written always as a serene movement in duple time they demonstrate differentiated rhythmic and metrical structures despite their conformity to a standard binary structure no two allemandes are alike each contains a subtle variety through its changing rhythmic and contrapuntal structure and in a departure from standard practice bach also varies their length and affekt since its original inception was as a piece for the keyboard in contrast to the other movements of the standard suite the structure of the allemande is afforded a much larger freedom of movement comment has already occurred concerning the italian nature of some of the courantes in fact only two of the partitas c minor and d major contain movements that conform to the french practices of alternating metres between 3 2 and 6 4 their style chosen to suit the french pretensions of their opening movements the remainder incline towards the corrente a more rapid movement in 3 8 or 3 4 especially in partitas 1 and 5 b flat and g major where they reflect the distinctly italianate nature of their introductions those of the a and e minor partitas suggest mixed forms the first an interplay between dotted rhythms and invention like bicinium counterpoint the second a play on syncopations in quavers a similar discretion to that used in the allemandes is also to be found in the sarabandes finally the gigues distinctly diverse in metre from one partita to the next employ the time signatures of c 12 8 9 16 6 8 and 4 2 the last is unusual since bach used an old fashioned metrical designation that was once reserved for triple time a split circle the gigue in the first partita distinctly modelled on the italian giga is non polyphonic in nature and consists of flowing triplets that outline the movement s harmonic progressions four are treated fugally with that of partita 5 g major becoming a complex double fugue in its second section the d major gigue partita 4 is much simpler but in the second half its counterpoint juxtaposes with the opening theme in the remainder of the gigues the theme of the second section mirrors the first although in the e minor one rather than being in the dominant it is retained inverted and in the tonic the remaining movements are not standardised the minuets follow discrete stylistic conventions those of the b flat major are distinctly italian in texture the d major is french whilst the g major has little in common with its designation tempo di menuetto since its rhythmic structure alternates freely between 3 4 and 6 8 the other dance movements included are the more conforming passepied and tempo di gavotta as well as movements of a more virtuose nature the burlesca scherzo rondeau and cappriccio on another level the partitas provide stimulus on an intellectual level through their proportions and design in which bach cleverly employs numerology the first two movements of the b flat major partita have 21 and 38 bars the ciphered numbers of b a c h where b the german label for b flat 2 a 1 c 3 h b natural 8 another important number one which appears constantly in the cantatas is 14 the sum of the four letters of his name thus the sarabande of the first partita contains 28 bars 2 x 14 and the important cadence in the sinfonia of partita 2 also lies at bar 28 the d major ouverture contains 112 bars 8 x 14 and the g major praeambulum in which the important fermata occurs at bar 86 8 6 14 has 95 bars 9 5 14 other numerological references are as follows rondeau in c 112 bars courante in a 56 bars

campaign in the fictional fantasy world of j r r tolkien the war of the ring is was fought between sauron and the free peoples of middle earth for control of the one ring and dominion over the continent it took place at the end of the third age together with the quest of mount doom it is one of the overarching events of the lord of the rings the war was initiated by sauron who had gained strength since the end of the second age and sought the one ring during the war of the ring many thousands of men of rohan and gondor were killed the overall number of combatants in the war is estimated to be over a million tens of thousands from the side of the free peoples and hundreds of thousands from the evil side the war also signified the decline of the elves power in middle earth the rise of men in the west the restoration of the king of gondor and arnor and the start of the fourth age battles were fought in gondor rohan lórien mirkwood at the lonely mountain and at dale these were primarily waged against sauron s forces but saruman a third contender also had armies who fought battles at the fords of isen and helm s deep the war ended after the battle of bywater and shortly afterwards the deaths of saruman and gríma wormtongue towards the end of the war of the ring elessar was crowned king of gondor and forgave the men who had fought under sauron heralding a great renewal of cooperation and communication between men elves and dwarves events southern theatre the objective of sauron s grand strategy was to defeat the strongest of the nations that opposed him gondor and to do so he would need to take the capital city and greatest fortress of gondor minas tirith to this end the war effort of mordor was focused in the south in and around gondor in a strategy of divide and conquer to keep gondor s ally rohan on its northern border from sending aid sauron promoted the rise of saruman at isengard to the west of rohan thus all of rohan s forces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide of the isengard attack and none would be sent to minas tirith s defence meanwhile sauron sent the mordor allied corsairs of umbar to attack gondor s populous southern coastal fiefs which as a result sent only a fraction of their forces to defend minas tirith in northern gondor while the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the corsair assault however sauron s divide and conquer strategy was ultimately foiled and a united front of gondor and rohan s forces faced mordor rohan although there had never really been peace the war of the ring started in rohan when saruman s troops crossed the fords of isen théodred the son of the king théoden had mustered his forces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the enemy on 23 february t a 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the orcs marching out of isengard reinforcements were quickly sent from isengard however and théodred ordered a retreat his forces retreated to an island in the fords but they were soon surrounded and he was killed grimbold managed to hold the island but would not have succeeded if elfhelm had not come with reinforcements from helm s deep thus the first battle of the fords of isen ended in defeat for the rohirrim now that the marshal of the westmark was dead erkenbrand took command of the westfold he placed grimbold and elfhelm at the fords however they were unable to withstand the force of isengard and were surrounded though they successfully broke through the enemy s lines they ended up scattered around the westfold giving saruman clear passage into rohan meanwhile gandalf drove gríma wormtongue out of edoras and went to gather erkenbrand s scattered forces advising king théoden to move to the stronghold of helm s deep the king and his forces arrived unmolested but soon the fortress was surrounded by saruman s troops the situation became desperate and at dawn the rohirrim attempted a break out unexpectedly gandalf arrived with erkenbrand and the scattered rohirrim along with a forest of huorns who had been sent to the battle by treebeard the orcs were trapped and utterly destroyed days before at an entmoot in fangorn forest the ents furious over the destruction saruman had wrought upon the forest decided to march on isengard they were to move up to isengard and destroy it by 3 march the destruction was completed and the command of isengard was taken by the ent treebeard at gandalf s request he sent a large herd of huorns to the battle of hornburg to aid the rohirrim gondor for over 3000 years the realm of gondor held back the shadow and the threat from the east in time the kingdom declined and sauron prepared to swoop in for the kill faramir captain of gondor had divided his forces to many fronts the two most important of these were in the island citadel of cair andros and the ruined city of osgiliath in a strict sense the war of the ring began with the great signal from minas morgul and the answering signal from mount doom and thus the attack on osgiliath was the first battle of the war proper sauron s two armies obliterated the fortresses and faramir was forced to retreat to the causeway forts the last defence against the morgul forces soon these too were destroyed and only minas tirith remained the attack soon began as the nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and confusion and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all destroyed the gate of minas tirith was broken and the lord of the nazgûl entered the first and only enemy to do so all seemed lost until six thousand rohirrim under king théoden s command came and somewhat relieved the gondorian defenders still the battle was in doubt until aragorn arrived with a large force out of south gondor the joint force of gondor and rohan then successfully defeated their enemies the battle of the morannon was the final major battle against sauron in the war of the ring fought at the black gate of mordor the army of the west roughly 6 000 strong led by aragorn marched on the gate and faced a vastly larger force as a diversionary feint to distract sauron s attention from frodo and sam who were carrying the one ring through mordor it was hoped that sauron would think aragorn had the ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow mordor despite the seemingly impossible odds the army of the west was eventually victorious when the ring was destroyed and sauron s forces fled or surrendered in dismay northern theatre mordor s war effort was focused in the south against gondor but using his outstretched right arm sauron attempted to flank the lands of the free peoples through the north using orcs and allied barbarian nations of men in this northern theatre of the war which had spread far across middle earth sauron s primary objective was to use the forces at his primary base of operations in the areas dol guldur in southern mirkwood to defeat lothlórien then pass the misty mountains attacking rivendell and wheel around to take rohan and gondor from the rear however dol guldur had to deal with the threat of the woodland realm of thranduil and thus split their forces between the attack on lothlórien and the one on the woodland realm sauron wanted to use his barbarian easterling allies in a joint attack with the orcs from dol guldur on the woodland realm and then have this victorious army link up with the other ones attacking lothlórien and defeat it however unfortunately for sauron a strong dwarf nation now existed at the lonely mountain thanks to the efforts of gandalf as well as the dwarves of the iron hills and allied men of dale mordor s easterling allies were tied up fighting the dwarves of erebor and men of dale and never linked up with the mordor forces assaulting the woodland realm which in turn could not link up with those attacking lothlórien and the line held bridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres of the war was the line of the river anduin between lothlórien and gondor running along the rohan border orc armies peeling off from the assault on lothlórien tried to enter rohan via this route while almost its entire army had left to fight at minas tirith but the ents of fangorn forest counterattacked and drove the orcs back in a panic and most if not all drowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river dale as the war begun the dwarves of erebor refused to co operate with sauron in his hunt for the ring therefore sauron sent an army of easterlings to dale on march 17 they met the armies of the dwarves and the men of dale after three days of fighting men and dwarves were overrun and sought refuge in erebor king brand of dale fell before the gate of erebor and king under the mountain dáin ii ironfoot fell as he was defending brand s body many men and dwarves made their escape to erebor however and were able to withstand the siege of the mountain fastness when news spread about the victory in the south the easterlings scattered and the sons of brand and dain let their army out of erebor lothlórien and mirkwood on march 11 lothlórien is first attacked from dol guldur it was attacked two further times on the 15 and the 22 when the dark lord had fallen celeborn led his army out of lórien and crossed the anduin dol guldur was captured and destroyed by galadriel thranduil of mirkwood was also attacked from dol guldur but in this the battle under the trees the elven folk won a hard victory after the destruction of dol guldur celeborn met thranduil on 6 april and as the shadow had passed they divided mirkwood and renamed it eryn lasgalen shire after the defeat of the dark lord saruman was released by treebeard he travelled to the shire where he replaced lotho sackville baggins as the chief under the name sharkey under his command ruffians entered the shire and ruined it they were defeated by hobbits under the lead of meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took merry and pippin in the battle of bywater on 3 november the hobbits headed to hobbiton where frodo ordered saruman and wormtongue to leave the shire wormtongue however killed saruman before he himself was killed by the hobbits with the death of saruman the war of the ring finally ended consequences the war of the ring had great influence on all of the lands of the northwest of middle earth most importantly it led to the restoration of the kingdoms of arnor and gondor as the reunited kingdom under king elessar telcontar the steward of gondor was dead but he was succeeded by his son faramir who kept the office and was given the title prince of ithilien in rohan the heir apparent théodred was killed and during the battle of pelennor fields king théoden died as well he was succeeded by his nephew éomer in the glittering caves at the hornburg a dwarven colony was established and isengard was given to the ents in dale both king brand and king dáin ii ironfoot were killed who were succeeded by their sons bard and thorin iii stonehelm they sent their emissaries to the crowning of elessar and were in alliance with gondor until their kingdoms ended for the elves the final decline had begun the bearers of the rings left middle earth and lórien was eventually abandoned in eryn lasgalen however thranduil s rule continued and they had peace there was also an elven colony in ithilien in the shire life continued as it had prior to the war it was declared a free land under the sceptre of annúminas and men were forbidden to enter it the westmarch was added to the shire by king elessar in 1452 s r once the fourth age began the elves stopped having an active influence on the affairs of middle earth having started fading away ever since the third the orcs never became a serious threat again reduced to small bands of mountain brigands they were never more than a nuisance adaptations there are several games that are named after the novel the games workshop 2005 summer online campaign for the lord of

 id=1633733 title species richness nonfiltered 478 processed 473 dbindex 1480481 species richness is the simplest measure of biodiversity and is simply a count of the number of different species in a given area it is referred to in equations as in order to account for the probability of missing some of the actual total number of species present in any count based on a sample population the jackknife estimate may be employed s n n 1 n k where s species richness n total number of species present in sample population k number of unique species of which only one organism was found in sample population similarly the equation may also be noted as s e k n 1 n where e the summation of number of species in each sample k number of rare unique species n number of sample as well when looking at local diversity the appropriate formula to use is s caz where c a specific number for each taxa a the area of study z the slope perimeter reasons of being commonly used practical application it is proven that species richness is measurable in practice it is one of the two components of the ecosystem s species diversity existing information a huge amount of information of pattern of species richness exists this information can be found in academic literature further information on species richness can be extracted from different kinds of database such as museums surrogary species richness has been found to be a good surrogate for other measures of biodiversity that would be more difficult to be measured directly as species richness is positively correlated with some measures wide application species richness has been widely applied in practical management legislation and political discourse factors affect species richness there is a strong inverse correlation in many groups between species richness and latitude the farther from the equator the fewer species can be found even when compensating for the reduced surface area of the globe in higher latitudes equally as altitude increases species richness decreases indicating an effect of area available energy isolation and or zonation intermediate elevations can receive species from higher and lower latitude latitudinal gradient see also rapoport s rule and latitudinal gradients in species diversity the species richness increase from high latitudes to the low latitudes the peak of the species richness is not at equator however it is deducted that the peak is between 20 30 n the gradient of species richness is asymmetrical about the equator the level of species richness increase rapidly from the north region but decrease slowly from the equator to southern region area effect the latitudinal gradients of the species richness may result from the effect of area the area at lower latitudes is larger than that at higher latitudes leading to higher species richness at lower latitudes productivity the latitudinal gradients of species richness may be result from the energy available to the ecosystems at lower latitudes there are higher amounts of energy available because of more solar radiation more resources for example minerals and water as a result higher levels of species richness can be allowed at lower latitudes area the relationship between species richness and area is commonly approximated as following equation or where s is the number of species reflect the species richness a is the area and z and c are constants the above relation explains the variation of species richness among different areas sampling species richness may not really relate to the area size but the statistical artefact more species can be recorded may just because more samples are collected in larger area habitat diversity it is possible that larger area contain more habitats as it is said that larger area is more topographically and environmentally diverse therefore there are more opportunities for more species to set up their populations due to higher habitat diversity relationship between endemism and species richness the levels of endemism and that of species richness are frequently positive correlated however in some oceanic islands there is high levels of endemism but the levels of species richness are quite low other methods for measuring biodiversity other measures of biodiversity may also take into account the rarity of the taxa and the amount of evolutionary novelty they embody weakness as a measure of biodiversity species richness suffers from the lack of a good definition of species there are at least 7 definitions with their own strength and weakness still it is easy to measure and is well studied species richness fails to take into consideration species evenness other measures of biodiversity such as the simpson index the shannon wiener index and the fundamental biodiversity parameter of the unified neutral theory of biodiversity take species evenness into consideration references kevin j gaston john i spicer 2004 biodiversity an introduction

palace of neustria and the leader of the faction of austrasian great nobles in the struggles for hegemony over the waning merovingian dynasty his torture and death made him a martyr and saint of the roman catholic church which embraced the cause of the austrasian mayors of the palace the arnulfings in the following century anointed as the carolingian dynasty leodegar son of bobilo and sigrada later a nun at soissons was of high rank among the frankish nobility his brother was the comes gaerinus warin according to the liber historiae francorum leodegar as befitted his rank was raised in paris at the court of clotaire ii king of all the franks and educated at the palace school at about the age of twenty he went to poitiers where there was a long established cathedral school to study under the guidance of his uncle desiderius dido the bishop who ordained him archdeacon and associated him in the government of the diocese in or about 650 after he became a priest and with the bishop s recommendation leodegar was made abbot of the monastery of st maxentius saint maixent in poitou at the abbey he introduced the benedictine rule one of his vitae relates in 656 about the time of the usurpation of grimoald in austrasia and the banishment of the boy heir dagobert ii leodegar was called to the neustrian court by the widowed queen bathilde to assist in the government of the united kingdoms and in the education of her children then in 659 he was named to the see of autun in burgundy he again undertook the work of reform and held a council at autun in 661 to denounce manichaeism and was the first to adopt the stringently trinitarian athanasian creed he made reforms among the secular clergy and in the religious communities and had three baptisteries erected in the city the church of saint nazaire was enlarged and embellished and a refuge established for the indigent leodegar also caused the public buildings to be repaired and the old roman walls of autun to be restored his authority at autun placed him as a leader among the franco burgundian nobles meanwhile in 660 the austrasian nobles demanded a king and young childeric ii was sent to them through the influence of ebroin the mayor of the palace in neustria the queen withdrew from the court that was ebroin s in all but name to an abbey she had founded at chelles near paris on the death of clotaire iii in 673 a dynastic struggle ensued with rival claimants as pawns ebroin raised theoderic to the throne but leodegar and the other bishops supported the claims of his elder brother childeric ii who by the help of the austrasians and burgundians was eventually made king ebroin was interned at luxeuil and theoderic sent to st denis leodegar remained at court guiding the young king in 673 or 675 however leodegar was also sent to luxeuil the cause a protest against the marriage of childeric and his first cousin is a hagiographic convention as a leader of the austrasian and burgundian nobles leodegar was easily represented as a danger by his enemies when childeric ii was murdered at bondi in 673 by a disaffected frank theoderic iii was installed as king in neustria making leudesius his mayor leodegar and ebroin each took advantage of the chaos to make his escape from luxeuil and hasten to the court in a short time ebroin caused leudesius to be murdered and became mayor once again still leudegar s implacable enemy about 675 the duke of champagne and the bishops of chalons and valence stirred up by ebroin attacked autun and leodegar fell into their hands at ebroin s instigation his eyes were gouged out and the sockets cauterized and his tongue was cut out some years later ebroin persuaded the king that childeric had been assassinated at the instigation of leodegar the bishop was seized again and after a mock trial was degraded and condemned to further exile at fécamp in normandy near sarcing he was led out into a forest by ebroin s order and murdered a dubious testament drawn up at the time of the council of autun has been preserved as well as the acts of the council a letter which he caused to be sent to his mother after his mutilation is likewise extant in 782 his relics were translated from the site of his death sarcing in artois to the site of his earliest hagiography the abbey of st maxentius saint maixent near poitiers later they were removed to rennes and thence to ebreuil which place took the name of saint léger in his honour some relics are still kept in the cathedral of autun and the grand séminaire of soissons in 1458 cardinal rolin caused his feast day

 id=6438447 title modular connector nonfiltered 512 processed 507 dbindex 1480516 modular connector is the name given to a family of electrical connectors examples of which are pictured these connectors were originally used in telephone wiring and are still prevalent for that but are used for a variety of other things a modular connector s advantage over many other kinds of connectors is its small size and ease of plugging and unplugging many uses that originally used a bulkier connector have migrated to modular connectors probably the most well known applications of modular connectors is for telephone jacks and for ethernet jacks which are nearly always modular connectors the modular connector was first used in the registered jack system so there are precise specifications of them within the registered jack specifications those are the specifications to which all practical modular connectors are built however the registered jack specifications don t name the physical connectors instead these are covered by iso standard 8877 first used in isdn systems modular connectors have gender the male connector is called a plug while the female connector is called a jack or sometimes a socket modular connectors come in four sizes 4 6 8 and 10 position a position is a place that can hold a conductor pin the positions need not all be used a connector can have any even number of conductors unused positions are usually the outermost positions the connectors are designed so that a plug can fit into any jack that has at least the number of positions as the plug where the jack has more positions than the plug the outermost positions are unused however plugs from different manufacturers may not have this compatibility and some manufacturers of eight position jacks now explicitly warn that they are not designed to accept smaller plugs without damage some connector types in the family are indexed which means their shape is altered from the standard somewhat to prevent them from mating with standard connectors the indexing is usually a different shape or position of the hook but can also be an additional tab the members of the family are typically identified using the format pc e g 6p2c which means 6 positions 2 conductors alternate formats x e g 6x2 or e g 6 2 are also used modular connectors lock together a spring loaded tab called a hook on the plug snaps into a jack so that the plug cannot be pulled out to remove the plug you have to press the hook the most common way to install a jack in a wall or panel is with the hook side down this usually makes it easier to operate the hook when removing the plug because the person grabs the plug with thumb on top and presses the hook with the index finger the positions of a jack are numbered left to right looking into the receiving side of the jack with the hook side down starting at 1 the positions of plug are numbered the same as the jack positions with which they mate the number of a conductor is the same as the number of the position it s in so for example in a 6p2c plug only conductors 3 and 4 exist the pinouts assignment of function to each conductor are as varied as are the applications of modular connectors even within the same application there is often little standardization for example there are multiple conventions for use of 8p8c for rs 232 as a result when you buy a de9 8p8c adapter it usually comes without the pins installed you insert them according to the particular standard you re using the telephone pinouts are well standardized as the registered jack system the ethernet pinouts are also well standardized as tia eia 568 b the application of jack versus plug is generally based on physical installation only jacks go in walls and panels while plugs go on wires this is in contrast to some other connector systems where the gender is related to the function of the connector e g in a power cabling system a female connector delivers power while a male connector receives power extension cables male on one end female on the other are rarely seen instead people use male male cables and female female couplers modular connectors also go by the names modular phone jack plug rj connector and western jack plug the 8p8c modular connector type is often called rj45 but the name rj45 is also used for something quite different the modular connector moniker is not terribly descriptive but arose from its original use in a novel system of cabling designed to make telephone systems more modular modular connectors were originally invented and patented by bell telephone laboratories patent filed 6 july 1973 issued 14 january 1975 and replaced the hard wired connections on most western electric telephones around 1976 at the same time they began to replace screw terminals and large 3 and 4 pin jacks in buildings a disadvantage of modular connectors is that the fragile hook on a plug easily snags and often breaks when you try to pull a cord through other cords and other obstructions some higher quality cables have a flexible sleeve called a boot over the plug or a special hook design to prevent this boots are seen mainly on 8p8c data cables endofarticle doc doc

resource for anyone interested in how shakespeare s plays have been transformed and adapted in canada the canadian adaptations of shakespeare project is an integrated virtual learning teaching and research commons devoted to the study of shakespeare in canada the launch of its website marked the first stage of an intensive collaborative research effort whose next phase will involve the establishment of the centre for canadian shakespeare studies online at the university of guelph plans include further digitization of casp s extensive archival holdings currently casp has been able to digitize less than 10 of what it holds in its hard copy archives the full bilingualization of the site french english and the creation of learning modules for all educational levels based on the materials archived to the site casp is the first research project of its kind anywhere in the world devoted to the systematic exploration and documentation of the ways in which shakespeare has been adapted into and out of a national multicultural theatrical practice and is now recognized as the largest and most sophisticated website in the world devoted to shakespeare one of the defining features of canada s cultural theatrical heritage is the extent to which it relies on a dialogue with traditional shakespearean theatre developed by the university of guelph s canadian adaptations of shakespeare project casp directed by dr daniel fischlin school of english and theatre studies the site houses an as close to comprehensive and ever growing digital archive of performances productions playwrights and other materials that date from pre canadian confederation times to the present day included in the casp list of playwrights are such names as timothy findley ann marie macdonald djanet sears daniel david moses rick miller and robert lepage all told at launch time april 2004 the casp website contained well over seven thousand pages of information on over 450 plays which will be added to as the project continues casp is actually two integrated websites one an administrative database site the other the public site that is connected to portions of the database casp is unique in how it has developed an innovative research mechanism that allows for inputting of research results from anywhere in the world through its administrative database site something casp conceptualized and designed from the ground up its innovative ongoing research activities have already attracted national and international media recognition including feature write ups in the globe and mail caldwell when pucks collide the chronicle of higher education birchard u of guelph unveils largest website on shakespeare national radio and television interviews and the visits of many international scholars working on related materials the project website to which many of casp s findings have been published has generated a huge volume of site visits since the launch of the site in april 2004 currently the site is developing bilingual materials related to french canada and shakespeare with an intended launch in summer of 2006 these materials will effectively double the size of what is already a massive site with enormous resources including scripts critical writings images audio film and various multimedia including a soon to be released shakespeare literacy game targeted at a youth audience further the signing of the recent memorandum of understanding with the stratford festival of canada april 2005 after more than a year of negotiation and design articulates a move toward a hybrid site co developed with stratford intended launch date january 2007 that will combine casp s intepretative critical and archival expertise with stratford s performance focus to create a major new site devoted to shakespeare and pedagogy the site will be housed at the university of guelph the vision is to create the most sophisticated learning commons in the world devoted to shakespearean pedagogy with a focus on performance and cultural and linguistic literacy the casp project which includes both the public web site and hard copy archives of all the plays and play materials it catalogues has been funded by a premier s research excellence award prea provided by the province of ontario and by a social sciences and humanities research council standard research grant for better or worse canada s theatrical past is profoundly connected to shakespeare with productions revisions adaptations and any number of spin off representations a key feature of the canadian cultural landscape as stated in the canadian theatre encyclopedia entry on shakespeare the most produced non canadian playwright his works are at the foundation of theatre in this country and are performed in all styles at virtually all the major theatres in french and in english across the nation like molière the works of shakespeare appear as keystones throughout the history of theatre here canada his were among the first works performed in the new world they were the raison d être of the foundation of the nation s largest theatre stratford festival and they are still being taught in schools with interpretations which change from era to era shakespeare canadian theatre encyclopedia as much as this shakespearean presence is a function of canada s colonial heritage with its dependency on immigrant cultures it is also a function of how a new and emergent culture has sought to define itself in dialogue and frequently against the shakespearean tradition casp is an attempt to document the fascinating permutations this dialogue has taken with the understanding that shakespeare or the shakespeare effect is situated at a key nexus in a wide array of cultural activities and referents moreover canadian scholarship has played a crucial role in providing the necessary social historical economic religious and archival contexts for understanding the theatrical work shakespeare produced the records of early english drama project housed at the university of toronto for instance provide proof that a man like shakespeare without a university education untrained in the classical theatre tradition of the time unacquainted with the manners of aristocracy actually could have written the plays that are now universally regarded as the greatest in drama and literature monika stephenson canadian scholarship gives the bard a boost the globe and mail may 1 2004 f9 casp was conceived as an attempt to produce an archive of lost or forgotten theatrical materials and practices important both to canada s theatrical and literary histories but also to canada s emergent sense of itself as a nation as mediated by these same materials and practices to that end we have collected information on over 450 plays in which some form of shakespearean adaptation is at work these plays span hundreds of years over three centuries in chronology and document a vast range of local regional national transnational and multicultural theatrical realities that form a significant part of canada s cultural heritage the sheer quantity of theatrical activity occurring in the genre of shakespearean adaptation over an extended historical period marks a significant economic artistic cultural and social investment in doing something to with shakespeare casp notes that this activity is over and above the theatrical work in which more conventional stagings and productions of shakespeare occur themselves always potentially adaptations moreover these adaptations if anything reinforce the crucial linkage between works of the imagination and the political and social contexts out of which they emerge as jane henderson suggests in a recent online article linking shakespeare to canadian politics especially in relation to issues of marriage and domesticity both art and politics are putting out ideas about the same thing namely they are imagining how people could identify and organize their experiences of attraction and devotion shakespeare s text is an inherited institution as is the canadian federal definition of terms of marriage paul martin meet shakespeare such an association is but one of a multiple set of intersections between theatrical activity that uses shakespeare as a key framing device and the wider cultural patternings and activities to which shakespearean adaptation is pertinent shakespeare s use of a wide variety of adaptive techniques and source texts in his theatrical writing and the recent explosion of shakespearean adaptation studies also provide an important context for understanding the impetus behind casp the diversity of shakespearean adaptation in canada is staggering from aboriginal and african canadian theatre through to colonial postcolonial fringe multicultural minority popular culture gay lesbian queer and youth theatre the casp digital archive includes adaptations with a range of thematic predilections from cowboy shakespeare to vampire shakespeare to club rave and dj shakespeare to hockey shakespeare to theatresports shakespeare to shakespeare and the october crisis of 1970 in response to this diversity the casp website was designed to have multiple uses for a range of audiences from students and teachers looking for access to classroom materials through to playgoers and theatre practitioners looking for production details and other sorts of information the casp site collects materials with inclusiveness as a key operating principle materials made available on the casp website represent only a small portion of the materials collected in a hard copy archive housed in the casp offices at the university of guelph it is casp s intention to digitize as many of these materials as possible in the future a number of features make the casp site unique the casp online anthology consisting of over 35 texts most of them playscripts is the first of its kind and completely free to anyone with access to a web browser making accessible a variety of canadian playscripts and historical texts that have been either lost or unavailable until now for instance casp published for the first time john wilson bengough s puffe and co or hamlet prince of dry goods a comic play by canada s internationally famous cartoonist that had been lost for over a century a substantial portion of the materials gathered in the casp archives are distinctive critically unrecognized virtually unknown or unpublished using the technical expertise of programmers working for the university of guelph casp built an online database designed specifically for recording literary and theatrical information it is fully searchable and contains significant amounts of data on playwrights productions of plays awards historical context digital links and information and so forth that is constantly being updated the content of this database is unique no other database of its sort exists anywhere casp also developed a spotlight page that allowed it to digitize and organize materials from within its archives as a special focus section thus providing access to a focussed grouping of materials that will be useful in a range of pedagogical contexts the first spotlight page launched by casp was aboriginal adaptations of shakespeare the information in the casp online anthology and database is complemented by links to a range of secondary sources and multimedia materials casp has digitally recorded and transcribed exclusive interviews done with a variety of playwrights and have made them available online it has also included clips from movies photos political cartoons in which shakespearean referents figure rare historical documents like the first program for the stratford festival in stratford ontario and where possible other relevant audiovisual materials casp trains and funds in a collaborative research context undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs at the university of guelph s school of english and theatre studies sets many of its trainees go on to do further graduate work in the field there are currently 4 casp graduates completing phds in overlapped areas of study casp has trained and employed some 35 graduate and undergraduate students and has employed close to 50 people in a variety of functions since its inception casp is currently one of the largest digital humanities research

 id=4376268 title south australian general election 1997 nonfiltered 536 processed 530 dbindex 1480541 legislative elections for state parliament were held in south australia on 11 october 1997 background following the 1993 landslide to the liberal party the labor party led by mike rann held just 11 seats in the house of assembly the liberals held 36 seats and there were no independent or minor party members in the house of assembly they had held a record 37 but lost one in a by election in 1994 however the liberals had internal tensions and john olsen had successfully challenged dean brown for the leadership of the liberal party in 1996 and had been premier of south australia for around 12 months on election day the margin of 25 seats was seen as insurmountable for the labor party despite the liberal leadership change the election was held just after the end of the football season when the state had been captivated by the adelaide crows unexpectedly winning the afl premiership leaving only one week for campaigning uninterrupted by football this was expected to work in the government s favour though it seems it had the opposite effect on february 6 2007 mike rann told parliament that some in the liberal party had leaked information to him before and during the election campaign the following quote by rann is from hansard on 6 2 2007 you asked me a question and i will give you a 55 minute answer because you will remem ber one day when i came into this place and i had i think 880 pages of cabinet and other documents i remember being telephoned and told to go to a certain cafe not in a white car but in a taxi and then to walk in a zigzag fashion through the streets of a suburb where i was to be handed cabinet documents so much for their cabinet solidarity and cabinet confidentiality there was a queue on the telephone telling us what had happened the day before it was the same during the 1997 election campaign people thought how does this guy the leader of the opposition at the time know intuitively exactly what john olsen is doing the next day it was because i was being phoned and told so do not talk to me about cabinet solidari ty lest i come in here and start naming names which will set off another generation of disputation on the other side of the house anyway cabinet approved among other things on 20 december 2006 minister lomax smith s proposed statement and approved her to announce publicly that she opposed the proposal in cabinet she did so because we agreed that she should be able to do so somehow i do not think that john olsen agreed to what happened when i was getting the phone call at 6 o clock in the morning and at midnight and walking in a zigzag pattern through suburbs to be handed a cabinet bag and cabinet documents we have a different approach we agreed to it it was a cabinet decision to agree to it so please ask me some more questions because there were two different camps involved in this leaking to the then poor unpopular leader of the opposition and i am more than happy to name names election procedure under its state constitution south australia holds legislative elections approximately every four years the electoral act stipulates that the election campaign must run for a minimum of 25 days and a maximum of 55 days in accordance with electoral regulations the electoral commissioner then advertised key dates for this election of all 47 members of the house of assembly and eleven members of the legislative council close of rolls nominations polling day return of writs house of assembly results to the surprise of most observers the labor party polled exceptionally well gaining 10 seats and coming within a couple of seats of winning government the liberals lost a massive 13 seats 10 to labor one to the nationals and two to conservative independents so the numbers were liberal 23 seats labor 21 nationals 1 karlene maywald and two conservative independents mitch williams and rory mcewen this left the liberals one short of a majority though they had the support of the national and independents and williams later joined the liberal party post election pendulum legislative council results in the legislative council voter disquiet was reflected in the fact that 3 of the 11 candidates were from minor parties with the australian democrats having two mlcs elected for the first time elected were 4 liberal 4 labor 2 australian democrats and no pokies candidate nick xenophon carrying over from the 1993 election were 6 liberal 4 labor 1 democrat leaving the numbers at 10 liberal 8 labor 3 democrats 1 no pokies both on 1 72 the hemp legalise marijuana party received 15432 votes and the sa greens received 15377 votes legacy the 1997 result put labor within striking distance of winning government at the next election in 2002 john olsen was left with internal disquiet over the leadership challenge and poor election result while his opponent mike rann was seen to

villages in illinois indiana and wisconsin to be chosen by the united states olympic committee as the official united states bid for the international olympic committee 2016 summer olympics host city competition on july 26 2006 the usoc had narrowed its list of candidates to chicago and los angeles san francisco dropped out in november 2006 it should be noted that chicago has the dubious distinction of being the only city to have had an olympics taken away the 1904 summer olympics were originally supposed to be held in chicago but were moved to st louis to coincide with the 1904 world s fair united states olympic committee the usoc s chairman peter ueberroth visited potential host cities during the month of may 2006 ueberroth and his party visited chicago on may 10 plan chicago mayor richard m daley was officially welcomed in beijing by the government of the people s republic of china during the week of may 15 2006 when the mayor discussed chicago s venture he is the only mayor of an american city vying for the 2016 summer olympics to have been welcomed to beijing on official olympic business chicago s chances for hosting the 2016 summer olympics are bolstered by preliminary commitments made by major corporations and wealthy chicago philanthropists promised participation in the planning process by community and government leaders including the chairman of the illinois republican party a political party usually opposed to daley and the enthusiasm of the citizenry opinion polls conducted by local newspapers in early 2006 suggested that public support for the 2016 summer olympics in chicago could be as high as 80 to 85 percent most importantly the city s existing infrastructure and venue options are considerably more substantial than the offerings available in other interested cities bob ctvrtlik part of the initial assessment team said it s got all the amenities that would make this a wonderful experience for our athletes ueberroth added chicago is going in the right direction and we are impressed by that financing ueberroth and members of the national committee met with daley on may 10 2006 for the initial assessment on the same day with permission from ueberroth daley appointed business executive patrick g ryan of aon corporation and part owner of the chicago bears to lead the city s bid process especially in areas of corporate participation in fundraising in previous years daley opposed possible bids for the 2008 and 2012 olympic games owing to former international committee financial guarantee requirements those requirements have been relaxed in favor of a new philosophy in which the olympic games would become smaller in terms of construction and related costs early cost estimates hover at 5 billion with 1 billion needed for a new olympic stadium in chicago venues despite the need for an olympic stadium chicago has dozens of existing sport venues soldier field united center u s cellular field wrigley field allstate arena in rosemont sears centre in hoffman estates and the new toyota park in bridgeview venues at loyola university chicago northwestern university the university of chicago the university of illinois at chicago and northern illinois university among others are also available and have been mentioned in early news reports as possibilities navy pier and the lakefront could host all beach and water events other regional mayors have offered venues in indiana and wisconsin including use of the university of notre dame facilities stadium chicago initially proposed building a temporary 80 000 seat stadium adjacent to soldier field to act as the main stadium hosting the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the track and field events previously according to the chicago tribune mayor daley had expressed a desire for an additional nfl franchise to come to chicago in order to obtain the 80 000 seat stadium needed to host an olympics the plan has since been revised to include a 95 000 seat stadium inside washington park on the south side of the city after the games it would be converted to a 10 000 seat track and field venue that could also host other events chicago s reputation as a major convention hosting center will also help its cause the main convention center mccormick place is the largest convention center in the united states and is undergoing an expansion that will be completed in 2007 the city of chicago has over 50 000 hotel rooms in the immediate downtown area and has the largest skilled labor workforce in the u s catering to conventions

best sports city by the sporting news chicagoans are famous for their rabid support of their home teams the chicago bears chicago blackhawks chicago cubs chicago white sox the chicago bulls and more recently the chicago fire other events such as the chicago marathon one of the largest marathon events worldwide will also play a part in chicago s olympic planning process experience chicago successfully hosted the international gay games vii from july 15 to july 22 2006 one of the first tests to measure olympic host city viability chicago has hosted major and historic world gatherings in the past including the famous 1893 columbian exposition the 1933 world s fair the 1959 pan american games as well as matches for the 1994 fifa world cup soccer tournament chicago was supposed to host the 1904 summer olympics but these were removed from the city and given to saint louis to coincide with its louisiana purchase exposition more commonly known as the saint louis world s fair chicago has never been happy with its distinction as one of the few cities to have an olympic games taken away and this historical issue could play to chicago s favor chicago was also the first host of the special olympics in 1968 miscellaneous it is expected that chicago s world class architecture renowned skyline multi cultural historical and pop cultural contributions will be positive factors as the olympics bid is weighed chicago s geographic location also counts in its favor its central position within the united states means that its time zone is well suited to american television coverage the nbc television network and its sister cable broadcasters under the nbc universal banner is by far the largest media vendor and contract purchaser of the olympic games michael jordan has become an unofficial spokesman for chicago s bid recent developments on june 23 2006 five united states candidates met in california to offer official presentations to the usoc board of directors chicago tribune reported of the event on june 24 usoc officials indicated they could whittle down the field of five contenders in as soon as three weeks the article also stated observers say it s likely to be a three way horse race between san francisco chicago and olympic veteran los angeles as predicted the usoc on july 26 2006 officially named san francisco los angeles and chicago as the three us finalists for the 2016 olympics dropping philadelphia and houston however on november 13 2006 san francisco withdrew its bid from the national selection process leaving chicago and los angeles as the only contenders in the u s bid the chicago 2016 exploratory committee has launched its official web site at www chicago2016 org on september 21 2006 mayor daley unveiled a revised plan for the main stadium which would host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as track and field events the plan calls for a 95 000 seat stadium to be constructed in washington park on chicago s south side the plan s preliminary design mimics the 1893 world s columbian exposition making use of the midway plaisance and the surrounding neighborhoods of hyde park and woodlawn the stadium would be temporary and would be mostly dismantled into a 10 000 seat track and field stadium and event complex after the games according to the chicago sun times local aldermen strongly support this plan on january 9th the usoc announced that they will go forward in presenting an american bid to the international competition for the 2016 games the next step was for the city of los angeles and chicago to have a bid book

globe from asia and the far east to africa and latin america biographical information dr chandler was born on june 22 1907 in ohio grew up in maine and earned a 1934 ph d from the university of maryland he passed away on march 23 1999 at the age of 91 in a scientific and administrative career that spanned seventy years he inspired scores of young and talented scientists to work for the betterment of human nutrition and improved rural income many of his protégés advanced to become leaders in agricultural research dr chandler was remembered by fellow world food prize laureate dr m s swaminathan as a scientist of vision and conviction warmth and wisdom and of great inner strength the impact of his leadership and dynamism was widely felt in asia within a short period academic and research career originally a professor of forest soils at cornell university dr chandler was in 1946 named director of agricultural research at the university of new hampshire and from 1950 to 1954 served as that institution s president during that time he also studied soils in mexico where from 1954 to 1958 he directed research for the rockefeller foundation founding director of irri by the late 1950s the population of asia was expanding rapidly and the outlook for feeding the increasing number of people was bleak many experts predicting that the region would outgrow its food production capacities by 1975 warned of chronic widespread famine this was the situation when dr chandler became the founding director of the international rice research institute irri in los baños the philippines his experience in science and administration made him a natural choice to initiate the irri program in 1959 which he and his wife sunny did with little more than a typewriter in a manila hotel room from the outset dr chandler knew that the production of rice the primary staple for more than four fifths of asia s population would play a paramount role in curtailing hunger to keep pace with the growing population however rice production had to increase by more than five million tons annually dr chandler brought together a staff of administrators and attracted top scientists from around the globe unified in their focus on the agricultural needs of the developing world concentrating on collecting existing asian rice breeds and genetically improving them they produced varieties specially developed to have double and triple the yield potential of traditional rice plants as early as 1963 irri researcher and 1996 world food prize laureate henry beachell had already identified the plants that would become the ir8 strain lauded as miracle rice these and other varieties developed at irri brought a 66 increase in rice production in asia while the population rose 47 today the new rice varieties are grown on 500 000 km² across the continent in reality the rapid advances in rice production that dr chandler and his eminent staff made were not a miracle but the product of hard work determination and years of research the success of dr chandler s work with irri spurred the development of an international network of agricultural research centers supported by the consultative group on international agricultural research sixteen centers are currently located on nearly every continent each focusing on particular crops livestock or problems in food production after guiding irri through its first decade dr chandler become the founding director of the asian vegetable research and development center avrdc in taiwan in 1972 under his leadership avrdc developed vegetable varieties for the tropics including a heat tolerant tomato with a yield of 20 tons per hectare for more than 30 years avrdc varieties have enriched the diets of millions of people especially women and children suffering from a lack of micronutrients and the center maintains dr chandler s founding mission in its outreach activities across asia and africa and in central america after retiring from full time work in 1975 dr chandler continued his mission through consultant assignments with the near east foundation the rockefeller and ford foundations the us agency for international development usaid and the world bank he received the presidential end hunger award in 1986 which cited his continued demonstrated vision initiative and leadership in the effort to achieve a world without hunger honors and recognition in 1966 the indian council of agricultural research honored dr chandler s contribution to irri s achievements stating his own personal qualities as a critical scientist and a dynamic leader have been primarily responsible for the emergence of the international rice research institute as the finest rice research center in the world his contributions therefore lie not only in the practical application of science for human welfare but in the evolution of a pattern of research administration conducive to science becoming an instrument of social progress in the developing nations dr s k dedatta an irri agronomist from 1964 to 1991 credited dr chandler for his commitment to and leadership in staving off hunger in asia saying researchers brains were the only limitations at irri in the early days the countries that most immediately and directly benefited from dr chandler s vision were quick to laud his efforts he was honored with india s gold medal award in 1966

victory in the 24 hours of le mans but road cars were by invitation only only 5 road going gt1s were made and used ironically mostly for racing with one saved for the porsche museum the sale of the

continues to make appearances in the uk arash turned his mind to a more marketable car and hired a stylist fresh out of school to help him develop a compact supercar formed around the same drivetrain the resulting prototype the gts was a compact car with a steel tube frame with carbon fibre body panels pushrod suspension with öhlins dampers and with power expected to be available up to 580 hp at

the farboud supercar company was started in 2004 it is believed the gts was too big of a project for so small and expensive a team farboud had hired ex mtm engine tuners and ex lotus chassis engineers

marsh had experience working on the marcos and invicta british sports cars and was especially attracted to the farboud for the unusually warm public reception to its looks and was excited about how to bring the gts to market profitably with the aim of maintaining the looks of the gts and the expected performance marsh is rumored to have addressed some sore points such as the low windshield header

in mid 2006 arash published sketches for their new car the arash af10 based on the graphics released the car looks similar to the enzo ferrari but powered by a corvette v8 engine the af10 is priced at 170 000 apiece about 1 3rd of the enzo s list price although the original sketches have been compared to the enzo a mock up of the proposed shape showed an evolution away from the sketches in order to

 id=2730366 title esperanto and ido compared nonfiltered 578 processed 571 dbindex 1480583 this article attempts to highlight the main differences between esperanto and ido two constructed languages that have a related past but have since parted ways ido was invented in the early 20th century after a schism between those who believed that esperanto had inherent flaws that prevented it from being a suitable international auxiliary language and those who believed that esperanto was sufficient as it was and that endless tinkering with a language would only weaken it in the end for information on the languages themselves see the links above the languages remain close and to some extent mutually intelligible an italian play which was written with the dialog in two dialects of italian was translated with esperanto and ido representing these two dialects in the same manner in which dialects often serve as sources for new words through the literature of ethnic languages so ido has contributed many neologisms to esperanto especially in poetic substitutes for long words using the mal prefix linguistic comparison esperanto is based on the fundamento de esperanto by l l zamenhof whereas the grammar of ido is explained in the kompleta gramatiko detaloza di la linguo internaciona ido morphology morphology is where one of the largest differences between the two languages can be seen both languages have the same grammatical rules concerning nouns ending with o adjectives ending with a and many other aspects however the relationship between nouns verbs and adjectives underwent a number of changes with ido based on the principle of reversibility in both languages one can see a direct relationship between the words multa many and multo a multitude by simply replacing the adjectival a with a nominal o or the other way around some minor differences include the loss of adjectival agreement and the change of the plural from an agglutinative j tacked onto the end to a synthetic replacement of the terminal o with an i hence esperanto belaj hundoj beautiful dogs becomes ido bela hundi ido also does away with the direct object ending n in sentences where the subject precedes the object so esperanto mi amas la belajn hundojn i love the beautiful dogs would in ido become me amas la bela hundi however esperantists claim that the esperanto adjective noun agreement makes possible greater freedom of word order and somewhat greater redundancy english and esperanto actually have about the same amount of redundancy here english because of its third person verb conjugation and esperanto because of noun adjective agreement ido which has neither does not have that redundancy greater differences arise however with the derivations of many words for example in esperanto the noun krono means a crown and by replacing the nominal o with a verbal i one derives the verb kroni to crown however if one were to begin with the verb kroni to crown and replace the verbal i with a nominal o to create a noun the resulting meaning would not be a coronation but rather the original crown this is because the root kron is inherently a noun with the nominal ending o the word simply means the thing itself whereas with the verbal i it means an action performed with the thing to get the name for the performance of the action it is necessary to use the suffix ado which retains the verbal idea thus it is necessary to know which part of speech each esperanto root belongs to ido introduced a number of suffixes in an attempt to clarify the morphology of a given word so that the part of speech of the root would not need to be memorized in the case of the word krono a crown the suffix izar to cover with is added to create the verb kronizar to crown from this verb it is possible to remove the verbal ar and replace it with a nominal o creating the word kronizo a coronation by not allowing a noun to be used directly as a verb as in esperanto ido verbal roots can be recognized without the need to memorize them however this solution is only partial and with other derivations it is still necessary to know the parts of speech of ido roots the main difference is that ido corresponds more overtly to the expectations of the romance languages whereas esperanto is more heavily influenced by slavic semantics this aspect of esperanto had been simply assumed by its inventor and had not been made explicit when ido was created vocabulary although both esperanto and ido share a large amount of the same vocabulary there are many important differences ido uses the twenty six letter latin alphabet in its entirety without any special characters or diacritics conversely esperanto eliminates the unnecessary letters q w x and y and adds and aside from these minor spelling differences ido aims to correct what were perceived as deficiencies in esperanto however ido lacks the one to one correspondence between letters and phonemes that esperanto has using the three digraphs qu sh and ch one to one correspondence has been used by almost all planned languages to ease the learning esperanto speakers however are allowed to use cx gx hx jx sx and ux as digraphs by the fundamento although they prefer not to when they can avoid it dr zamenhof used ch gh hh jh sh and u it was the advent of computers that substituted the letter x since it does not exist in esperanto internationality the creators of ido felt that much of esperanto was either not internationally recognizable or unnecessarily deformed ido aims to fix these with more international or corrected roots this can sometimes be at the expense of esperanto s simplified word building process below are some examples in first esperanto then ido with english french german italian and spanish for linguistic comparison note that four of the languages chosen in this chart are romance languages and that english has also had large influences from french and latin in comparison esperanto is somewhat more influenced by german vocabulary and slavic semantics and has more priority over word compounding by affixes affixes ido claims the prefix mal creating a word with the exact opposite meaning in esperanto to be overused as a prefix and also that it can be inappropriate since it has negative meanings in many languages and proposes des as an alternative in some cases ido also uses a series of opposite words in lieu of a prefix for example instead of malbona bad the opposite of bona good ido uses mala or instead of mallonga short the opposite of longa long kurta listening comprehension was also given as a reason the primary ido grammar book states that one reason for the adoption of the latin based sinistra for left instead of maldextra mal plus the word dextra or dekstra for right is that often only the last one or two syllables can be heard when shouting commands ido does not assume male gender in a word for example frato means brother in esperanto but sibling in ido ido uses the suffixes ino female used as in esperanto and ulo male not to be confused with the same esperanto suffix which means person thus sister would be fratino the same as esperanto but brother fratulo some groups use three separate words patro father matro mother and genitoro parent compare this with esperanto patro patrino and gepatroj respectively the last is especially difficult in esperanto since the prefix ge means both genders together and is inherently plural thus rendering parents instead of parent one might say unu el la gepatroj one out of the parents there is however a non official suffix in esperanto that means male i o see gender correlatives ido does not use the regularized table of correlatives as esperanto but uses latin derived roots so esperanto kio equals ido quo what esperanto tie equals ido ibe there etc proper nouns esperanto may or may not esperantize names and proper nouns depending on many factors most standard european names have equivalents as do many major cities and all nations ido on the other hand treats most proper nouns as foreign words and does not render them into ido personal names as stated above most european given names have esperanto equivalents john is johano alexander is aleksandro etc because some cultures place the surname first before the given name and others last after it it is the practice of some esperanto writers to give surnames in all capital letters although it is unusual to find this in publications john smith would thus be rendered john smith or johano smith in the first mention most non western names do not have equivalents and are rendered as close as possible in esperanto orthography ido on the other hand simply leaves the names as is john smith would be john smith in ido names from languages with non latin scripts are rendered as phonetically as possible ido does not capitalize surnames place names most countries have their own names in esperanto the system of derivation though is sometimes complex in old world nations where the country is named after an ethnic group the main root means a person of that group anglo is an englishman franco is a frenchman originally names of nations were created by the addition of the suffix ujo container hence england and france would be rendered anglujo and francujo respectively literally a container full of englishmen frenchmen more recently esperanto has adopted io as the national suffix thus creating names more inline with standard international practice and less odd looking anglio francio in the new world where citizens are named for their nation the name of the nation is the main word and its inhabitants are derived from that kanado canada kanadano canadian names of cities may or may not have an esperanto equivalent londono for london nov jorko for new york place names which lack wide spread recognition or which would be mangled beyond recognition usually remain in their native form cannes is usually rendered as cannes in ido country names must conform to the language s orthography but otherwise are left unchanged europa peru amerika city names are treated as foreign words london except when part of the name itself is a regular noun or adjective nov york nov for nova or new but the place name york is not changed as in esperanto nov jorko this is not a hard and fast rule however and new york is also acceptable similar to writing köln for the city of cologne in germany south carolina becomes sud karolina much in the same way that a river called the schwarz river is not transcribed as the black river in english even though schwarz is the german word for black however less well known place names are generally left alone so a small town by the name of battle river for example would be written the same way and not transcribed as batalio rivero this is because transcribing a little known place name would make it nearly impossible to find in the original language number of speakers the most reliable estimate for the number of esperanto speakers is around 1 6 million though estimates vary widely in the same manner estimates for the number of ido speakers are far from accurate but 500 to a few thousand is most likely it is also important to note the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of study will enable one to understand the other with little difficulty and there are a number of people that have learned ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger esperanto movement and vice versa the number of participants at the respective international conferences is also much different esperanto conferences average 2000 to 3000 participants every year whereas ido conferences have had anywhere from 13 to 25 participants over the last decade each language also has a number of regional conferences during the year on a much less formal basis and with smaller numbers history this section attempts to chronicle the history of the esperanto and ido movements in relationship to one another for individual histories of the languages please see history of esperanto and history of ido the history of esperanto and its relationship to ido is one filled with perceived rivalry and betrayal as well as a good amount of misunderstanding many esperantists have felt betrayed by the ido movement and many idists feel their language doesn t get the respect it deserves in 1900 louis couturat after initial correspondences with esperanto founder l l zamenhof created the delegation for the adoption of an international auxiliary language in 1907 in vienna the delegation met to chose an international auxiliary language to give its approval from among the many candidates which had crept up most esperantists assumed esperanto would be an easy win however when couturat presented his own pet project a series of reforms to esperanto which would eventually become ido and demanded an answer within a month many in the esperanto movement felt betrayed some esperantists even accuse couturat and his colleague marquis louis de beaufront of a conspiracy saying the international delegation was simply a front to put forth ido idists tend to see things differently they note that many of the changes ido made to esperanto were those originally proposed by zamenhof s reformed esperanto which were ultimately rejected by the majority of the language s speakers idists perceived that esperanto was flawed in many ways and that rather than a conspiracy against the language the proposals put forward by courutat were simply improvements which were sorely needed language samples for comparison here is the lord s prayer in both languages see also ido

 id=219794 title rudder nonfiltered 582 processed 575 dbindex 1480587 a rudder is a device used to steer ships boats submarines aircraft hovercraft or other conveyances that move through air or water rudders operate by re directing the flow of air or water past the hull or fuselage thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft in basic form a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft s stern tail or after end often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag on simple watercraft a tiller essentially a stick or pole acting as a lever arm may be attached to the top of the rudder to allow it to be steered by a helmsman in larger vessels cables pushrods and hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels in typical aircraft pedals operate rudders via mechanical linkages history of the rudder early history oars mounted on the side of ships for steering are documented from the 3rd millennium bce in ancient egypt in artwork wooden models and even remnants of actual boats an early example of an oar mounted on the stern is found in the egyptian tomb of menna 1422 1411 bc stern mounted oars were also quite common in roman times as proved from contemporary depictions china the world s oldest known depiction of a stern mounted rudder can be seen on a pottery model of a chinese junk dating from the 1st century ce predating their appearance in the west by a thousand years the chinese stern mounted rudder is hung from the stern held in place and controlled with a rope mechanism also many junks incorporated fenestrated rudders rudders with holes in them allowing for better control an innovation adopted in the west in 1901 to increase the manoeuvrability of torpedo boats detailed descriptions of chinese junks during the middle ages are known from various travellers to china such as ibn battuta and marco polo europe oars mounted on the side of ships evolved into quarter rudders which were used in antiquity until the end of the middle ages in europe as the size of ships and the height of the freeboards increased quarter rudders became unwieldy and were replaced in europe by the more sturdy stern mounted rudders with pintle and gudgeon attachment from the 12th century the west s oldest known depiction of a stern mounted rudder can be found on church carvings dating to around 1180 all evidence indicates that the european stern mounted rudder whose technical specifications considerably differ from the chinese one was invented independently the only actual concept which can be claimed to have been transmitted from the chinese is the idea of a stern mounted rudder and not its method of attachment nor the manner in which it was controlled since that idea of putting a rudder on the stern can be traced back to the models found in egyptian tombs the need to have the concept brought into the middle east is questionable at best there is no evidence to support the contention that the sternpost mounted rudder came from china and no need to call on exterior sources for its introduction into the mediterranean arabs the arabs also used a sternpost mounted rudder which differed technically from both its european and chinese counterparts on their ships the rudder is controlled by two lines each attached to a crosspiece mounted on the rudder head perpendicular to the plane of the rudder blade the earliest evidence comes from the ahsan al taqasim fi marifat al aqalim the best divisions for the classification of regions written by al muqaddasi in 985 the captain from the crow s nest carefully observes the sea when a rock is espied he shouts starboard or port two youths posted there repeat the cry the helmsman with two ropes in his hand when he hears the calls tugs one or the other to the right or left if great care is not taken the ship strikes the rocks and is wrecked technical details boat rudders may be either outboard or inboard outboard rudders are hung on the stern or transom inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post which comes up through the hull to deck level often into a cockpit some sailors use rudder post and mast placement to define the difference between a ketch and a yawl similar two masted vessels yawls are defined as having the mizzen mast abaft ie aft of the rudder post ketches are defined as having the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post small boat rudders that can be steered more or less perpendicular to the hull s longitudinal axis make effective brakes when pushed hard over however terms such as hard over hard to starboard etc signify a maximum rate turn for larger vessels aircraft rudders on an aircraft the rudder is called a control surface along with the rudder like elevator attached to horizontal tail structure and ailerons attached to the wings that control pitch and roll the rudder is usually attached to the fin or vertical stabilizer which allows the pilot to control yaw in the horizontal axis ie change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing the rudder s direction is manipulated with the movement of foot pedals by the pilot in practice both aileron and rudder control input are used together to turn an aircraft the ailerons imparting roll the rudder imparting yaw and also compensating for a phenomenon called adverse yaw adverse yaw is readily seen if the ailerons alone are used for a turn the downward moving aileron acts like a flap generating more lift for one wing and therefore more drag initially this drag yaws the aircraft in the direction opposite to the desired course a rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed wing aircraft but much more slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction use of rudder and ailerons together produces co ordinated turns in which the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is in line with the arc of the turn neither slipping under ruddered nor skidding over ruddered improperly ruddered turns at low speed can precipitate a spin which can be dangerous at low altitudes sometimes pilots may intentionally operate the rudder and ailerons in opposite directions in a maneuver called a forward slip this may be done to overcome crosswinds and keep the fuselage in line with the runway or to more rapidly lose altitude by

 id=68946 title born oppenheimer approximation nonfiltered 599 processed 591 dbindex 1480604 short description the born oppenheimer approximation bo is ubiquitous in quantum chemical calculations of molecular wavefunctions it consists of two steps in the first step the nuclear kinetic energy is neglected that is the corresponding operator is subtracted from the total molecular hamiltonian in the remaining electronic hamiltonian the nuclear positions enter as parameters the electron nucleus interactions are not removed and the electrons still feel the coulomb potential of the nuclei clamped at certain positions in space this first step of the bo approximation is therefore often referred to as the clamped nuclei approximation the electronic schrödinger equation is solved out of necessity approximately with a fixed nuclear geometry as input the quantity stands for all electronic coordinates obviously the electronic energy eigenvalue depends on the chosen positions of the nuclei varying these positions in small steps and repeatedly solving the electronic schrödinger equation one obtains as a function of this is the potential energy surface pes because this procedure of recomputing the electronic wave functions as a function of an infinitesimally changing nuclear geometry is reminiscent of the conditions for the adiabatic theorem this manner of obtaining a pes is often referred to as the adiabatic approximation and the pes itself is called an adiabatic surface in the second step of the bo approximation the nuclear kinetic energy containing partial derivatives with respect to the components of is reintroduced and the schrödinger equation for the nuclear motion is solved this second step of the bo approximation is far from trivial and involves separation of vibrational and rotational motion the real number is the total energy of the molecule including contributions from electrons nuclear vibrations and rotations footnotes derivation of the born oppenheimer approximation it will be discussed how the bo approximation may be derived and under which conditions it is applicable at the same time we will show how the bo approximation may be improved by including vibronic coupling to that end the second step of the bo approximation is generalized to a set of coupled eigenvalue equations depending on nuclear coordinates only off diagonal elements in these equations are shown to be nuclear kinetic energy terms it will be shown that the bo approximation can be trusted whenever the pess obtained from the solution of the electronic schrödinger equation are well separated for all we start from the exact non relativistic time independent molecular hamiltonian with the position vectors of the electrons and the position vectors of the nuclei are with respect to a cartesian inertial frame distances between particles are written as distance between electron i and nucleus a and similar definitions hold for and we assume that the molecule is in a homogeneous no external force and isotropic no external torque space the only interactions are the coulomb interactions between the electrons and nuclei the hamiltonian is expressed in atomic units so that we do not see planck s constant the dielectric constant of the vacuum electronic charge or electronic mass in this formula the only constants explicitly entering the formula are za and ma the atomic number and charge of nucleus a it is useful to introduce the total nuclear momentum and to rewrite the nuclear kinetic energy operator as follows suppose we have k electronic eigenfunctions of that is we have solved the electronic wave functions will be taken to be real which is possible when there are no magnetic or spin interactions the parametric dependence of the functions on the nuclear coordinates is indicated by the symbol after the semicolon this indicates that although is a real valued function of its functional form depends on for example in the molecular orbital linear combination of atomic orbital lcao mo approximation is an mo given as a linear expansion of atomic orbitals aos an ao depends visibly on the coordinates of an electron but the nuclear coordinates are not explicit in the mo however upon change of geometry i e change of the lcao coefficients obtain different values and we see corresponding changes in the functional form of the mo we will assume that the parametric dependence is continuous and differentiable so that it is meaningful to consider which in general will not be zero the total wave function is expanded in terms of with and where the subscript indicates that the integration implied by the bra ket notation is over electronic coordinates only by definition the matrix with general element is diagonal after multiplication by and integration over the electronic coordinates the total schrödinger equation is turned into a set of k coupled eigenvalue equations depending on nuclear coordinates only the column vector has elements the matrix is diagonal and the nuclear hamilton matrix is non diagonal with the following off diagonal vibronic coupling terms the vibronic coupling in this approach is through nuclear kinetic energy terms solution of these coupled equations gives an approximation for energy and wavefunction that goes beyond the born oppenheimer approximation unfortunately the off diagonal kinetic energy terms are usually difficult to handle this is why often a diabatic transformation is applied which retains part of the nuclear kinetic energy terms on the diagonal removes the kinetic energy terms from the off diagonal and creates coupling terms between the adiabatic pess on the off diagonal if we can neglect the off diagonal elements the equations will uncouple and simplify drastically in order to show when this neglect is justified we suppres the coordinates in the notation and write by applying the leibniz rule for differentation the matrix elements of as the diagonal matrix elements of the operator vanish because this operator is hermitian and purely imaginary the off diagonal matrix elements satisfy the matrix element in the numerator is the matrix element of the one electron operator appearing on the right hand side is finite when the two surfaces come close the nuclear momentum coupling term becomes large and is no longer negligible this is the case where the bo approximation breaks down and a coupled set of nuclear motion equations must be considered instead of the one equation appearing in the second step of the bo approximation conversely if all surfaces are well separated all off diagonal terms can be neglected and hence the whole matrix of is effectively zero the third term on the right hand side of the expression for the matrix element of tn the born oppenheimer diagonal correction can approximately be written as the matrix of squared and accordingly is then negligible also only the first diagonal kinetic energy term in this equation survives in the case of well separated surfaces and a diagonal uncoupled set of nuclear motion equations results which are the normal second step of the bo equations discussed above we reiterate that when two or more potential energy surface approach each other or even cross the born oppenheimer approximation breaks down and one must fall back on the coupled equations usually one invokes then the diabatic approximation historical note the born oppenheimer approximation is named after m born and r oppenheimer who wrote a paper der physik vol 84 pp 457 484 1927 entitled zur quantentheorie der molekeln on the quantum theory of molecules this paper describes the separation of electronic motion nuclear vibrations and molecular rotation somebody who expects to find in this paper the bo approximation as it is explained above and in most modern textboooks will be in for a surprise the reason being that the presentation of the bo approximation is well hidden in taylor expansions in terms of internal and external nuclear coordinates of i electronic wave functions ii potential energy surfaces and iii nuclear kinetic energy terms internal coordinates are the relative positions of the nuclei in the molecular equilibrium and their displacements vibrations from equilibrium external coordinates are the position of the center of mass and the orientation of the molecule the taylor expansions complicate the theory and make the derivations very hard to follow moreover knowing that the proper separation of vibrations and rotations was not achieved in this paper but only 8 years later c eckart physical review vol 46 pp 383 387 1935 see eckart conditions one is not very much motivated to spend much effort into understanding the work by and born and oppenheimer how famous it may be although the article still collects many citations each year it is safe to say that it is not read anymore except perhaps by historians of science external links the bo paper translated from german

to exploit a tiny spaceship he had found magneto sent the brotherhood to apprehend the diminutive mister one who controlled the large mister two the villains attacked one and two and captain america in a park during the battle salomon wrapped himself around captain america stating slither is my name and strangling is my game when s h i e l d arrived the brotherhood fled back to headquarters and magneto captured mister one the brotherhood was shocked to learn the plot involved the tiny spaceship when captain america and mister two attacked salomon constricted around two until two threw salomon against lifter as he prepared to crush captain america two threw salomon around lifter incapacitating him when mister one exploded the tiny spaceship the villains were forced to flee the five mutants abandoned by magneto were hired by the mandrill and given the team name of the mutant force a name they kept in the following years they attacked a coloradan air force base with an army of

large numbers of los angeles workers have moved to the county in recent years to take advantage of relatively affordable housing costs alongside neighboring san bernardino county it is one of the fastest growing parts of greater los angeles this spawned a wave of toll road construction in the area in the 1990s starting with the addition of toll commuter lanes to the 91 freeway the main traffic

 id=46933 title spelljammer nonfiltered 605 processed 597 dbindex 1480610 spelljammer 1989 is a campaign setting for the advanced dungeons dragons 2nd edition role playing game which features a fantastical as opposed to scientific outer space environment spelljammer introduced into the ad d universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics including the ptolemaic concept of crystal spheres crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with spelljamming helms ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space with their own fields of gravity and atmosphere the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction but instead look more like galleons animals birds fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes the spelljammer setting is designed to allow the usual sword and sorcery adventures of dungeons dragons to take place within the framework of outer space tropes flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects like the planescape setting spelljammer unifies most of the other ad d settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting say dragonlance to travel to another say the forgotten realms however unlike planescape it keeps all of the action on the prime material plane and uses the crystal spheres and the phlogiston between them to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings though the cosmology is derived largely from the ptolemaic system of astronomy many of the ideas owe much to the works of jules verne and his contemporaries and to related games and fiction with a steampunk flavor a strong age of sail flavor is also present the fantasy astrophysics of spelljammer spelljamming helms spelljamming helms are the central setting concept which allow interplanetary and interstellar space travel for vessels which would otherwise not be spaceworthy within the dungeons dragons universe they are a method of converting magical energy into motive power gravity and air all bodies of a sufficiently large size have gravity this gravity usually but not always exerts a force equal to the standard gravitational attraction on the surface of an earth sized planetary body gravity in the spelljammer universe is also an exceptionally convenient force and almost always works such that down orients itself in a manner most humanoids would find sensible all bodies of any size carry with them an envelope of air whenever they leave the surface of a planet or other stellar object unlike real world astrophysics this air envelope is not dispersed by the vacuum of space these bubbles of air provide breathable atmosphere for varying lengths of time but 3 months is considered standard crystal spheres a crystal sphere also known as a crystal shell is a gigantic spherical shell which contains an entire planetary system each sphere varies in size but typically they are twice the diameter of the orbit of the planet that is furthest from the sun or planet at the centre of the sphere the system s primary the surface of the sphere is called the sphere wall and separates the void of wildspace within the sphere from the phlogiston that surrounds and flows outside the sphere the sphere wall has no gravity and appears to be impossible to damage by any normal or magical means portals allow spelljamming ships or wildspace creatures to pass through the sphere wall and enter or exit from a crystal sphere portals can spontaneously open and close anywhere on the sphere wall magical spells or magical items that reproduce their effects can allow a portal to be located other magic can open a new portal or collapse an existing one ships or creatures passing through a portal when it closes may be cut in two note that unlike the ptolemaic system the crystal spheres are not nested within each other the phlogiston the phlogiston also known as the flow is a bright extremely combustible gas like medium that exists between the crystal spheres every crystal sphere floats in the phlogiston very slowly bobbing up and down over time travel between crystal spheres is facilitated by the formation of flow rivers sections of the phlogiston which have a current and greatly reduce travel time travel through the slow flow i e off the flow rivers is possible but very dangerous the spelljammer the spelljammer is a legendary ship which looks like a gigantic manta ray and houses an entire city on its back all spacefarers people who live in wildspace have heard of the spelljammer but very few have ever seen it themselves it is this ship that gives its name to spelljamming spelljamming helms and anything else connected with spelljamming the ship has been reported to have been seen in countless spheres for as long as records go back even some groundlings people who live on planets that have very little or no commerce with spelljamming communities have legends about it there are hundreds of conflicting legends about this ship and a mythology has developed about the ship that is similar to the legends surrounding the flying dutchman as a living thing although it consumes no matter it does absorb heat and light through its dorsal side and uses them to produce air and food for its inhabitants the spelljammer has a complex life cycle and means of procreation normally the ship has no captain and wanders the cosmos seemingly aimlessly when the spelljammer has a captain obtained through another complex process it will create smalljammers miniature versions of the spelljammer that go forth as its spawn apparently there can only be one spelljammer at any one time one smalljammer will mature into a full spelljammer ship if it is ever destroyed for more details on the spelljammer ship please consult the legend of the spelljammer boxed set which was released by tsr in 1991 races alien races inhabiting

born on 12 april 1922 in the chinsali district of the northern province of northern rhodesia although chinsali was remote from the country s urban centres it was an area of political importance it was also an area of strong religious competition between the protestant united free church of scotland based at lubwa from 1905 and the roman catholic white fathers mission based at ilondola from 1934 one of lubwa s early missionaries was david kaunda the father of kenneth kaunda who became the first president of zambia in 1964 simon kapwepwe became zambia s second vice president both kapwepwe and kenneth kaunda had their primary education at lubwa mission they were together again at lubwa mission when they were undergoing training to become teachers independence struggle kapwepwe moved to kitwe on the copperbelt where he got a job teaching in a primary school due to his dissatisfaction with the policies of the colonial northern rhodesian government he became a founding member of the northern rhodesian african congress in 1948 this party was soon renamed the africa national congress anc under the leadership of harry nkumbula kapwepwe was a member of the national executive and became secretary of the kitwe branch however in 1949 kapwepwe returned to chinsali with kaunda where they planned to start a farm both of them remained politically active through the chinsali african welfare association which doubled as a branch of the anc kapwepwe secured a scholarship to india in 1950 so he terminated his teaching career in order to pursue further studies for four years one of the subjects he studied was journalism in his absence the white settlers achieved their long cherished dream of creating the central african federation or the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland in october 1953 the black african majority s opposition to this new entity was organized by the anc but it was not very successful on kapwepwe s return to northern rhodesia in january 1955 he found the anc leaderless since both harry nkumbula and kenneth kaunda had been imprisoned for two months for distributing subversive literature in their absence kapwepwe assumed the mantle of leadership and introduced policies of racial equality and passive resistance to colonial power tactics which he had learned that indians under the leadership of mahatma gandhi had used most effectively against british colonialism when nkumbula returned from prison he appointed kapwepwe to the position of anc provincial president for northern province kapwepwe later held the position of anc s treasurer nkumbula s allegedly autocratic leadership and his willingness to compromise on the fundamental issue of majority rule resulted in a rift within the anc kapwepwe together with kaunda and other more militant members broke away and formed the zambia african national congress zanc in october 1958 this party was banned by the colonial authorities in march 1959 its leaders were detained and kapwepwe was sent to mongu in barotseland while the zanc leadership was in jail mainza chona and other nationalists broke away from anc and formed a new party the united national independence party unip kapwepwe and the other imprisoned leaders of zanc joined the new party when he was release from jail in december 1959 he helped organize provincial and district branches of unip in barotseland in 1960 kapwepwe and kaunda attended the federal review conference in london together with mainza chona and harry nkumbula this conference dug the grave of the central african federation and laid the foundations for the independence of zambia and malawi as preparation for this eventuality an election was held in northern rhodesia in october 1962 kapwepwe challenged dauti yamba and won convincingly the result of the election was a unip anc coalition government in which kapwepwe was given the post of minister of african agriculture after independence the general election held in january 1964 was won by unip with 55 seats as opposed to the anc s 10 seats kapwepwe was given the post of minister of home affairs in september 1964 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs and held that post for three years during that time he lambasted the british government for failing to stop or control rhodesia s unilateral declaration of independence under the rebellious ian smith in 1965 despite their friendship from childhood kapwepwe and kaunda drifted apart after leading zambia to independence for example in 1967 kapwepwe led a rebellion within unip he stood against reuben kamanga and the won position of deputy leader within unip as a consequence kaunda promoted him to the position of republican vice president he used his new position to put forward economic policies that differed from kaunda s but his views were sidelined he also campaigned for the preservation of zambian culture through the teaching of indigenous languages in schools in august 1969 he offered to resign from the vice presidency and the deputy leadership of unip this move was precipitated by tribal friction within unip kaunda did not want to lose him and managed to dissuade him from taking that move however in october 1970 kaunda replaced kapwepwe with mainza chona in the post of vice president kapwepwe was allowed to keep the posts of minister of culture and minister of local government the end of political life kapwepwe s life in unip began drawing to an end when he was linked with rumours of a new party called the united progressive party upp that had been formed on the copperbelt he did not own up until kaunda dismissed four cabinet ministers on suspicion of being clandestine members of the new party in august 1971 kapwepwe resigned from unip and the government then he announced that he was indeed the leader of upp in december 1971 he won a by election for the mufulira west constituency and became his party s sole representative in parliament kaunda was not pleased with this development so on 4 february 1972 he banned upp and imprisoned 122 members of the party including kapwepwe kaunda s excuse was that upp was an instrument of the white rhodesian south african and portuguese governments kapwepwe was kept in prison until 31 december 1972 by then kaunda had neutralized any threat that kapwepwe could pose the chona commission under the chairmanship of mainza chona was appointed in february 1972 to make recommendations for the constitution of a one party participatory democracy i e a one party state after collecting four months of public hearings the commission s report was submitted to kaunda in october 1972 the second republic i e the one party state was inaugurated on 1 january 1973 the day after kapwepwe was released from detention kapwepwe was harassed even after he had been politically emasculated he was arrested in february 1973 for illegal possession of two guns he received a two years suspended sentence the unip controlled zambian media reported that kapwepwe had sent people for military training outside zambia he sued the zambia broadcasting services the times of zambia and the zambia daily mail for libel and won when he proved that they had made false reports kapwepwe turned his back on politics and went to live on his farm in chinsali in the spirit of national unity kaunda asked kapwepwe to return to unip in september 1977 to test his erstwhile friend s sincerity kapwepwe stood for the 1978 one party presidential nomination against kaunda he was disqualified by last minute changes to unip s constitution he retired for good from politics and returned to chinsali he died on 26 january 1980 after suffering from a stroke two days earlier external links http www geocities com maiddie kapwepwe html http people africadatabase org

mass extinctions that have occurred on earth in the past it takes this subject and shows a very interesting possibility for how it might happen today if the basics of the story are to be believed in doing this it touches at the love we show for others in different forms from boyfriend girlfriend to the love within our families due to this more or less constant push on relationships this anime

practically out of takeru s dreams they are promptly attacked by a strange alien looking monster which is defeated when takeru mysteriously and spontaneously transforms into a powerful and strange

boys and their families she knows only her love for takeru most of the group live in a type of group home along with jennifer portman a drunken american super scientist who can t keep her hands off the boys and has her own theories about what hikari is the series follows them as they hang out go to school and take trips and all the while hikari and also later her sister akari learn about the human condition they are also joined by a shape shifting robot called ioneos apparently loyal to hikari and kuon a little floating alien they also encounter more strange monsters on occasion the series spirals towards a rather unexpected climax questioning the value of human life relationships love and the spirit of survival shown by all life on earth main characters takeru takemoto takeru is

japanese luci christian english supporting characters jennifer portman jennifer portman is a crazy american super scientist who came to japan for reasons yet unknown most likely due to events in the first episode and is currently boarding with takeru hikari and mari so far she has yet to be seen without some kind of alcohol shinichi and daijirou shinichi asakura and daijirou matsumura are two rather strange boys they seem to always be dreaming up some kind of perverted fantasy especially once they met hikari they even made the rather comical allusion to a sailor hikari type scenario sumie and itchou itchou and sumie nishino are takeru s aunt and uncle and the parents of mari they took in takeru when his mother abandoned him at a young age currently they run two business ventures one of which is a delivery business for various items and the other is renting out their place as a boarding service for extended periods of time kuon kuon is the name of the little creature that takes care of akari he looks like a specter with 2 luminous eyes but no defined body shape except by his clothing he is capable of levitation and apparently has some sharp tentacles as he is seen carrying a

demolished after the blast following ioneos release he resides with takeru ryo hikari and mari in takeru s boarding house his powers appear to be that of shape shifting and melding with objects as seen when he appears on the car roof preventing hkari from fallng from the speeding vehicle and also acting as a barrier between a natural hot spring that he accidentally uncovered during the group s mountain excursion ioneos enjoys drinking and he sometimes becomes irrational after too many drinks jennifer nicknamed him neos saying that his original name was too long trivia in the second episode

alexis carrel was also a member of learned societies in the u s spain russia sweden the netherlands belgium france vatican city germany italy and greece and received honorary doctorates from queen s university of belfast princeton university california new york brown university and columbia university he collaborated with american physician charles claude guthrie in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs and carrel was awarded the 1912 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for these efforts due to his membership of the collaborationist ppf and of his role in implementing eugenics policies during vichy france he was accused after the war of collaborationism but died before the trial stinky contributions to science on january 17 1912 carrel placed a part of chicken s embryo heart in fresh nutrient medium in a stoppered pyrex flask of his design every 48 hours the tissue doubled in size and was transferred to a new flask the tissue was still growing 20 years later longer than a chicken s normal lifespan during the first world war 1914 1918 carrel and the english chemist henry drysdale dakin developed the carrel dakin method of treating wounds with sutures which prior to the development of widespread antibiotics was a major medical progress for this carrel was awarded the légion d honneur he co authored a book with famed pilot charles a lindbergh the culture of organs and worked with lindbergh in the mid 1930s to create the perfusion pump which allowed living organs to exist outside of the body during surgery the advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of open heart surgery and organ transplants and to have laid the groundwork for the artificial heart which became a reality decades later some critics of lindbergh claimed that carrel overstated lindbergh s role to gain media attention but other sources say lindbergh played an important role in developing the device both lindbergh and carrel appeared on the cover of time magazine on june 13 1938 in 1972 the swedish post office honored carrel with a stamp that was part of its nobel stamp series in 1979 the lunar crater carrel was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs now he is dead relation to eugenics and fascism in 1935 carrel published a best selling book titled l homme cet inconnu man this unknown which advocated in part that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group intellectuals and by implementing a regime of enforced eugenics sociologist roger caillois quoted and paraphrased l homme cet inconnu in the edge of surrealism p resent day proletarians owe their status to inherited intellectual and physical defects sancta simplicitas and heggggsdfasd suggests that this state of affairs should be accenetuated through appropriate measures so as to correlate social and biological inequalities more precisely society would then be directed by a hereditary aristocracy composed of descendants from the crusaders the heroes of the revolution the great criminals the financial and industrial magnates p 360 carrel advocated the use of gas chambers to rid humanity of inferior stock thus endorsing the scientific racism discourse his endorsement of this idea began in the mid 1930s prior to the nazi implementation of such practices in germany in the 1936 german introduction of his book at the publishers request he added the following praise of the nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages t he german government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective the mentally diseased and the criminal the ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous carrel also wrote t he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip or some more scientific procedure followed by a short stay in hospital would probably suffice to insure order those who have murdered robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun kidnapped children despoiled the poor of their savings misled the public in important matters should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses a similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane guilty of criminal acts while these statements do not neccessarily endorse forced euthanasia against individuals innocent of what carrel considered dangerous anti social behaviour and the statement in the german edition of his book was written three years before the nazi regime enacted the infamous t 4 euthanasia program his views and affiliations remain highly controversial in 1937 carrel joined jean coutrot s centre d etudes des problèmes humains coutrot s aim was to develop what he called an economic humanism through collective thinking in 1941 through connections to the pétain cabinet specifically french industrial physicians andré gros and jacques ménétrier he went on to advocate for the creation of the fondation française pour l etude des problèmes humains french foundation for the study of human problems

hygiène national hygiene institute which later became the inserm some scholars such as lucien bonnafé patrick tort and max lafont have accused carrel of responsibility for the execution of thousands of mentally ill or impaired patients under vichy they argue that this policy was inspired by carrel s advocacy of eugenics carrel s association with vichy and the harshness of his advocacy for eugenics has led to his descent from fame to obscurity in recent years jean marie le pen leader of the far right front national party national front has become an advocate for carrel referring to him as the first environmentalist or if you will the first modern ecologist precisely because he committed himself to defining the relationships of natural harmony his writings on eugenics are studied avidly in the training camps of the national front in the 1990s the attention the national front s support brought to carrel s fascist associations and controversial views created a series of

equipment can be extremely expensive it is sometimes referred to as cost no object equipment owners of high end audio are either audiophiles or conspicuous consumers audiophiles run the gamut from budget to high end in terms of equipment price range and are primarily concerned with the quality of music reproduction accuracy with personal preferences definition of high end high end audio can refer to the build quality of the components but more specifically refers to the ability to reproduce a recording with the highest fidelity to the original performance that has been committed to the recording typical qualitative attributes that are scaled by audiophile publications and experts are accuracy vs warmth tonal color vs speed timbre size of sound stage vs depth spatial origins clarity pace timing etc etc a theoretically perfect high end audio system would create the illusion of the musical performers actually being present and performing right in front of the listener there would be no sonic signature that imparts any clue as to the fact that the performance is a playback of a recording instead of a live performance by actual musicians in the listening room this is obviously more important with performances involving acoustic instruments and without studio manipulations of vocals professional recording studios professional recording studios seldom use high end audio gear for mixing and monitoring recording sessions instead studios use players amplifiers signal processors and speakers that are built to very high standards these speakers are referred to as studio monitors and are specially crafted to produce very accurate sound reflecting exactly what is on the recording most high end speakers will tend to add color or tone shaping the music so that it sounds

 id=3777622 title grid friendly nonfiltered 667 processed 659 dbindex 1480672 note the term grid friendly is trademarked and refers to energy usage management technology and the use of energy efficient products and services which operate in a manner that supports electrical power grid reliability the owner and the trademark are hereby recognized the concept of a grid friendly device is fairly simple but understanding its purpose and method of action requires an understanding of electric power transmission systems there are three principle stimuli currently recognized for grid friendly response frequency voltage and price grid friendly devices exhibit one or more of these three responses grid friendly devices can include major appliances found in homes commercial building systems such as hvac and many industrial systems frequency response most electric systems use alternating current with a nominal frequency of 50 or 60 hz hertz to deliver energy produced by electrical generators to the electricity consumers when the amount of electric power produced by the generators exceeds the power used by the customers the frequency of the electricity rises conversely when the amount of electric power produced is less than what is consumed the frequency drops therefore frequency is an accurate indicator of the system wide called global balance between supply and demand without grid friendly frequency response the rate at which the frequency changes is dependent principally on the system s total inertia which is not very controllable and the aggregate response of the generators control systems which can only be controlled relatively slowly in contrast grid friendly devices can act very quickly a grid friendly device can respond to changes in frequency by reducing or interrupting the demand for electric power called load when the frequency drops below a certain threshold and or increasing load when the frequency rises although a single grid friendly device may be a very small load the fraction of the total load that can be controlled by frequency at any time is usually sufficient to provide under frequency protection to the system before more drastic measures like black outs are required the advantage of grid friendly frequency response is that frequency is ubiquitous on an electric system when a generator shuts down in one part of the system all the loads everywhere in the system can simultaneously detect the change and respond instantly and appropriately without the need for a control system to detect the problem a control center to make a decision or a telecommunications network to deliver commands to millions of devices this type of behavior changes frequency from a simple electrodynamic and control systems input to an emergent property while there is still some controversy on the subject it is believed that complex systems utilizing self regulation through emergence are generally more resilient and flexible than are simpler top down command and control systems voltage response in contrast to frequency voltage varies widely throughout electric systems because it is the voltage difference between two devices that largely determines the direction and magnitude of the current hence the power that flows between them therefore voltage is a more local phenomenon and grid friendly devices that respond to voltage will support more local aspects of the electric delivery system price response while frequency and voltage respond to physical phenomena on the electric system grid friendly price response is designed to address economic phenomena with the increasing application of electricity markets to manage the efficient distribution of electric power more consumers are exposed to electricity prices that change over time rather than fixed for months or years in general higher prices occur at times when the electric system is running short of supply the purpose of grid friendly price response is to promote demand response among electricity consumers demand response is one means of reducing the market power of electricity suppliers when production runs short grid friendly response to price also allows consumers to reduce their energy costs by using less electricity when prices are high and more electricity when prices are low sources and additional resources us department of energy office of

was a professor of law who retired early and devoted his time to private historical and literary studies and to political activity as a founder member of the national liberal party which he represented in the prussian parliament and was a founder member of the german colonial society his mother marie grimm née schlumberger edle von goldeck was a minor aristocrat as a child hans grimm showed an interest and aptitude for writing and in 1894 started to study literature and french at the university of lausanne under pressure from his father he left university in 1895 and went into business working for a german company in great britain in nottingham and london and then in the british ruled cape colony in port elizabeth and east london where he also rented a small farm works although grimm s south african sojourn lasted only fourteen years from 1897 to 1911 it had a profound effect on him with few minor exceptions all his literary work several collections of short stories and novels is set in southern africa his most famous novel is volk ohne raum 1926 the programmatic title a people without space indicates grimm s belief that germany s problems exacerbated by defeat in the first world war were caused by its lack of space at home or in overseas colonies individuals and therefore the nation were unable to develop to their fullest potential the novel established him as one of germany s leading writers and demonstrated clearly his political sympathies with the political right in weimar germany and the title became a popular slogan of the national socialist movement the commercial success of this work sales of the single volume edition amounted to 500 000 by 1943 clearly shows the extent to which it struck a chord with german readers in the 1920s and 1930s from a strictly literary point of view and leaving their ideological bias to one side the most readable of grimm s works are however his novellen and short stories in which the discipline imposed by restricted space forces him to abandon the discursive wordiness of volk ohne raum 1344 pages in the one volume edition nazism grimm was a supporter of the nazis believing that only they could restore german national dignity and economic and political stability but his relationship with the party of which he never formally became a member became increasingly strained as he fell out of sympathy with the illegality of its methods in a centenary address der verkannte hans grimm lippoldsberg 1975 designed to restore grimm s reputation klaus von delft was able to cite letters of complaint from grimm to the nazi authorities on a number of subjects the infringement of the right of confidentiality at the ballot box the behaviour of the hitler jugend and the nazi student association the coupling of foreign and domestic policy issues in the 1936 referendum on hitler s rule and criticism of hitler s presentation of the murders of the night of the long knives in 1934 as due judicial process it is however indicative of grimm s stance that von delft is not able to find or cite any criticism of national socialist racial policy in 1938 grimm was threatened with imprisonment by progandaminister joseph goebbels and withdrew from public life despite everything however even after 1945 grimm remained true to his political convictions in a pamphlet die erzbischofsschrift antwort eines deutschen 1950 a response to a message from the archbishop of canterbury to the german people grimm described germany s war of aggression as an attempt to defend european culture against communism and blames great britain for escalating a local conflict into a global war in 1954 having failed to gain a seat in the west german parliament for the extreme right wing deutsche reichspartei he published a detailed defence of national socialism under the title warum woher aber wohin why whence but whither later irrelevance in the context of post war germany grimm was however a literary and political irrelevance and died in 1959 in lippoldsberg in the restored monastic buildings which he had purchased after the first world war and where from 1934 to 1939

 id=643343 title password tv series nonfiltered 688 processed 680 dbindex 1480693 password was a long running american television game show produced by mark goodson bill todman productions the show was initially hosted by allen ludden and was created by bob stewart for goodson todman productions password originally aired for 1 555 telecasts from october 2 1961 to september 15 1967 on cbs and for 1099 additional shows from april 5 1971 to june 27 1975 on abc daytime the show s regular announcers were jack clark and later lee vines on cbs and john harlan on abc how to play two teams each consisting of one celebrity player and one civilian contestant competed the password the word to be conveyed was given to one player on each team and was shown to the audience and to home viewers game play alternated between the two teams on either team the player who was given the password gave a one word clue from which his her partner attempted to guess the password if the partner failed to guess the password in the allotted five second time limit or if an illegal clue was given two or more words a hyphenated word or any part or form of the password play passed to the opposing team the game continued until one of the teams guessed the password correctly or until ten clues had been given scoring was based on the number of clues given when the password was guessed i e 10 points were awarded for guessing the password on the first clue nine points on the second clue eight points on the third clue etc down to one point on the tenth and final clue on the abc revival the rules imposed a limit of six clues with the last clue worth five points in order to expedite the gameplay in addition teams were given the option of either playing or passing control of the first clue to the opposing team specifically the team that was trailing in score or who had lost the previous game was offered the option when the score was tied the team that failed to get the password was awarded the option the first team to reach 25 points won the game and a chance to win an additional 250 by playing the lightning round in which the civilian contestant on the prevailing team tried to guess five passwords within 60 seconds from clues given by his her celebrity partner 50 was awarded for each correctly guessed password increased to 100 from 1973 to 1974 the lightning round was among the first bonus rounds on a television game along with the phrase game on the original beat the clock on the abc version from 1971 1974 immediately after completing the lightning round the player wagered any amount of his her winnings on his her celebrity partner s ability to guess a betting word within 15 seconds on each episode from 1961 1975 ludden would caution the players about unacceptable clues by stating if you hear this sound a buzzer would sound it means your clue has not been accepted by our authority name of word authority word authorities on the cbs version included new york university professor david h greene and world book dictionary editor dr reason a goodwin robert stockwell and carolyn duncan served as word authorities during the abc version contestants on the cbs daytime version contestants played two matches win or lose with each game awarding 100 to the winner during the first few weeks of the cbs nighttime version the same two players stayed for the entire show playing as many matches as time allowed this practice was eventually changed to at least three pairs of contestants each playing one match with each losing contestant earning 50 each nighttime game awarded its winner 250 in 1965 the show adopted an annual tournament of champions where contestants on the daytime version who won both their games were invited back to compete for more money on the abc version winning contestants could stay until either defeated or victory in a maximum of 10 games thus retiring them as undefeated champions abc removed this limit later in the show s run from 1973 1974 the first contestant to win a two out of three match played the lightning round from november 18 1974 to february 21 1975 password became password all stars where teams of celebrities played for charity in a tournament style format the tournament ended with the grandmaster s championship which involved richard dawson bill bixby hal linden and betty white dawson won the tournament and was awarded 25 000 for his favorite charity after the celebrity format modification proved unpopular with fans goodson todman made password all stars simply password again but the show carried over elements of all stars mainly in order to use the set that had been redesigned for the all celebrity period among these were an elimination round in which four contestants three new players and the winner from the previous game competed with the help of the two celebrities in the first round in the qualifying round one of the two celebrities used a one word clue to a password with both celebrities alternating turns on giving clues and the four contestants would ring in with the password a correct response earned that contestant one point with three points needed to qualify for the regular game an incorrect response locks that player out of the word in play the first two contestants to reach three points went on to play the regular password game in the regular game an addition to the rules was the double option which the first clue giver could ask to increase the word value to 20 points by giving only one clue if that word was missed the other team could score the 20 points with a second clue the first team to reach 50 points or more could win thousands of dollars in the big money lightning round using a three step structure in which the winning team attempted to guess three passwords within 30 seconds per structure the contestant was paid as follows part one each password paid 25 guessing all three passwords in 30 seconds further netted 5 for each second left on the clock obviously the round ended if the received proved unable to guess any of the three passwords and the contestant returned to the elimination panel to compete for the right to play the main game again part two the money earned in part one would be multiplied by the number of passwords guessed in part two naming all three passwords this time added 10 for each second left if the receiver failed to identify any of the passwords in part two the round ended and the contestant still kept all part one winnings part three naming all three passwords in 30 seconds multiplied the contestant s part two winnings tenfold meaning if a player accumulated 500 after two parts guessing all three passwords in this part would earn him her 5000 in cash password won the first ever daytime emmy award for outstanding game show in 1974 the abc password was the first of the goodson shows to be taped regularly on the west coast the original cbs version made annual trips to cbs television city during the 1960s including once when the cbs new york studios were fitted for color tv otherwise it was most often taped in new york at cbs tv studio 52 now studio 54 and cbs tv studio 50 the ed sullivan theater password moved permanently to hollywood california at abc studio tv 10 the vine street theater on vine street in hollywood and the abc television center on prospect avenue when abc brought it back in 1971 scheduling history cbs 1961 67 upon its premiere in 1961 password had not only the prestige and reputation of goodson todman and former ge college bowl host ludden but also enjoyed fairly weak competition from abc and nbc at its timeslot 2 p m eastern 1 central where it stayed for the entirety of its cbs run for the first few years the show was so successful that the other two networks ran mostly short lived talk variety shows and soap operas against it further the program that followed it was another daytime television institution art linkletter 27s house party these two shows along with cbs dominating soap line up made the network nearly an impregnable choice for daytime viewers however cbs news preemption of the show one day in july 1966 in order to cover a pentagon press conference infuriated some viewers many of whom changed channels to discover two relatively new shows a meldromatic emotionally charged soap on nbc titled days of our lives and a titillating sometimes suggestive game on abc from chuck barris titled the newlywed game both new shows especially attracted large numbers of young housewives the favorite demographic group for daytime advertisers such as cleaning products toys and the like this left password with an increasingly older audience and the predisposition of then cbs daytime head fred silverman against the genre did not help things despite pleas by mark goodson to have the show s timeslot changed to 4 p m where it would have faced his own match game on nbc and the eventual cult soap favorite dark shadows on abc silverman decided to pull the plug at the end of the 1966 67 season succeeding password at 2 1 was an in house network soap love is a many splendored thing which ran until 1973 password did not entirely leave the public consciousness however as some color episodes after circa 1965 went into syndicated reruns a practice better known among cancelled situation comedies numerous local stations ran these until about 1970 or so typically to fill a gap in their morning or late afternoon schedules their success prompted goodson todman to revive what s my line in first run five day per week syndication which in turn brought about several revivals of older formats during the 1970s abc 1971 75 the economic recession that greeted the turn of the new decade left the networks daytime divisions saddled with a large number of costly serials which had reached an all time high number in 1970 with such saturation abc looked to unload one or more of their soaps and they chose none other than dark shadows to begin the housecleaning in spite of its devoted fan base the problem was that the fans were overwhelmingly teenagers who were not considered suitable targets for advertising at that time of day abc programmers took note of password s surprising success in syndication and approached goodson about reviving the show goodson locked out of cbs due to continued unresponsiveness and crowded out of nbc due to strong games there jumped at the offer and set up shop for the first time in southern california the april 1971 premiere of password at 4 p m eastern 3 central marked the first g t game on the networks since nbc cancelled match game some eighteen months earlier despite actual threats by some enraged dark shadows follwers to disrupt production of password the show went forward and instantly beat the nbc soap somerset and reruns of gomer pyle usmc on cbs impressed by the ratings numbers abc believed the show would help bolster a sagging midday lineup thus in september password moved to 12 30 11 30 swapping places with edited half hour reruns of love american style there it held its own against cbs venerable soap search for tomorrow and nbc s the who what or where game but in march 1972 the network bought a fast paced quiz from stefan hatos and monty hall titled split second and shoved password up a half hour where it remained until its cancellation unfortunately this may not have been a good move as nbc s jeopardy had long dominated the 12 noon 11 timeslot further when cbs replaced its controversial soap where the heart is with a new entry the young and the restless in march 1973 things got even worse as the soap became an unexpectedly immediate hit even though nbc moved jeopardy in favor of ironically enough the bob stewart packaged jackpot in january 1974 password did not benefit and abc and g t decided to perform radical surgery on the show with the all stars format this proved to be the show s undoing on abc due to viewers aversion to games with no civilian contestants participating and the multi layered game structure which many believed bogged down the show s formerly brisk pace by spring 1975 g t abandoned this mistake and made a last ditch attempt to salvage the show with a blending of both all stars and the original game structure but the effort was futile as viewers kept defecting and abc cancelled password along with all but two of its daytime games by independence day ludden wife betty white goodson and the production staff gave a gracious farewell on the finale another goodson todman game showoffs took its place on the schedule revivals main article password plus and super password password plus nbc brought password back as password plus on january 8 1979 with allen ludden returning as host it was originally announced in variety magazine as password 79 in the manner that match game named its 1973 version with the year but the name was changed when during a run through carol burnett commented this is more than password it s password plus super password on september 24 1984 nbc brought the format back as super password with bert convy hosting and gene wood announcing rich jeffries was the announcer for the first ten weeks and filled in for wood sporadically thereafter bob hilton also filled in for one week in 1985 or 1986 super password ran until march 24 1989 and was cancelled on the same day as another nbc game show sale of the century celebrities among the more famous password celebrity players over the years include lucille ball elizabeth montgomery joan crawford bill bixby richard dawson carol burnett vicki

betsy palmer sammy davis jr jerry lewis and on one memorable nighttime episode mr mrs james stewart delighted viewers with their gameplay many stars of the new york theater scene also made appearances

crew played a prank on sajak during the super version instead of the usual word display sound effect during one main game the viewers heard the four note signal that is used to introduced wheel of fortune main game puzzles password fixtures white cullen lawrence markie post a former goodson todman staffer shelly smith and russell were also frequent panelists on pyramid peter lawford also did both shows although he was considered much better at password lawford set a long standing record for playing the lightning round in the shortest time 12 seconds on the cbs version it would take nearly a decade and a switch to abc before elizabeth montgomery finally broke the record with a 10 second lightning round episode status many but not all of the cbs primetime episodes were preserved on videotape the final year of the cbs daytime version was preserved on color videotape as the producers chose to syndicate those reruns following the program s first cancellation most of the earlier daytime episodes are presumed lost at least two daytime episodes are available on home video each one as part of a general game show compliation package the abc version is considered to be almost completely gone clips from an abc episode featuring brett somers and jack klugman was featured on vh1 s i love the 70s volume 2 in 2006 gsn aired the complete somers klugman episode on the morning of september 11 2006 in the early morning hours as part of its weekly overnight classic game show programming a second studio master from 1972 and featuring sheila macrae and martin milner is also known to have survived three more episodes survive on the videotape trading circuit as recorded by home viewers the password all stars finale a 1975 episode with betty white and vicki lawrence and the 1975 finale with kate jackson and sam melville a few more episodes from the abc version also exist at ucla s film and television archive it is believed that the videotapes that were used for the abc version of password were recycled and reused for the dawson version of family feud a few years later both nbc revivals of password exist in their entirety theme songs the theme song used on password from 1961 to 1963 is called holiday jaunt by kurt rehfeld that was followed the same year by a catchy swing theme composed by bob cobert from 1963 to 1967 which was used until the cbs version s cancellation viewers would often see emcee ludden snapping his fingers to the cobert swing tune as the closing credits flashed when password returned on abc in 1971 score productions provided a theme with a synth heavy arrangement similar to the cues heard on the price is right the theme used later in that version s run beginning with password all stars in 1974 was titled bicentennial funk and was used until the finale in 1975 a vamp version of bicentennial funk was once considered for use as a think cue on the game show match game but it never made it that theme as well as the themes for password plus and super password were also composed by score productions versions outside the usa in new zealand a m ori language version called kupuhuna is aired 3 nights a week on m ori television in the united kingdom versions of password were produced by the bbc in the 1970s and by thames television for channel 4 which was hosted by tom o connor and ulster television for itv in the 1980s which was hosted by gordon burns home versions the milton bradley company introduced the first home version of password in 1962 and subsequently released 24 editions of the game until 1986 owing to common superstition these releases were numbered 1 12 and 14 25 skipping 13 it was tied with concentration as the most prolific of milton bradley s home versions of popular game shows and was produced well into the super password era of the television show milton bradley also published three editions of a password plus home game between 1979 and 1981 more recently endless games has released four versions of password since 1997 a computer version of super password was released by gametek for ms dos systems as well as the apple ii and commodore 64 shortly before the show was canceled a nintendo entertainment system version was also planned but never released tiger electronics also released an electronic handheld super password game in the late 90 s oddly many years after the show had been cancelled trivia the practice of the announcer whispering the password to the home audience as well as displaying it on screen was devised by creator bob stewart for the benefit of his mother who could speak but not read english during the last few weeks before its cancellation in 1969 the set of the goodson todman game snap judgement on nbc changed to resemble the look of the cbs password because neither original announcer jack clark nor goodson todman chief announcer johnny olson had yet moved to california from new york as they would do shortly after the 1971 password premiere another voiceover artist john harlan best known at that point for his work on you don t say won the job for the abc version harlan is probably better known to the general public for the nbc bob hope specials and the several incarnations of name that tune between 1974 and 1985 until the introduction of all stars the abc version used the same mechanical clock for the main portion of the lightning round as on cbs but switched to a digital eggcrate display for the betting word when all stars began all numerical displays were converted to digital in super password convy affectionately called the prop used in the ca hword rounds the magic toaster the original magic toaster was accidentally destroyed by convy on one infamous episode causing the producers to create a new one which betty white

reformed and german reformed denominations and strengthened the small baptist and methodist denominations it had little impact on anglicans and quakers unlike the second great awakening that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched the first great awakening focused on people who were already church members it changed their rituals their piety and their self awareness the revival began with jonathan edwards a well educated congregationalist minister from northampton massachusetts who sought to build off puritan calvinist roots but emphasizing the importance and power of immediate personal religious experience edwards was a powerful speaker and attracted a large following sinners in the hands of an angry god while atypical for edwards is his most famous sermon the methodist preacher george whitefield visiting from england continued the movement traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style accepting everyone into his audiences the new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into religion in america people became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called new lights while the preachers of old were called old lights people began to study the bible at home which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in europe during the protestant

siegfried engelmann and elaine c bruner isbn 0 02 686355 3 the book is part of the thirty one volume reading mastery series published by the sra macmillan early childhood education division of mcgraw hill it uses the direct instruction teaching style the story gained notoriety because u s president george w bush was reading it with sarasota florida schoolchildren in emma e booker elementary school at the time at which then white house chief of staff andrew card informed him of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks plot the pet goat is the story of a girl s pet goat which eats everything in its path the girl s parents want to get rid of the goat but she defends it in the end the goat becomes a hero when it butts a car robber into submission a sample passage a girl got a pet goat she liked to go running with her pet goat she played with her goat in her house she played with her goat in her yard but the goat did some things that made the girl s dad mad the goat ate things he ate cans and he ate canes he ate pans and he ate panes he even ate capes and caps bush s 2001 reading of the book bush s critics notably michael moore in his film fahrenheit 9 11 have argued that the fact that bush continued to read the book after being notified of the attacks shows that he was indecisive his supporters on the other hand contend that he was able to project calm in a crisis and not disturb the schoolchildren by interrupting his visit actor charlie sheen who believes that the bush administration orchestrated the attacks has said it seems to me that upon the revelation of that news that the secret service would grab the president as if he was on fire and remove him from that room at 9 07 a m andrew card whispers in bush s ear that america is under attack and immediately leaves without waiting for any kind of response from the president critics have asked if this is all the information bush needed to fully comprehend the situation after spending about 20 minutes with the children bush was scheduled to give a short press conference at about 9 30 at the press conference inside the same school bush makes his first speech about the attacks and is never evacuated by the secret service many bush supporters point out that according to the washington times correspondent bill sammon bush s press secretary ari fleischer was in the back of the classroom holding a pad on which he had written don t say anything yet on the evening of 9 11 bush stated immediately following the first attack i implemented our government s emergency response plans our military is powerful and it s prepared our emergency teams are working in new york city and washington d c to help with local rescue efforts in orlando florida on december 4 2001 bush explained actually i was in a classroom talking about a reading program that works and i was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in and i saw an airplane hit the tower the tv was obviously on and i used to fly myself and i said there s one terrible pilot and i said it must have been a horrible accident but i was whisked off there i didn t have much time to think about it again at a town meeting in ontario in january 2002 first of all when we walked into the classroom i had seen this plane fly into the first building there was a tv set on and you know i thought it was pilot error and i was amazed that anybody could make such a terrible mistake and something was wrong with the plane both statements however have been criticized as impossible the first plane to hit the tower was not televised shortly after

agreed with the sept 11 overall commander mohamed atta may god rest his soul to carry out all operations in 20 minutes before bush and his administration could take notice it never occurred to us that the commander in chief of the american forces would leave 50 000 citizens in the two towers to face those horrors alone at a time when they most needed him because he thought listening to a child discussing her goat and its ramming was more important than the planes and their ramming of the skyscrapers this gave us three times the time needed to carry out the operations thanks be to god popular culture the incident was parodied on madtv where inside bush s mind he is thinking that the pet goat is attacking america when andrew card resigned from the white house staff jon stewart mocked the fact that he had informed the president of the 9 11 attacks he claimed satirically that the daily show had audio as well as video wherein card rushes over to the president and says we re under attack but keep reading i must know what happens to the goat in the 2006 parody film scary movie 4 the president played by leslie nielsen is notified by one of his secretaries that aliens have

 id=3263036 title succession conflict nonfiltered 744 processed 736 dbindex 1480749 in the conflict of laws the subject of succession deals with all procedural matters relevant to estates containing a foreign element whether that element consists of the identity of the deceased those who may inherit or the location of property the relevant choice of law rules often distinguish both between the administration of the estate and the succession to it and between the succession to movable and immovable property albeit that many states are considering amendment so that a single law will apply to all administration and succession issues such uniformity is considered more desirable than the present arrangement that often requires different laws for movables and immovables definitions in civil law systems there are two types of property out of comity the conflict of laws has adopted the civil law terminology as the standard immovables is the equivalent of real property in common law systems i e it is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface all other property is considered movables i e the equivalent of personal property or personalty in common law systems and this property is either tangible or intangible i e it is either physical property that can be touched like a computer or it is an enforceable right like a patent some other form of intellectual property or a chose in action such as shares bank accounts etc connecting factors domicile in common law states every person acquires a domicile of origin which if the individual is legitimate will be that of their father during their minority children have a domicile of dependency which will change to follow the controlling parent after reaching the age of majority young adults can establish a new domicile of choice in another state but this requires long term residence accompanied by an intention to remain in the new state indefinitely so it is quite difficult to change the domicile of origin hence the lex domicilii is favoured as the connecting factor for all aspects of status and capacity for all those who may become involved in resolving disputes over the distribution of the deceased property nationality civil law states use either the concept of nationality or habitual residence as the connecting factor i e the principles are the same as for domicile but the way in which they are applied is less rigourous so it a nationality can be changed by naturalisation and a new habitual residence established with fewer delays and technical difficulties as above the lex patriae determines status and capacity the lex successionis as with a choice of law clause or forum selection clause in contract a testator may nominate a law or laws by which both to interpret and test the validity of the will and to govern administration and succession but there must be a real connection between the choice s and the location of assets or beneficiaries and the choices must invoke provisions of law that are consistent with any mandatory provisions either in the lex fori or the lex situs if a choice of law is made in respect of part of an estate it is assumed that the deceased wishes that law to apply to the whole of the estate unless there is clear evidence to the contrary or mandatory principles of law are relevant to cover the residual assets and their inheritance the lex situs the general rule is that the lex situs applies to determine all issues relating to title to immovable property and some issues relating to movables the lex fori the courts in which lawsuits are initiated will tend to prefer the application of the lex fori because the fact of the litigation suggests that some aspect of the administration is to be effected within the jurisdiction there may also be some claims arising from public policy if the forum court considers the application of the lex causae is going to produce a significantly unjust result administration in most states the lex fori regulates the administration by personal representatives appointed to act within the jurisdiction of forum irrespective of the deceased s lex domicilii but the rights of beneficiaries is a matter for the lex successionis testamentary capacity states differ in their view on the sophistication of today s youth and whether they are old enough to own property and to dispose of that property by a will the debate seems to moving to a general stance that it is not rational to distinguish between the ages at which full capacity is achieved hence if one is old enough to get married one should equally be old enough to provide for spouse and children because there are fewer discriminations against individuals who have physical disabilities many states also permit mouthwriting footwriting and similar kinds of writing that enable the disabled to communicate there is less agreement on whether videotape digital and electronic wills should be admissible to probate although testators may not have the physical ability to write e g because they are hospitalised and close to death there is concern that digital and electronic forms are too easily manipulated and altered hence unless there is adequate evidence to exclude forgery the courts are reluctant to admit such wills to probate succession in some states there is complete freedom for testators to leave their assets to whomever or whatever purpose they wish to promote but the majority of states allow a surviving spouses children and dependents of a locally based deceased to claim against the estate if the will fails to make adequate provision for them some proactively limit the testator s capacity by imposing minimum provisions for surviving dependents although these rules are relatively clear in their operation during the subsistence of the marriage determining the effect of either a divorce or nullity decree is more problematic if by its existence or the terms of any order made it purports to adjust the property entitlements of the other spouse for example suppose that a husband obtains a nullity decree in a state declaring the marriage to have been void ab initio if that decree is recognised across state boundaries the effect would be to remove any claim that the supposed wife would otherwise have had as to the testator all questions of status and capacity should be determined by the personal law at the time the decree is granted thus if the decree is recognised either the status will be modified so that the testator was never married and this will retrospectively validate or invalidate previous dispositions or the testator is now single and able to dispose of his assets in any way permitted by his personal law but as to the putative wife any entitlement she will have will be determined by whether the lex situs of any matrimonial assets recognises the decree if the decree is not recognised she will remain a wife for the purposes of succession protected by the local system of mandatory heirship or community property laws immovables the general rule is that the lex situs governs the succession to immovables regardless of the deceased s personal law i e lex domicilii lex patriae or habitual residence so for example land in france belonging to an english domiciliary will pass according to the french law on forced heirship but complications may arise because some states apply renvoi to succession cases hence english law would apply the lex situs to immovables located outside the jurisdiction but if that foreign law say as in spain applies the deceased s lex patriae and rejects any renvoi english law would be applied if under spanish law the deceased had an english nationality movables the general view is that the deceased s personal law will determine succession to movables no matter where they are located unless a lex situs provides otherwise thus for example succession to the estate of a french testator leaving movables situated in england would be governed by french law and the french rules of forced heirship would apply given that english law does not limit the application of the lex domicilii on this point the formal validity of wills a will will usually be considered valid if it was properly executed according to the law of the place where it was executed or the testator was domiciled either when the will was executed or at the time of death the policy of most laws is to uphold the validity of wills to respect the demonstrated intention of the testator so if validity is established under either law it will be deemed valid or the testator was a national either at the time of execution or death or the testator was habitually resident either at the time of execution or death the essential validity of wills even though a will may be formally valid it may not be essentially valid e g as above the succession to movables will be governed by the deceased s personal law and if there is a limitation on testamentary capacity the terms of a will breaching that law will be invalid even if it was validly executed similarly a will validly executed in one state cannot override mandatory provisions in the lex situs this is an application of the principle of evasion because otherwise a husband who wished to evade laws imposing community property could defeat the claims of a wife by the simple expedient of executing a formally valid will in a state that did not contain such a law intestacy where there is no will the appointment and duties of personal representatives will be determined by the deceased s personal law succession to an intestate s estate will also be governed by his or her personal law and the lex situs of the assets harmonisation the hague convention of 1 august 1989 on the law applicable to succession to the estates of deceased persons applies to a the form of dispositions of property upon death b capacity to dispose of property upon death c issues relating to matrimonial property d property rights interests or assets created or transferred otherwise than by succession such as in joint ownership with right of survival pension plans insurance contracts or arrangements of a similar nature it nominates as the lex causae for succession the law of habitual resident if that was also the deceased s nationality if the deceased had been resident in a state for at least five years and no other state has a better claim the law of residence applies in all other cases the personal law with the best claim applies see also the european commission s green paper consulting on succession with an

 id=3239291 title fracture toughness nonfiltered 745 processed 737 dbindex 1480750 in materials science fracture toughness is a property which describes the ability of a material containing a crack to resist fracture and is one of the most important properties of any material for virtually all design applications it is denoted kic and has the units of fracture toughness is a quantitative way of expressing a material s resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present if a material has a large value of fracture toughness it will probably undergo ductile fracture brittle fracture is very characteristic of materials with a low fracture toughness value table of values here are some typical values of fracture toughness for various materials sources internal and external flaws act as stress risers raising the effective stress normal to the crack plane more important for the purpose of predicting instability we can estimate the elastic stress field in the neighbourhood of a crack tip and thereby determine the elastic strain energy that would be released if the crack were to grow in order for the crack to propagate spontaneously this energy must exceed the surface energy of the two new crack surfaces when there is plastic deformation at the crack tip as occurs most often in metals the energy to propagate the crack may increase by several orders of magnitude this total energy release rate is given the symbol gic where the roman number i ii or iii indicates the way the crack opens e g whether there is a twisting component or not and c denotes criticality the crack will only propagate when gic exceeds some critical value in short when elastic energy released surface energy created for ductile metals gic is around 50 to 200 kj m2 for brittle metals it is usually 1 5 and for glasses and brittle polymers it is almost always less than 0 5 more significant adjustments to this kind of calculation take account of the shape of the flaw and its relationship to the shape and size of the structure this has led to the concept of a stress intensity factor analogously to gic at criticality this is given the symbol kic typical values are 150 mn m3 2 for ductile very tough metals 25 for brittle ones and 1 10 for glasses and brittle polymers notice the different units used by gic and kic engineers tend to use the latter as an indication of toughness where there is extensive plastic deformation this treatment has to be modified because the plastic zone at the tip of the crack consumes the major part of the work of fracture and modifies the elastic strain field in the crack tip region elastic energy released surface energy plastic deformation energy conjoint action there are number of instances where this picture of a critical crack is modified by corrosion thus fretting corrosion occurs when a corrosive medium is present at the interface between two rubbing surfaces fretting in the absence of corrosion results from the disruption of very small areas that bond and break as the surfaces undergo friction often under vibrating conditions the bonding contact areas deform under the localised pressure and the two surfaces gradually wear away fracture mechanics dictates that each minute localised fracture has to satisfy the general rule that the elastic energy released as the bond fractures has to exceed the work done in plastically deforming it and in creating the very tiny fracture surfaces this process is enhanced when corrosion is present not least because the corrosion products act as an abrasive between the rubbing surfaces fatigue is another instance where cyclical stressing this time of a bulk lump of metal causes small flaws to develop ultimately one such flaw exceeds the critical condition and fracture propagates across the whole structure the fatigue life of a component is the time it takes for criticality to be reached for a given regime of cyclical stress corrosion fatigue is what happens when a cyclically stressed structure is subjected to a corrosive environment at the same time this not only serves to initiate surface cracks but see below actually modifies the crack growth process as a result the fatigue life is shortened often considerably stress corrosion cracking scc this phenomenon is the unexpected sudden failure of normally ductile metals subjected to a constant tensile stress in a corrosive environment certain austenitic stainless steels and aluminium alloys crack in the presence of chlorides mild steel cracks in the present of alkali boiler cracking and copper alloys crack in ammoniacal solutions season cracking worse still high tensile structural steels crack in an unexpectedly brittle manner in a whole variety of aqueous environments especially chloride with the possible exception of the latter which is a special example of hydrogen cracking all the others display the phenomenon of subcritical crack growth i e small surface flaws propagate usually smoothly under conditions where fracture mechanics predicts that failure should not occur that is in the presence of a corrodent cracks develop and propagate well below kic in fact the subcritical value of the stress intensity designated as kiscc may be less than 1 of kic as the following table shows the subcritical nature of propagation may be attributed to the chemical energy released as the crack propagates that is elastic energy released chemical energy surface energy deformation energy the crack initiates at kiscc and thereafter propagates at a rate governed by the slowest process which most of the time is the rate at which corrosive ions can diffuse to the crack tip as the crack advances so k rises because crack length appears in the calculation of stress intensity finally it reaches kic whereupon fast fracture ensues and the component fails one of the practical difficulties with scc is its unexpected nature stainless steels for example are employed because under most conditions they are passive i e effectively inert very often one finds a single crack has propagated while the rest of the metal surface stays apparently unaffected see also toughness brittle ductile transition zone charpy impact

guantanamo bay detainment camps in cuba al karim s guantanamo detainee id number is 653 combatant status review tribunal initially the bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the geneva conventions to captives from the war on terror this policy was challenged before the judicial branch critics argued that the usa could not evade its obligation to conduct a competent tribunals to determine whether captives are or are not entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status subsequently the department of defense instituted the combatant status review tribunals the tribunals however were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the bush administration s definition of an enemy combatant al karim chose to participate in his combatant status review tribunal allegations the allegations against al karim in the summary of evidence presented to his tribunal were the detainee traveled to kabul sometime in later 2001 the detainee was identified as an iraqi national affiliated with al qaida the detainee resided at a guesthouse near kabul afghanistan frequented by people training at a terrorist training camp in afghanistan al farouq is best known as a basic training facility for jihadists training at this facility was conducted in four phases small arms firing physical conditioning map reading topography and explosive devices the detainee received military training in the iraqi army the detainee trained with the following weapons ak 47 rifle 7 62 mm pk machine gun and mortars 82mm 120mm and 160mm the detainee acknowledges that in 1999 he fought on the front lines against the northern alliance with the taliban near mir bachel kawt the detainee was imprisoned by northern alliance and subsequently transferred to united states authority testimony al karim said he deserted from the iraqi army in 1994 he had flect first to kurdistan for a year and then moved to iran where he had to work without official papers he had worked in a shoe factory but had left that area when the factory was raided by iranian immigration officials he had fled to a city that was near the afghan border when immigration officials captured him and a group of afghan refugees he felt it was safer to represent himself as another afghan rather than as an iraqi thus he was deported to afghanistan in 1999 al karim said he was arrested by arabs associated with the taliban on february 15 2000 because they believed he was an american spy he said that he was denounced by an associate named abdul rahim jenko who owed him money for a loan to buy shoes al karim was in a taliban prison from february 15 2000 until the prison was taken over by coalition forces and he was transferred to us custody al karim said that jenko too had been transferred to american custody when the taliban prison was captured and had also been tranferred to guantanamo witnesses al karin called two witnesses abdul zahir and janko both witnesses testified that they had known al karim in kabul and that he had been arrested by the taliban because they suspected he was an american spy zahir testified that he and al karim had stayed at abdul habib iraqi s guesthouse janko testified that al karim was the only person who had been kind to him when he came to kabul as a refugee and that al karim had bought him a pair of shoes when asked why the taliban tortured him into denouncing al karin he said he

2611 ft s 796 m s the colt commando also referred to as car 15 or xm177 is a general name for a wide array of shortened and modified ar 15 m16 firearms developed primarily in the late 20th century they are a family of gas operated locking bolt 5 56 x 45 mm carbines and were developed and produced by colt manufacturing mainly for u s special forces starting in the 1960s the moniker commando has been used to describe colt s ultra short carbine variants as well as pre a2 configuration or pre m4 in general the first weapon in this ultra short category began production in 1966 7 for special operations units during the vietnam war by the end of the conflict it had been used by members of various elite units and had been given a slew of official and semi official designations in addition to the informal names it received in the field the car 15 commando xm177 family has one of the most complicated array of variants and names among us service firearms popular monikers for the family such as car 15 or xm 177 have much more complicated meanings when talking about actual specific versions of the family in the mid 1960 s colt created and sold an ultra short carbine variant of the m16 for the us army it looked much like a miniaturized m16a1 rifle and featured a retracting buttstock modeled after the full rifle stock with a 10 in 254 mm barrel muzzle blast soon became a major issue and while the initial variants were equipped with the same flash hiders as a1 rifles special moderators were quickly created the current iteration the m16a2 commando is similar in design and has many interoperable components with the m4 carbine and the m16a2 rifle the commando being the shortest and most compact of the three weapons early models naming the original commando was created when colt began developing the ar 15 pattern newly acquired from armalite the need for a shorter handier weapon had been expressed by a number of forces engaged in the expanding conflict in south east asia in the mid 1960s and colt responded with an ultra short variant as part of its new car 15 family the model 607 car 15 commando model submachine gun note that calling it a submachine gun was a new trend in submachine gun smg naming as previous smgs were all chambered for pistol rather than rifle ammunition classifying very short assault rifles as smgs has been common practice in a number of firearm books though it is not universally accepted by the time the contract for rifles was signed by the army in 1966 car 15 smg or just car 15 and commando were the two main names in use for the colt model 607 in early field manuals the name submachine gun 5 56 mm car 15 can be found by 1967 and later a slew of new variants would be developed and were given various designations by the us army and the usaf in january 1967 the family got a type classification xm177 e1 submachine guns which featured improvements on the earlier models more variants would get even more names using air force nomenclature gau prefix the car 15 survival rifle which differed from the basic car 15 commando was a version colt developed for the air force but they did not accept it troops in the field ended up simply referring to it as car 15 rather than car 15 smg or colt commando while car 15 or colt automatic rifle 15 was to be used for an entire family of colt patterned ar 15 type weapons including 2 rifles 2 heavy barreled rifles or hbars a 16 in 406 mm carbine and the ultra short 10 in 254 mm gun it quickly fell by the wayside car 15 has since been used to describe later models such as a1 configured or pre m4 type carbines car 15 and colt commando are in the common lexicon for these breed of weapons though care must be taken when talking about specific variants really pre xm177 models are those best described with car 15 and even then it should be noted that they were the submachine gun members of that family car 15 has also persisted in the civilian market as a term for semi automatic carbines of the ar 15 m16 pattern the choice between car 15 or car 15 submachine gun xm177 colt commando or car 15 smg varies between sources when trying to describe the whole family of variants commando is probably the most accurate when talking about the family as a whole as this has been the a major part of colt factory nomenclature colt defense offers a m4 commando even in 2005 however when dealing in specifics specific variant models should be specified as their differences may be slight but are important in understanding development the 16 carbine the colt model 605 was built in 3 variants one without the forward assist one with and one with a four position burst function this function found its way onto a variant of the ultra short commando family as well as an hbar in addition to the 605 a small number of 605s were procured for the us navy seals and used by them in south east asia despite what was regarded to be a generally positive response development progressed on 607 patterned weapons the model 607 itself looks much like a miniaturized m16 featuring short older style triangular handguards and a buttstock that while retractable was similar in shape to that of the full size rifles these weapons featured a 10 barrel and were initially fitted with the same flash hiders as the parent rifles the excessive blast from the short barrel quickly made development of a specific moderator necessary and a 3 5 version was fitted to later models later on remaining model 607s in service would also be found fitted with 4 5 moderators from xm177 gau 5s described later early versions of this weapon were also not fitted with the forward assist feature like the m16 in service with the usaf later versions and the later factory designated 607a had this feature similar to the us army s m16a1s in addition to the 607 colt manufactured the model 608 which was a special survival rifle prototype made specifically for the us air force but never adopted only 10 were believed to have been made the xm177 and the gau 5 a with the initial success of the 607 idea colt refined the pattern and created 3 additional guns the 609 610 and 610b the most important features of these guns are the revised retracting stocks similar in style to the stocks commonly found on m4 type rifles originally cast out of aluminum and short round handguards to help with the issues of the barrel becoming extremely hot during prolonged firing these weapons also had 10 in 254 mm barrels and were originally fitted with the 3 5 in 89 mm moderators designed for the 607 a 4 5 in 114 mm moderator was eventually created for these weapons the 609 had a forward assist for the bolt but neither of the 610s did the air force maintained that it was an unnecessary addition that complicated the weapon and both these guns and the m16 rifles purchased by them lacked the feature the us army designated the 609 the xm177e1 and the 610 as the xm177 the us air force designated the 610 the gau 5 a and it is believed received a small number of 610bs for testing the b stands for burst and these featured colt s original four position safe semi full 3rb selector after fielding it improvements were suggested to which colt answered with the revised model 629 and model 630 in which the barrel was lengthen to 11 5 inches 292 mm which featured a barrel ring for launching rifle grenades as the use of such weapons in the us army declined the ring was retained for attaching the xm148 grenade launcher the us army designated the 629 the xm177e2 while the us air force purchased the colt model 630 no forward assist and it was classified gau 5a a the us air force also received a number of hand me down colt 629s from the us army at some time and it is believed that these weapons might have been designated gau 5a b b a might have been incorporated into existing stocks of gau 5a as cannibalised for parts or simply left undesignated colt eventually went on to improve the basic commando design in the early 1970s the barrel was lengthened to 14 5 inches 368 mm this barrel length allowed the usage of the m7 bayonet and with the decision by the us administration in the late 1970s to ban the sale of sound suppression equipment abroad the previous xm moderators had been classified by the batf as sound suppressors despite the general ridiculousness of calling them that these weapons were fitted with the standard birdcage flash suppressor used on a1 type rifles this was done to allow exportation of these weapons under the arms export act of 1976 which banned the export of sound suppressors colt produced a number of carbine models but the most prominent was the colt 653 the us army and us navy procured some in small numbers for sof units but did not officially adopt it the 653 appeared in 1973 too late to see use by us forces in south east asia late 1970s and 1980s one of the largest end users of colt 653s was israel who imported a large number just in time for the yom kippur war in the last decade or so these weapons have been extensively modified bringing them up to a pseudo m4 standard these weapons have had their stock tubes modified to allow for six positions instead of the original 2 or 4 and have a2 style pistol grips as well as m4 profile barrels the israeli defense forces idf are currently phasing these out in favor true m4 a1 carbines elisco tools in the philippines also acquired a license to produce the 653 locally with colt giving it the designation 653p the us air force has done a number of similar in house upgrades and modifications to their old gau 5 carbines starting with simple rebarrels of 10 and 11 5 in 254 and 292 mm guns with 14 5 in 368 mm a1 profile barrels it has been said that these weapons were designated gau 5 p but no official usaf source mentions this name it is more likely that these weapons either retained the designation of the parent weapons went undesignated or were designated guu 5 p like later conversions also weapons rebarreled with m4 profile barrels or with their entire upper receivers replaced with m4a1 style m1913 rail flat top upper receivers weapons in either of these configurations have been designated guu 5 p these a1 variants were used until the mid 1980s when the m16a2 and the new m855 fmj and m856 tracer rounds were adopted colt began to develop a number of carbines with the same new rifling twist 1 7 in 178 mm as the m16a2 designed to fire these new rounds while the us purchased a number of colt 720s essentially m16a2 carbines for testing other countries provided the initial impetus with the canadian firm of diemaco recently purchased by colt to provide a certain level of irony even license producing the colt model 725 as the c8 colt also updated the original ultra short commando and released the model 733 and model 735 these guns again feature an 11 5 in 292 mm barrel the difference between the 733 and the 735 is primarily in that the 733 is safe semi full s 1 f and the 735 is safe semi burst s 1 3 early 733s also had a1 style rear sights colt eventually released variants of both these guns with m1913 rail flat top upper receivers as the 933 and the 935 respectively the m16a2 commando is similar in design and has many interoperable components with the m4 carbine and the m16 rifle the commando being the shortest and most compact of the three weapons the m4 for all intents and purposes is identical to a1 style carbines with the exception of the a2 style rear sights and pistol grip upgraded stock upgraded handguards and extended feed ramps in the breach along with its distinct notched barrel profile for mounting the m203 a1 grenade launcher 2000s the colt commando concept was updated in the close quarters battle receiver upgrade for the m4 carbine a new upper receiver with a 10 3 inch 260 mm barrel and a knight s armament company rail interface system handguard this was type standardized as the mk 18 mod 0 and is in use by the united states navy seals and possibly others related models criticisms the colt commando shorter barrel models are often criticized for its barrel length which reduce muzzle velocity and generates excessive muzzle flash muzzle velocity drop can be seen from this table adopted from testing by bushmaster firearms inc an m16 and ar 15 rifle manufacturer the

into anesthetized pigs as live targets the damage done and apparent incapacitation capability of 5 56 mm rifle ammunition is significantly enhanced if the bullets fragment on impact both m193 55 grain bullets and ss109 62 grain bullets fragment moderately at velocities over 2 500 feet per second and extensively at velocities over 2 700 feet per second even 10 inch barrels for colt commando rifles have in excess of 2 700 feet per second muzzle velocity but rounds will drop below 2 700 ft s within about 20 meters and below 2 500 ft s within about 60 meters these studies were part of the body of research that led to the m4 carbine being produced with a 14 5 inch barrel length which only loses about 50 meters worth of fragmenting range about 125 meters compared to the standard 20 inch rifle

 id=6821347 title pandeism nonfiltered 753 processed 745 dbindex 1480758 pandeism is occasionally used as a synonym for pantheism or for omnitheism this article discusses other uses of the term pandeism is a term that has been used at various times to describe religious beliefs it is now particularly addressed to syncretist concepts incorporating or mixing elements of pantheism that god is identical to the universe and deism that the creator god who designed the universe no longer exists in a status where he can be reached and can instead be confirmed only by reason it is therefore most particularly the belief that god precedes the universe and is the universe s creator that the universe is currently the entirety of god with some adding the contention that the universe will one day coalesce back into a single being god this use has been inconsistent over time modern usage has described or contrasted the nature of god as described by broader philosophical systems but the term has also occasionally been misused to refer dismissively to this and also to simultaneous belief in all religions or some elements thereof some 19th century figures particularly religionist godfrey higgins later echoed by occult figure john ballou newbrough used the term to describe the beliefs that they attributed to a particular cult or sect the worshipers of a group of gods called pans for this use see pandeism godfrey higgins a pantheistic form of deism pandeism falls within the traditional hierarchy of philosophies addressing the nature of god this use of the term is a blend of the greek root pan meaning all and the latin deus meaning god pan is used this way in pantheism and panentheism and pandeism is a variation of the term pantheism pantheism in turn came from the term pantheist purportedly first used by irish writer john toland in his 1705 work socinianism truly stated by a pantheist this is fused to the word deism itself originally derived from the latin root deus centuries ago theism and deism had been interchangeable both referring to belief in god but deism was adopted by the deist movement which used it to refer to a god who was not known by revelation but could only be found by rational thought development ancient philosophy and mythology religious studies professor f e peters traced the idea to the philosophy of the milesians who had also pioneered knowledge of pantheism in his 1967 greek philosophical terms a historical lexicon what appeared here at the center of the pythagorean tradition in philosophy is another view of psyche that seems to owe little or nothing to the pan vitalism or pan deism see that is the legacy of the milesians many ancient mythologies suggested that the world was created from the physical substance of a dead deity or a being of similar power in sumerian mythology the young god marduk slew tiamat and created the known world from her body similarly norse mythology posited that odin and his brothers vé and vili defeated a frost giant ymir and then created the world from his later chinese mythology recounts the creation of elements of the physical world mountains rivers the sun and moon etc from the body of a creator called pan gu because these myths were developed by people unaware of the true scope of the universe they can fairly be said to describe the creation of the entire world from the body of one being however such stories generally have not gone so far as to identify the designer of the world as being one with the being whose body provided the material origin of modern pandeism the ideas that underscore modern pandeism have many authors but a few are of note in the 17th century baruch spinoza was perhaps the earliest to use deistic reason to arrive at the conception of a pantheistic god spinoza s god was deistic in the sense that it could only be proved by appeal to reason but it was also one with the universe as one critic states the labeling of spinoza s philosophy as pantheism by the church was meant more as an invective and indictment than a true analysis of his writings it was really a variant of deism a pandeism if i may theism however posits something very different theism believes that nature was not god but created by god that god is a completely independent sentient and cognitive being and that god interacts with his children on a personal level e g the bible spinoza s pantheistic focus on the universe as it already existed did not address the possible creation of the universe from the substance of god for spinoza rejected the very possibility of changes in the form of matter required as a premise for such a belief 18th century british philosopher thomas paine also approached this territory in his great philosophical treatise the age of reason although paine was concentrated on the deistic aspects of his inquiry it was dutch naturalist franz wilhelm junghuhn who first specifically detailed a religious philosophy incorporating deism and pantheism in his four volume treatise java seine gestalt pflanzendecke und sein innerer bau images of light and shadow from java s interior released anonymously between 1850 and 1854 junghuhn s book was banned for a time in austria and parts of germany as an attack on christianity in 1884 theologian sabine baring gould contended that christianity itself demanded that the seemingly irreconcilable elements of pantheism and deism must be combined this world is either the idea or it is the workmanship of god if we say that it is the idea then we are pantheists if we say that it is the work then we are deists but how it may be asked can two such opposite theories as pantheism and deism be reconciled they mutually exclude one another i may not be able to explain how they are conciliable but i boldly affirm that each is simultaneously true and that each must be true for each is an inexorably logical conclusion and each is a positive conclusion and all positive conclusions must be true if christ be the ideal and the focus of all truths in the 19th century poet alfred tennyson revealed that his religious beliefs also defied convention leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism integrating deism with the pantheism of spinoza and spinoza s predecessor giordano bruno developments from the 1960s to today understanding of pandeism was much advanced in the 1960s by charles hartshorne considered by many to be a theological einstein hartshorne identified pandeism as one of his many models of the possible nature of god acknowledging that a god capable of change as hartshorne insisted god must be is consistent with pandeism harteshorne preferred pandeism to pantheism explaining that it is not really the theos that is described however he specifically rejected pandeism early on in favor of a god whose characteristics included absolute perfection in some respects relative perfection in all others or ar writing that this theory is able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism hartshorne accepted the label of panentheism for his beliefs declaring that panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations in 2001 scott adams published god s debris a thought experiment in which adams set down his own variation of pandeism adams surmised that an omnipotent god annihilated himself in the big bang because god would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence and would have to end that existence in order to complete his knowledge adams asks about god would his omnipotence include knowing what happens after he loses his omnipotence or would his knowledge of the future end at that point he proceeds from this question to the following analysis a god who knew the answer to that question would indeed know everything and have everything for that reason he would be unmotivated to do anything or create anything there would be no purpose to act in any way whatsoever but a god who had one nagging question what happens if i cease to exist might be motivated to find the answer in order to complete his knowledge the fact that we exist is proof that god is motivated to act in some way and since only the challenge of self destruction could interest an omnipotent god it stands to reason that we are god s debris adams god exists now as a combination of the smallest units of energy of which the universe is made many levels smaller than quarks which adams called god dust and the law of probability or god s debris hence the title an unconventional twist introduced by adams proposes that god is in the process of being restored not through some process such as the big crunch but because humankind itself is becoming god adams is hardly the first author to incorporate pandeistic doctrines into fiction dan schneider in his review of stranger in a strange land a 1967 novel by robert a heinlein so identifies a character who appears to other characters as identifying humanity as god jubal is a devout and fierce individualist in a world filled with cults and bureaucracies and by novel s end it is he not jill nor mike that is still a stranger still tilting against the windmills he honestly believes in his own free will which mike jill and the fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge thou art god mike by contrast readily abandons his martian beliefs for human ones even as he claims to merely find a congress between them the idea of humankind becoming god is also fundamental to the 1950s isaac asimov short story the last question in which human and computer knowledge is merged before the heat death of the universe the computer which continued to exist in hyperspace had been asked how to stop entropy it finally figured out the answer and implemented it saying let there be light this is not a necessary element of pandeism but correlates with it well compatibility with scientific and philosophical proofs arguments for the existence of god support a pandeistic universe both the cosmological argument that there must be a first cause and the teleological argument that the existence of complex patterns in the universe show intentional design point to a pandeistic universe as readily as one with an activist god pandeism is compatible with evolutionary creationism in that it posits the creation of the universe by intelligent design pandeism differs from theistic creation theories by suggesting that the designer has ceased to have an independent existence the big bang may be seen as the event signifying the transformation of god into the universe scientific plausibility for this theory was introduced to pandeism through a paper written by italian astrophysicist paola zizzi notable for her work in the field of loop quantum gravity theory that regards the early universe as a kind of quantum computer zizzi proposed that the universe could have achieved the threshold of computational complexity sufficient for the emergence of consciousness during the period of cosmic inflation in a paper entitled emergent consciousness from the early universe to our mind which has become known as the big wow theory zizzi states that the universe reached a level of quantum computational complexity during the period of cosmic inflation to undergo orchestrated objective reduction or orch or allowing the emergence of consciousness zizzi s paper is fundamentally a theory of loop quantum gravity which derives some of its power from the holographic principle it suggests that the universe s conscious moment or occasion of experience came at the end of the inflationary period in physical cosmology and was the event that allowed the universe s quantum state vector to reduce thus selecting the conditions for our specific universe out of a superposed multitude of possibilities this too has been reflected in fiction in the star trek novel corona which featured sentient proto stars seeking to induce a new big bang the pandeistic universe is just as the universe described in naturalistic pantheism with the distinction that the belief necessarily encompasses a sentient god that existed before the formation of the universe panentheism also suggests a universe designed by a sentient deity and composed of matter derived from that deity the belief systems part on the point that panentheism asserts that god is greater than the universe and therefore continues a separate existence alongside it while pandeism asserts that everything that was god became incorporated into the universe because pandeists believe all consciousness in all life to be fragments of god s awareness such a god may not consciously interact with the material universe but might still exerts a latent influence over the development of the physical universe and the evolution of things within it because man is part of the material universe and therefore composed of remnants of god it could then be possible for god s energy to be tapped by an individual as with man s ability to release the power of the atom in an atomic bomb or nuclear reactor every human mind could conceivably access and release some portion of the power or the knowledge of god perhaps by simply realizing their connection with the universe through meditation if this is valid religious figures such as moses jesus mohammed the buddha and others may have been able to perform those miracles attributed to them by tapping into this infinite source of energy comparison to eastern philosophy the ideas described by pandeism in the west have resonance with certian eastern philosophies particularly with some expressions of hinduism warren sharpe wrote to the hindu for example god didn t create the universe but god became the universe then he forgot that he became the universe why would god do this basically for entertainment you create a universe and that in itself is very exciting but then what should you sit back and watch this universe of yours having all the fun no you should have all the fun yourself to accomplish this god transformed into the whole universe god is the universe and everything in it but the universe doesn t know that because that would ruin the suspense the universe is god s great drama and god is the stage the actors and the audience all at once the title of this epic drama is the great unknown outcome throw in potent elements like passion love hate good evil free will and who knows what will happen no one knows and that is what keeps the universe interesting but everyone will have a good time and there is never really any danger because everyone is really god and god is really just playing around history of use of the term the earliest known usage of a variation of pandeism to identify a pantheistic deism was in an 1859 german work zeitschrift für völkerpsychologie und sprachwissenschaft by philosophers and frequent collaborators moritz lazarus and heymann steinthal discussing religious philosophy they wrote man stelle es also den denkern frei ob sie theisten pan theisten atheisten deisten und warum nicht auch pandeisten translated as man leaves it to the philosophers whether they are theists pan theists atheists deists and why not also pandeists godfrey higgins used the term pandeism as early as 1833 to describe his theorized cult of pandu and the pandavas however the first use in english to describe a synthesis of pantheism and deism appears to be by william harbutt dawson in his 1904 biographical work matthew arnold and his relation to the thought of our time dawson used the term pan deism as a comparative reference point writing whatever the deity which satisfied arnold s personal experience may have been the religion which he gives us in literature and dogma and god and the bible is neither deism nor bare pan deism but a diluted positivism as an ethical system it is in theory admirable but its positive value is in the highest degree questionable pascal s judgment upon the god who emerged from the philosophical investigations of rené descartes was that he was a god who was unnecessary the term appears to have been little used between the 1960s and the 1990s in 1997 pastor bob burridge of the genevan institute for reformed studies wrote an essay titled god is not the author of sin identifying pandeism as a deistic refinement or subset of pantheism all the actions of created intelligences are not merely the actions of god he has created a universe of beings which are said to act freely and responsibly as the proximate causes of their own moral actions when individuals do evil things it is not god the creator and preserver acting if god was the proximate cause of every act it would make all events to be god in motion that is nothing less than pantheism or more exactly pandeism burridge disagrees that such is the case decrying that the creator is distinct from his creation the reality of secondary causes is what separates christian theism from pandeism burridge concludes by challenging his reader to determine why calling god the author of sin demand a pandeistic understanding of the universe effectively removing the reality of sin and moral law similarly a 1995 news article quotes this use of the term by jim garvin a vietnam vet who became a trappist monk in the holy cross abbey of berryville virginia and went on to lead the economic development of phoenix arizona garvin described his spiritual position as pandeism or pan en deism something very close to the native american concept of the all pervading great spirit usage as a restatement of another concept some uses to which the term has been put are etymologically disjunctive as they ascribe a meaning to the term that does not reflect the roots of what is an obvious portmanteau within a well defined family of similar terms conversely the term may describe a deistic pantheism in which a god that has always been pantheistic has ceased a previously active interection with the universe the term has been used in some instances as a restatement of pantheism the concept that god and the universe are one or panendeism the concept that god both is the universe and transcends the universe others have specified that it is a concept distinct from pantheism and have used it instead to describe a universe which combines elements of pantheism for example that god and the universe are one and deism for example that a creator god created a self regulating universe but subsequently ceased to actively intervene in its operations examples reverend natalia kita classifies her beliefs as transcendental pandeism a phrase to which she assigns the following meaning god not only is always was and always will be the universe but that the universe is contained within god and god transcends that which we know as the universe i also believe that all living beings contain the knowledge wisdom of god the universe within them if only they open their minds to it i view god not so much as a being but as a force of pure spirit and energy containing all the knowledge wisdom there is and sharing it with all this use of the term appears to be consonant with panentheism but with some minor variations with respect to the relationship between god and the individual this assertion is echoed by cristorly the pseudonym of dominican poet and theologian orlando alcántara who also characterizes the pantheistic god as transcendent while the pandeistic god is merely continuous with creation god is inmanent trascendent and holistic that is pantheism not pandeism pantheism is right because we are speaking about a personal individual trascendent god pandeism like spinoza s is not right due to the fact that is not a trascendent god a god beyond creation cristorly developed a theognosis of omnientheism which integrates six concepts theism deism panentheism panendeism pandeism and pantheism into a coherent corpus or canon cristorly describes his definitions as discretional meaning that each can only be understood in the context of all the rest cristorly asserts the terms theism pantheism and panentheism have their root in greek which is a biblical language and therefore it is correct in a discretionary way we assume that these terms present the idea of a personal individual god however the terms deism pandeism and panendeism have their root in latin which is not a biblical language and therefore it is not correct these terms present the idea of god like synonymous of energy or cosmic force because god is not personal here he is not individual within this grouping the meanings of the terms hinge on their categorization of the transcendence immanence and holism of god with respect to pandeism he notes we see that energy or cosmic force in pandeism is immanent and holistic but it is not transcendent the following excerpt from a discussion of a painting by spanish artist orlando cordero illustrates the same conceptual distinction between pantheism and pandeism the author used the words pandeísta and pandeísmo in the spanish version which were translated by the author into pandeist and pandeism respectively the comparison suggests that pandeism is a system with a cold impersonal god while pantheism presents a warm and experiential god his vision is pandeist and it had to be pantheist in order to get a pantheist painting it is necessary to have christ as pennant footpath and lighthouse pandeism is impersonal like in the present canvas in which man nature and word integrate themselves whereas pantheism is a personal christ like experience of every day here there is signal like materiality for the making of other paintings pandeism as omnitheism a different use of the term is typified in the usage ascribed by j sidlow baxter who wrote in his 1991 master work the most critical issue if the bible is only human lore and not divine truth then we have no real answer to those who say let s pick the best out of all religions and blend it all into pan deism one world religion with one god made out of many this use of the word is synonymous with omnitheism which supposes a kernal of truth in all religions rather than all being simultaneously true in their entirety in a variation on this theme the vatican has been accused of having a pandeism conspiracy with respect to other religions the church of rome uses the term pandeism to describe her current program of bringing under her wing the non christian religions of the world in this rome will finally succeed because the prediction says all the world wondered after the beast revelation 13 3

 id=147515 title busch series nonfiltered 756 processed 748 dbindex 1480761 the nascar busch series is a stock car racing series owned and operated by nascar it is nascar s second division often compared to triple a baseball and is a proving ground for drivers who wish to step up to the organization s top level the nextel cup each busch series race is usually held in the same venue as and a day prior to the nextel cup race scheduled for that weekend encouraging fans to attend both events in december 2006 nascar officials confirmed that anheuser busch parent company for busch beer will not renew its sponsorship of nascar s no 2 series after the end of the 2007 season rumored new sponsors for the series include wal mart samsung and subway history the series emerged from nascar s old sportsman division which was formed in 1950 as nascar s short track race division it was nascar s third series the sportsman cars were not current model cars and could be modified more but not as much as modified series cars it became the late model sportsman series in 1968 and soon featured races on larger tracks such as daytona international speedway drivers used obsolete grand national now nextel cup cars on larger tracks grand national cars were required to be less than three years old short track cars with relatively small 300 cubic inch v 8 motors were used drivers used smaller current year models featuring v6 motors the cars looked like smaller versions of cup cars the modern day busch series was formed in 1982 when anheuser busch sponsored a newly reformed late model sportsman series with its budweiser brand the series switched sponsorship to busch in 1984 it was renamed in 1986 to the busch grand national series the v6 based cars left the series by the mid 1990s the cars gradually changed to cars just like cup cars grand national was dropped from the series title in 2003 following the 2007 season anhauser busch makers of the busch brand of beer has said they will not renew their contract with nascar preferring to stay onboard with their budweiser brand sponsorship of the pole award in nextel cup the series will have a new sponsor in 2008 the busch series today the cars used today in the busch series are slightly different versions of their nextel cup counterparts the main differences being a slightly shorter wheelbase 105 instead of 110 and a larger spoiler 57 wide x 5 75 high instead of 55 x 4 5 in the past busch series competitors could use makes of cars not used in the cup series as well as v 6 engines instead of cup s v 8s but the cars used in the series now are very similar on march 6 2005 the busch series held its first race outside the united states the telcel motorola 200 the race was held in mexico city mexico at the autodromo hermanos rodriguez a track that had previously held formula one and champ car races in the past and was won by martin truex jr beginning in 2007 abc and espn2 will be the exclusive carrier of all busch series races currently shown on fox fx tnt and nbc some sponsors have cricitised the new television deal noting a maximum of four races will appear on broadcast network television and most likely none in prime time in recent years as many as nine races in the busch series have aired on network television with two 2005 races ending up in prime time television busch series cars used fuel that contained lead nascar conducted a three race test of unleaded fuel in this series that began with the july 29 2006 race at gateway international raceway the fuel sunoco gt 260 unleaded will be come mandatory in all series starting with the second weekend of the 2007 series as daytona will be the last race weekend with leaded fuel once the car of tomorrow is implemented in the nextel cup series nascar will begin work on changing the cars run in the busch series nascar has been approached by manufacturers about using differently shaped and named car models as the basis for the cars in the busch series when this change is made nascar has been receptive to the idea specifications engine displacement 358cid 5 8l pushrod v8 transmission 4 speed manual must have reverse weight 3100lbs

300 buschwhackers since the early days of the busch series many cup drivers have used their days off to drive in the busch series this can be for any number of reasons most prominent or often claimed is to gain more seat time or to familiarize themselves with the track examples of this would be the first ever winner of a busch series race dale earnhardt and the winner of the most races in busch series history mark martin in recent years this practice has been termed buschwhacking by those that criticize the practice claiming that cup drivers racing in the busch series takes away opportunities from the busch series regulars drivers that are usually younger and less experienced proponents of this practice however claim that without the cup superstars and the large amount of fan interest they attract the series would cease to exist in 2007 the nextel cup series will begin racing with a car of tomorrow although it is likely that many cup drivers will still race in the busch series their role may be largely diminished the busch series will not run the cot for now and thus would ruin the advantages of running the races for the cup drivers 2006 busch series season hershey s

 id=6190497 title spiritist doctrine nonfiltered 771 processed 763 dbindex 1480776 this article discusses in detail the doctrine of spiritism as presented in the works of allan kardec especially in the spirits book and the gospel according to spiritism the teachings of jesus spiritism believes jesus was on earth as a special envoy from god he was the most elevated spirit to incarnate on earth until his time and possibly even to the present his preaching was intended to break the traditional and formulaic mindset of the human race preparing the ground for the evolution of the planet to a higher state in light of these theses spiritism explains the teachings of christ as veiled hints of what would later be revealed to the world as spiritism for instance when jesus said think not that i am come to destroy the law it must be understood that christ was not revoking but perfecting or correcting what god had already shown to mankind according to spiritism the teachings of christ are eternal because they are the very law given by god the origin of this law is not the earth whe he said my kingdom is not of this world he was hinting on the heavenly origin of his teachings and the heavenly nature of the work he was doing he did not come as a human messiah to save physical lives and restore a temporal kingdom but to spread the truth about the afterlife so that the spirits of people could evolve faster during their incarnations on earth christ also hinted on the plurality of inhabited planets millennia before such a notion became widespread when he said in my father s house are many mansions as a consequence of it god s plan is much more complex than mankind can think of except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god christ s moral is also strongly discussed especially the sermon of the mount kardec argues that assuming that we only live once the apparent injustice of the world must be a reflection of god s injustice on the other hand considering that we live many times and that we carry from one life to the next the missions we left unfulfilled the guilt for the wrongs we did against others etc the apparent injustice of the world reflects the compensation of the wrong done in previous lives kardec proposes the law of cause and effect an occidentalised version of the hindu concept of karma and reinforces the monstruosity of homicide and suicide as the greatest sins against the law of god the gospel proposed the notion that adhering to christ s teachings was a way to get rid of suffering if not immediately in a later life relying solely on the morality proposed by god we fulfil our missions in the world stop accumulating guilt by doing wrong to others and start repairing our past sins kardec chose this specific verse because according to spiritism to follow the teachings of christ is much easier and leads us to more comfort than refusing them all suffering comes from denying to do what god wants us to that s why christ s yoke is light but the central point of the chapter is that the spiritist doctrine being an expansion and a correction of the central teachings of christ is the consolation once promised by him therefore salvation is not seen as the promotion to a heaven but in the literal sense other christian virtues like modesty humility and others are also examined and exhorted but blessed are the meek is presented in a quite unusual way this chapter explains why did christ promise inheritance on earth to the meek his thesis is that once everyone follows the teachings of christ the present situation in which most worldly goods are under the control of wicked people will be reverted this agrees with chapter 3 in which kardec demonstrates that christ did teach that there are many worlds and that as a consequence there are more and less evolved worlds the adoption of christian principles makes a world evolve and become more pleasant to live divine justice is presented as an extended and more thorough implementation of the lex talionis we are submitted to the same things we do unto others so that we learn that they are wrong so if we are merciful god will have mercy on us too the principle that thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself is seen then also as a protective measure to ensure us against suffering in the future this chapter also argues that love must be taken into action otherwise it is not love it also deals with the separation between the state and the church as expressed by christ saying render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesar s and unto god the things that are god s according to spiritism charity must benefit anyone that needs love your enemies regardless of faith a significant moral improvement not yet universalised today because of this doctrine spiritism should not proselitise as proselitism could cause people to think that the spiritist centres did only help those ready to accept the doctrine however the central point of the chapter is that love must be universal not limited by our preferences or affections kardec suggests that christ may have really meant to say love even your enemies that is love should be extended to them not started by them one curiosity about this chapter is the extensive treaty on duels because they were popular in france then helping the others is further approached when commenting christ saying let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth the ideal situation is when the help is completely dissociated from any religious practice in most spiritist centres that adhere to kardec s teachings charity has a different schedule than members meetings and not a word is told about any doctrine except for a vague invitation to come around whenever you want to visit us or to seek help if you need which does not necessarily imply on coming to the meetings but merely coming to meet the people you eventually befriend there another central teaching closely related to the above is that we shouldn t expect people to give us anything in return to see them better should be our return while the catholic church usually explains many are called but few are chosen as an allusion to the minority of christians that choose to be ordained spiritism explains the party of the king matthew 22 as a representation of how israel was called by god but few of the israelites effectively obeyed the call and therefore were chosen the parable is explained as a representation of spiritual life we are constantly called by god but every day few of us take heed of the call this chapter is often used as a justification of why spiritism does not bother to become a major religion provided that it survives spiritism was accused of lax morality because of its tolerance towards women not only did kardec accept them as equal to men before god but effectively published that the spirits said that a man may chose to live as woman or vice versa to attain greater improvement sex in spiritism is a transitional biological trait that exists among humans but may be different or absent in other intelligent species of the universe most of the mediums that channelled for kardec were women as well as some of the early leaders of spiritism the tolerance extended to marriage as well when christ said shall man not divide what god has united is not seen as binding god has established marriage it is important for the improvement of mankind now but it will eventually cease to be divorce is possible because the union provided by god is spiritual not legal man cannot break a union that is united by god so any union that ends was not united by him therefore the indissolubility of marriage is relative because there are marriages based on misrepresentation of love coercion on any or both the nubents or simply by mistake when a person marries someone and later discovers a sound reason why the wedding should have never taken place spiritism accepts divorced people without any discrimination and accepts that they have the right to marry again although it states that divorce should be an exception not a rule some other aspects detailed by christ which become clearer when studied in the light of spiritism are faith moves mountains although miracles in the common meaning do not exist god effectively helps us and prayer can change our lives for better though it does not actually move mountains the last hour workers a late repentance is ok if sincere because we will have another life to pay for the wrong we did and if we have enough time to repair some of the evil we spread our future may be less demanding there will be false christs and false prophets deals with the usual accusation of apostasy and persuades the reader that false christs and false prophets are not the proponents of spiritism but those who uphold religious truths that contradict the core of the christian message the last two doctrinal chapters of the the gospel according to spiritism come back to specifically spiritist themes freely ye have received freely give establishes the rules why no religious service should be charged at all as both the word of god and his miracles interventions are

 id=4443073 title loss of right in english law nonfiltered 773 processed 765 dbindex 1480778 in the english law of tort loss of right is a new heading of potential liability arising as a matter of policy to counteract limitations perceived in the more traditional rules of causation loss of a right recent medical negligence cases suggest tacit recognition of a more rights based approach to damage under this approach claimants who cannot establish causation using the traditional but for rules may nevertheless recover if they can show that in failing to fully advise of the risks inherent in treatment a defendant has deprived them of the right either to choose a more experienced doctor or to defer the date of the treatment in chester v afshar 2004 ukhl 41 the claimant was advised by the defendant surgeon to undergo surgery which carried a small 1 2 but unavoidable risk of a seriously adverse result inherent in the procedure and not dependent on any characteristics of the patient the surgeon did not warn her of that known risk and she suffered serious nerve damage which left her partially paralysed there was no evidence of negligence in the surgery itself the alleged breach of duty was the failure to warn of the risk and the claimant had to prove that but for the failure to warn her she would not have had the surgery lord hope said it is plain that the but for test is not in itself a sufficient test of causation para 72 but accepted that a solution to this problem which is in miss chester s favour cannot be based on conventional causation principles para 81 nevertheless he thought that he issue of causation cannot be separated from issues about policy para 85 and questioned whether in the unusual circumstances of this case justice required the normal approach to causation to be modified given that the issue which had arisen in this case raised an issue of legal policy which a judge must decide the general view is that patient autonomy must be respected which is why the law has imposed a duty on doctors to give comprehensive information so that the patient can make an informed choice as to whether to have the operation if there are known risks some might find the choice whether to consent easy but others would find the choice difficult and would wish to consider all options before taking the decision not to enforce the duty to warn of known risks would render the duty useless in the cases where it might be needed most lord steyn said at para 19 t is a distinctive feature of the present case that but for the surgeon s negligent failure to warn the claimant of the small risk of serious injury the actual injury would not have occurred when it did and the chance of it occurring on a subsequent occasion was very small it could therefore be said that the breach of the surgeon resulted in the very injury about which the claimant was entitled to be warned in general it is not desirable to depart from established principles of causation except for good reasons the lords held the right of autonomy and dignity justified a modification of the general rule in this case cf chappel v hart 1998 195 clr 232 in australia stevens argues that this decision is problematic suppose that a car being driven at an excessive speed is struck by a falling tree and a passenger is injured it does not matter whether the risk of falling trees was foreseeable e g because of prevailing weather conditions that risk is not increased by driving too fast the purpose of the rule imposing a duty to drive safely is to avoid traffic accidents not falling trees in chester v afshar the surgeon s breach of duty has not caused the patient to run any greater risk if the purpose of the duty is solely to enable the patient to make an informed choice about whether to have the operation at all the claimant s argument should fail as lord hoffmann says at para 31 this argument is about as logical as saying that if one had been told on entering a casino that the odds on no 7 coming up at roulette were only 1 in 37 one would have gone away and come back next week or gone to a different casino although it is true that a patient may wish to take time to discuss the matter with family and friends and possibly seek a second opinion the ultimate decision does not change the nature of the risk it seems that the majority of the lords wish to create an exception because the opportunity to reflect is itself deserving of respect references cane peter 1999 atiyah s accidents compensation and the law sixth edition chapter 5 cambridge cambridge

 id=8679345 title cosmological meaning of human life nonfiltered 783 processed 775 dbindex 1480788 premise there are the need to consider if the occurrence of the self awareness of people just 13 billions years after so called big bang and evoked by conscious decisions fast and permanent drive to understand everything and progress in technology is random recently these considerations and trials of the formulation of the world view incorporating phenomena of life and consciousness in cosmological models of the universe led to the theory of necessity of people s participation in reoccurence of sub universe its thesis expressed in another words states people will create a new sub universe or people go to be the new demiurge the essential concept of this theory is illustrated intuitively by fig 1 authors lee smolin who developed the theory of cosmological natural selection suggests that universes fecund universes evolve in favor of the production of black holes louis crane goes one step futher and maintains that universes could be fine tuned for life by intelligent beings themselves manufacturing new universes alan guth and michio kaku also have speculated that a civilization at the top of the kardashev scale might create fine tuned universes in a continuation of the evolutionary drive to exist in the light of a guth s and l crane s speculations the distant progeny of people will play the role of plato s demiurge even the most generalized version of the multiverse theory published recently by a known system scientist ervin laszlo see references who coined the notion of metaverse must be confronted with the thesis formulated in the premise to this entry laszlo posits that the quantum vacuum is the fundamental energy and information carrying field that informs not just the current universe but all universes past and present he believes that this kind of field can explain why our universe is so improbably fine tuned as to form galaxies and conscious life forms and why evolution is an informed not random process the presented theory posits however that people intelligent inhabitans of past and present universes are involved in the process of the mentioned improbably fine tuning the authors of the theory argue that occurrence of consciousness as a new neuro physiological phenomenon is not random they maintain that anybody of us is indispensable for the realization of an extremely important task we are indispensable to succeed to reproduce the new real world people in the context of the evolving universe in details the authors of the theory argue that the actual phase of the development of the universe characterized by occurrence of the self awareness of people should be understand in the context of the evolving universe the contemporary cosmologists maintain that the universe comes out from primary singularity it means from a very dense bunch of matter or quantum foam the singularity existed above time during the first cosmologic era the primary physical particles appeared the early universe was composed from hydrogen and helium more heavy elements occurred inside of the older stars we know already that many stellar systems are characterized by the presence of planets at the surface of the planets at last on our planet so called biological life has emerged recently after 13 billions year of the cosmic evolution the homo sapiens sapiens appeared human beings are characterized by the self awareness it is almost improbably that the occurrence of biological life and consciousness was random it is rather a cosmic necessity the existence of a galaxy is probably the indispensable condition it would be difficult to imagine a planetary stellar system with the biological life on the surface of the planet existing in the intergalactic cosmic void if we will admit that the biological life is a cosmic necessity the quick formation of galaxies in the expanding universe should be comprehended as an important step in the creation of the elementary conditions for the occurrence of the biological life the appearance of human self awareness is indispensable to take decisions about important acts related to the fate of human beings people are inquisitive and unconsciously motivated to increase the knowledge and technological abilities it enables them to develop the communication and memorizing systems they quickly transforms our planet in a kind of a huge global brain it is only first step to much more far reaching goals just now people want to analyze record and understand the genetic code in fact they want to understand the code representation of everything is emulation of people on second level of implementation necessary frank tipler the author of the anthropic cosmological principle see references is also the author of the book sub title the physics of immortality modern cosmology god and the resurrection of the dead see references he presents in this book probably unique other

matter of the collapsing universe it will enable the emulation reconstruction in fact resurrection of all people who lived before frank tipler s theory works only on the assumption that the time space of the universe is closed see big crunch and that it will collapse in the future in 1998 after the formulation of tipler s theory in 1995 astronomers found strong arguments that our universe is open see stephen perlmutter and co discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the universe 1998 nature 391 6662 and that the time space will expand endlessly big freeze so the theory of necessity of people s participation in reoccurence of sub universe take into account that probably our universe will expand adulterate and freeze endlessly the authors of the theory believe however that people intuitively try to escape the disastrous fate of the civilization living in the attenuating and freezing universe the intelligent inhabitants of the present universe have probably unconscious drive to understand everything and develop high technology especially information processing technology see the anticipation of so called technological singularity probably it is the begining of the mentioned drive to build the macro computer and to implement the essence especially brains and human psyche on so called second level of implementation the development of the global internet the urge to construct so called virtual reality or simulated reality and the main postulate of all religions about further existence in other world as well the recent vision of futurologists vernor vinge ray kurzweil and many science fiction writers greg egan stephen baxter what give usually a good insights push authors of the theory to prediction that really people will scan themselves and emulate in the cyberspace it seems that it is necessary to obtain a much faster and intense development of the thinking and cognition as well dispersed conscious inteligent system integrated with the material substance of galaxies the ultimate goal of people probably the ultimate goal of people is to do something with the sad vision of cooling dilatating infinitely expanded time space of our universe probably the descendant of us will try to utilize a massive black hole as a tool appropriate to begin the next offspring universe mighty knowledge technology and power is necessary however to program and tune the characteristics of the next big little bang in such a manner that ensures the offspring universe will also obey the anthropic principle it would cause the similar evolution of the offspring universe who should lead to the occurrence of human beings that will signify in fact the reincarnation of the human species thus people and their descendants of the present universe will want to master the ability to tune the next big bang therefore they need to decode genomic information and also the patterns for all reality including the pattern of the physical and chemical characteristics of matter the code representation of all objects should be determined people who know scientific endeavors will agree that in fact the trial of the understanding of everything has already began metaphysical importance of the theory many authors presented similar speculations on subjects of fine tuned universe ultimate fate of the universe strong final version of the anthropic principle intelligent design and others hitherto the authors of these speculations omit however the role of people in the fate of universe it is astonishing because from the another hand people are desperate by the lack of opinion or theories related to meaning of their existence furthermore the theory of necessity of people s participation in reoccurence of sub universe unawares indicates for the possibility to consider unification of religious and cosmological concepts it is illustrated by fig 2 which suggests the rational for emulation of people on so called second level of implementation what means simply some kind of their resurrection frank tipler s theory foresaw this possibility for the cosmological model of the closed universe fig 2 illustrates how the same concept is usefulness in compass of similar theory but taking into account the cosmological model of the open universe the phases of the evolution of the universe mentioned on the upper part of the scheme are scientifically substantiated the elements of the cycle mentioned on the lower part of the scheme are rather speculative how future progeny of people will realize the tuning of next singularity probably will be yet long the matter of hypothetical speculations theory of necessity of people s participation in reoccurence of sub universe in some sense is opposite to the concept of intelligent design here the sub universe is designed by the former universe it resolves old metaphysical problem that the designer cannot be simpler that his product the theory implies also third possibility to the metaphysical and religious controversy instead of random occurrence or the creation by god the possibility exists that the universe was created by conscious inhabitants of former past version of the universe who played the role of demiurge conceived as in old plato s metaphysics importance of the theory for psychological and social condition of people the presented theory restores the meaning of the human life it explains why the effort of people is valuable and that this effort will be rewarded by the possibility of reoccurence the theory emerged from the trial of the unification of biological and cosmological notions however it has implications for the emotional condition of people contemporary people need well justified tasks which point out the important mission creating

 id=7483320 title marketing ethics nonfiltered 790 processed 782 dbindex 1480795 marketing ethics is the area of applied ethics which deals with the moral principles behind the operation and regulation of marketing some areas of marketing ethics ethics of advertising and promotion overlap with media ethics fundamental issues in marketing ethics frameworks of analysis for marketing ethics possible frameworks value orientated framework analysing ethical problems on the basis of the values which they infringe e g honesty autonomy privacy transparency an example of such an approach is the ama statement of ethics stakeholder orientated framework analysing ethical problems on the basis of whom they affect e g consumers competitors society as a whole process orientated framework analysing ethical problems in terms of the categories used by marketing specialists e g research price promotion placement none of these frameworks allow by themselves a convenient and complete categorisation of the great variety of issues in marketing ethics power based analysis contrary to popular impressions not all marketing is adversarial and not all marketing is stacked in favour of the marketer in marketing the relationship between producer consumer or buyer seller can be adversarial or cooperative for an example of cooperative marketing see relationship marketing if the marketing situation is adversarial another dimension of difference emerges describing the power balance between producer consumer or buyer seller power may be concentrated with the producer caveat emptor but factors such as over supply or legislation can shift the power towards the consumer caveat vendor identifying where the power in the relationship lies and whether the power balance is relevant at all are important to understanding the background to an ethical dilemma in marketing ethics is marketing inherently evil a popularist anti marketing stance commonly discussed on the blogosphere and popular literature is that any kind of marketing is inherently evil the position is based on the argument that marketing necessarily commits at least one of three wrongs damaging personal autonomy the victim of marketing in this case is the intended buyer whose right to self determination is infringed causing harm to competitors excessively fierce competition and unethical marketing tactics are especially associated with saturated markets manipulating social values the victim in this case is society as a whole or the environment as well the argument is that marketing promotes consumerism and waste see also affluenza ethical consumerism anti consumerism specific issues in marketing ethics market research ethical danger points in market research include invasion of privacy stereotyping stereotyping occurs because any analysis of real populations needs to make approximations and place individuals into groups however if conducted irresponsibly stereotyping can lead to a variety of ethical undesirable results in the ama statement of ethics stereotyping is countered by the obligation to show respect acknowledge the basic human dignity of all stakeholders market audience ethical danger points include targeting the vulnerable e g children the elderly excluding potential customers from the market selective marketing is used to discourage demand from undesirable market sectors or disenfranchise them altogether examples of unethical market exclusion or selective marketing are past industry attitudes to the gay ethnic minority and obese plus size markets contrary to the popular myth that ethics and profits do not mix the tapping of these markets has proved highly profitable for example 20 of us clothing sales are now plus size another example is the selective marketing of health care so that unprofitable sectors i e the elderly will not attempt to take benefits to which they are entitled a further example of market exclusion is the pharmaceutical industry s exclusion of developing countries from aids drugs examples of marketing which unethically targets the elderly include living trusts time share fraud mass marketing fraud and others the elderly hold a disproportionate amount of the world s wealth and are therefore the target of financial exploitation in the case of children the main products are unhealthy food fashionware and entertainment goods children are a lucrative market children 12 and under spend more than 11 billion of their own money and influence family spending decisions worth another 165 billion but are not capable of resisting or understanding marketing tactics at younger ages children don t understand persuasive intent until they are eight or nine years old at older ages competitive feelings towards other children are stronger than financial sense the practice of extending children s marketing from television to the schoolground is also controversial see marketing in schools the following is a select list of online articles sharon beder

include emerging markets in developing countries where the public may not be sufficiently aware of skilled marketing ploys transferred from developed countries and where conversely marketers may not be aware how excessively powerful their tactics may be see nestle infant milk formula scandal another vulnerable group are mentally unstable consumers the definition of vulnerability is also

ethics in advertising and promotion content ethical pitfalls in advertising and promotional content include issues over truth and honesty in the 1940 s and 1950 s tobacco used to be advertised as promoting health today an advertiser who fails to tell the truth not only offends against morality but also against the law however the law permits puffery a legal term the difference between mere puffery and fraud is a slippery slope the problem is the slippery slope by which variations on puffery can descend fairly quickly to lies see main article false advertising issues with violence sex

advertising and advertising likely to be seen by children taste and controversy the advertising of certain products may strongly offend some people while being in the interests of others examples include feminine hygiene products hemorrhoid and constipation medication the advertising of condoms has become acceptable in the interests of aids prevention but are nevertheless seen by some as promoting promiscuity some companies have actually marketed themselves on the basis of controversial advertising see benetton sony has also frequently attracted criticism for unethical content portrayals of jesus which enfuriated religious groups racial innuendo in marketing black and white versions of its psp product graffiti adverts in major us cities negative advertising techniques such as attack ads in negative advertising the advertiser highlights the disadvantages of competitor products rather than the advantages of their own the methods are most familiar from the political sphere see negative campaigning delivery channels direct marketing is the most controversial of advertising channels particularly when approaches are unsolicited tv commercials and direct mail are common examples electronic spam and telemarketing push the borders of ethics and legality more strongly shills and astroturfers are examples of ways for delivering a marketing message under the guise of independent product reviews and endorsements or creating supposedly independent watchdog or review organisations for example fake reviews can be published on amazon shills are primarily for message delivery but they can also be used to drive up prices in auctions such as ebay auctions the use of ethics as a marketing tactic business ethics has been an increasing concern among larger companies at least since the 1990 s major corporations increasingly fear the damage to their image associated with press revelations of unethical practices marketers have been among the fastest to perceive the market s preference for ethical companies often moving faster to take advantage of this shift in consumer taste this results in the expropriation of ethics itself as a selling point or a component of a corporate image the body shop is an example of a company which marketed itself and its entire product range solely on an ethical message the body shop s only real product is honesty jon entine in a 1996 ethics audit of the company however the story of the body shop ended with increasing criticism of a gap between its morals and its practices greenwash is an example of a strategy used to make a company appear ethical when its unethical practices continue liberation marketing is another strategy whereby a product can masquerade behind an image that appeals to a range of values including ethical values related to lifestyle and anti consumerism liberation marketing takes the old mass culture critique consumerism as conformity fully into account acknowledges it addresses it and solves it liberation marketing imagines consumers breaking free from the old enforcers of order tearing loose from the shackles with which capitalism has bound us escaping the routine of bureaucracy and hierarchy getting in touch with our true selves and finally finding authenticity that holiest of consumer grails thomas frank marketing strategy the main theoretical issue here is the debate between free markets and regulated markets in a truly free market any participant can make or change the rules however when new rules are invented which shift power too suddenly or too far other participants may respond with accusations of unethical behaviour rather than modifying their own behaviour to suit which they might not be able to anyway most markets are not fully free the real debate is as to the appropriate extent of regulation case california electricity crisis which demonstrates how constant innovation of new marketing strategies by companies such as enron outwitted the regulatory

august 1919 the police act 1919 passed into law only token opposition from a minority of labour mps was voiced in parliament preliminaries in 1870 it is recorded that police in newcastle on tyne were in dispute with their local watch committee over conditions of work and low pay though there was no withdrawal from duty two years later in 1872 179 men of the metropolitan police refused to report for duty their refusal was over the poor conditions of their service and low pay the same as those in newcastle on tyne the policemen that refused duty were back on the beat in a matter of hours of the 179 men that refused duty sixty nine were dismissed from the force the rest were after apologising for their conduct were allowed back on duty the end result was an improvement in the pay and conditions what was significant about this action was that a precedent had been set direct action could bring results however successful this stoppage was in 1872 it did not lead to a union being formed indeed the most of the policemen involved in this stoppage would not have considered forming a union the act of withdrawing from duty was considered as an act of mutiny which reflects the quasi military nature of the police despite the dismissals in the strike of 1872 members of the metropolitan force took part in a further stoppage in july 1890 this time the cause was police pensions the government argued that it could not be held to ransom yet as an illustration of how seriously the government took the loyalty of the police the police pensions bill 1890 was drafted and rushed through parliament in a matter of weeks the crime act the crime act 1885 had made it illegal for anyone to interfere with a policeman in the course of his duty thus anyone calling on a policeman to stop work or support a fellow worker would be guilty of a criminal offence this slowed down the formation of a union but did not stop it the september 1913 issue of the police review carried an anonymous letter informing its readers that a union was being formed thus in secret policemen began to do the unthinkable and join a union it had to be done in secret simply because anyone found to be a member was instantly dismissed from the force however the fledgling union did strike a cord of appeal and membership grew on the eve of the strike in 1918 the nuppo were able to claim a membership of 10000 policemen the force strength of the metropolitan police numbered only 12000 the establishment of a union amongst the police caused the commissioner sir edward henry to issue an official police order banning the union and promising instant dismissal to anyone found to be associated with it the government also took a hostile stance with regard to the police to having a union the home secretary and the commissioner assumed that the threat of dismissal from the force and loss of pension rights was an adequate deterrent nevertheless by the august of 1918 the mood of the men was so totally misread that the metropolitan police went on strike leaving london the capital to the mercy of the mob dismissal of police captain theil the dismissal of police captain theil a union member of some prominence was the incident that actually sparked the 1918 strike he was dismissed on the grounds of his union activities however this was only a spark for all the grievances over pay and conditions the authorities grossly under estimated the strength of support amongst the rank and file for positive action to further their own grievances and to defend constable theil the day before the strike began police superintendents reported at their weekly meeting with the commissioner that all was quiet in the force the strike of 1918 the executive of the nuppo claimed a rise in pay improved war bonuses extension of pension rights to include policemen s widows and a shortening of the pension entitlement period an allowance for children of school age was demanded however the most important point on the table was the official recognition of the nuppo as the police union furthermore they informed the authorities that unless their demands were met by midnight on the 29th of august they would call a strike the strike of 1918 caught the government off balance at a time of increasing unrest on the domestic scene and internationally at a very precarious period the results the swiftness of the strike and the solidarity of the men shocked the government by the next day august 30th 12000 men which was virtually the whole complement of men in the metropolitan force were on strike by the morning of the 30th troops had been deployed at key points across the capital the first imperative of the government was to get the police back on duty on the 31st lloyd george who had been in france when the strike started called a meeting with the executive of the nuppo by the end of the afternoon the strike had been settled all ranks were to receive an increase of 13 shillings per week in pensionable pay taking the minimum to 43 shillings the right to a pension was reduced from thirty years service to twenty six years service and widows were awarded a pension of 10 shillings a war bonus of 12 shillings per week was granted and a grant of 2 shillings and sixpence p for each child of school age was given constable theil was reinstated all the demands of the nuppo had been met except official recognition of the union in the provinces there had been no strikes nevertheless policemen in manchester threatened to strike they were offered and accepted the same terms given to the metropolitan police by october several other police forces around the country had been given pay increases an immediate consequence of the strike was the increase in union membership it jumped from 10000 in august to 50000 by the november of 1918 as far as union recognition was concerned the prime minister lloyd george had said that this could not be granted in time of war the fact that lloyd george had met and settled the dispute with the union leaders was viewed by james marston the union president as de facto recognition of the union the government by granting the demands made on pay and conditions implied the promise of union recognition as a consequence of the 1918 strike sir edward henry the commissioner of the metropolitan police resigned his replacement was general sir nevil macready a serving soldier he immediately began reorganising the command structure of the police as far as macready was concerned the days of the nuppo were numbered he had the comforting knowledge that given the circumstances in which his appointment was made he was to have carte blanche in his dealings with the nuppo and its officials macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union he refused to recognise both james marston the president and jack hayes the general secretary of nuppo as far as macready was concerned the police had had a grievance which was now settled and nuppo remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with in an attempt to circumnavigate the union macready established representative broads for police officers by instituting the boards macready had neither consulted the government or the union the boards would consist of one delegate from each of the twenty six divisions within the metropolitan force all of whom were to be elected by secret ballot the nuppo executive demanded once again that the nuppo be officially recognised with the approval of the home office macready lifted the ban in police orders that barred policemen joining the nuppo with the addendum that membership of the union should not interfere with police discipline or implore policemen to withdraw from duty the government announced that a committee be convened under lord desborough that would look at all aspects police forces of england wales and scotland one of the things it highlighted was the inconsistency in police pay at the time there was no uniform pay structure for the police local watch committees were the sole arbiters of police pay the pay of agricultural workers and unskilled labourers had out stripped that of the police the desborough committee recorded that the pay for the average constable serving in a provincial force with five years service who was married with to children would earn 2 pounds 15 shillings and this included all their allowances which included rent and a child allowance the desborough committee cited examples that a street sweeper in newcastle on tyne was on the same rate of pay as a constable in the provincial force all the rest of the examples of which there were ten were paid more six of those were higher than the pay of the metropolitan police therefore in respect of pay and conditions lord desborough was quite sympathetic to the plight of the ordinary policeman so the pay awards recommended by his committee were quite generous for their day by the end of 1918 and into 1919 it seemed that all the unions large and small were active in disputes the length and breath of britain by mid 1919 there were strikes or the threat of strikes in the docks the railways and the transport workers there was a nation wide bakers strike in glasgow there was a rent strike by council tenants in the press there were claims that bolshevik revolution had arrived in britain the government could not afford the possibility of the police aligning themselves with another union or the tuc police loyalty in such a dangerous time was paramount and the government was determined that it would not be caught napping a second time the police bill 1919 was the final piece of legislation the put and end to nuppo the police bill established the police federation to replace the nuppo under the bills provision nuppo was outlawed as a representative body for the police furthermore the police were forbidden by law from belonging to a trade union the reaction of the nuppo was predictable it was bound to be considering the content of the bill the union had no option but to fight however this time it was the union that was to misread the mood of the men they called for a strike out of a force of 18200 men in the metropolitan police only 1156 men went on strike the tale in liverpool was a different one however liverpool city police supported the strike in 1919 the complement of the liverpool city police was 1874 men of these 954 went on strike the grievances of policemen in liverpool were for many years ignored by a local watch committee which was noted for it disciplinarian attitude which helped to fostered the mood for action the poor conditions in the liverpool police were almost legendary amongst other forces in england on the day the strike started in liverpool striking policemen formed into ranks and decided to march on police stations around the city in an attempt to persuade those no on strike to join them firstly the police strikers who found themselves coming to blows with fellow officers that had not joined the strike some of who were union members the consequences for the people of liverpool however were far greater than those in the capital left without an affective police presence public order in some of the working class areas of liverpool broke down and the locals went on a spree of looting and vandalism this orgy of looting continued for around three or four days before the military aided by non striking policemen brought the situation under control at the cost of several lives and more than two hundred arrests for looting the final outcome of the strike was that every man who had gone on strike right across the country was dismissed from their respective forces not one striker was reinstated anywhere and all lost their pension entitlements the eventual outcome of the strikes of 1918 and 1919 were beneficial to policemen firstly the police received an increase in pay that doubled their wages more than this however was that the government were force to take notice of the police and their grievances and in doing so established the police federation importantly the two strikes by the police had also made the government realise the importance of the police in terms of their own stability after 1919 the police were never again taken quite as for granted as they had been prior to 1918 articles jones owen the spirit of

 id=1018814 title meta nonfiltered 831 processed 823 dbindex 1480837 meta greek after beyond is a common english prefix used to indicate a concept which is an abstraction from another concept used to analyze the latter for example metaphysics refers to the book that came after aristotle s work on nature physics in the classical ordering and by extension to the philosophical domain of this book but meta language refers to a type of language or system which describes i e is about language in epistemology the prefix meta is used to mean about its own category for example metadata are data about data who has produced it when what format the data are in and so on similarly metamemory in psychology means an individual s knowledge about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it any subject can be said to have a meta theory which is the theoretical consideration of its foundations and methods another slightly different interpretation of this term is about but not on for example a grammar is considered as a metalanguage a meta answer is not a real answer but a reply such as this is not a good question i suggest to ask your professor here we have such concepts as meta reasoning and meta knowledge from the hypercomputing dictionary a prefix meaning one layer of information removed if x is some concept then meta x is data about or processes operating on x the dual directionality of meta can be illustrated in the concept of an explanation if someone says what does that mean one can offer them either a definition and explanation or an example either are accepted in organic chemistry meta along with ortho and para is used to distinguish the three types of isomer of disubstituted benzenes it indicates that the substituents are at locants 1 and 3 it is printed in italic type and is often abbreviated as m in compound names for example the compound name meta xylene is equivalent to m xylene etymology the prefix is derived by back formation from the ancient greek preposition and prefix meta which meant either after or beside this prefix occurred in the name of one part of aristotle s works the metaphysics which originally meant simply the parts that come after physics the title was later understood to mean that which is beyond physics and meta was thus re analyzed as meaning beyond quine and hofstadter the oed cites uses of the meta prefix as beyond about such as meta economics and meta philosophy going back to 1917 however these formations are directly parallel to the original metaphysics and metaphysical that is as a prefix to general nouns fields of study or adjectives going by the oed citations it began to be used with specific nouns in connection with mathematical logic sometime before 1929 a notable early citation is quine s 1937 use of the word metatheorem where meta clearly has the modern meaning of an x about x note that earlier uses of meta economics and even metaphysics do not have this doubled conceptual structure they are about or beyond x but they do not constitute an x note also that this modern meaning allows for self reference since if something is about the category to which it belongs it can be about itself it is therefore no coincidence that we find quine a mathemetician interested in self reference using it douglas hofstadter in his 1979 book gödel escher bach and in the less popular sequel metamagical themas popularized this meaning of the term this book which deals extensively with self reference and touches on quine and his work was influential in many computer related subcultures and is probably largely responsible for the popularity of the prefix for its use as a solo term and for the many recent coinages which use it hofstadter uses the meta as a stand alone word both as an adjective and as a directional preposition going meta a term he coins for the old rhetorical trick of taking a debate or analysis to another level of abstraction as in this debate isn t going anywhere this book is also probably responsible for the direct association of meta with self reference as opposed to just abstraction the sentence this sentence contains thirty six letters along with the sentence it is embedded in are examples of sentences that reference themselves in this way the metacorder the metacorder is a theoretical device described in the short story of the same name by tristan parker as the story describes the metacorder is a computational device which does nothing other than monitoring its own activities while in practice this would result in an endless loop similar to the print print quine the story takes this idea and gives it a sort of intelligence which allows the metacorder to consider and judge its own actions this is an example of constrained writing both in that the story describes a single object over the course of several pages and that it is done entirely in the voice of such an object being described this double rule allows much playfulness however and the story ranges from realistic technical descriptions to vague poetic musings while still keeping the same voice throughout words using the term meta or meta common uses of the english prefix include metadata meta tag or an html tag metacognition meta discussion meta ethics metafiction meta joke meta knight meta knowledge metalanguage metalogic metamathematics metamechanics metanarrative metaphilosophy metaverse metacharacter meta modeling other uses more closely follow the greek meaning for example metaphysics metanomic metathesis see also

 id=414275 title prefecture china nonfiltered 861 processed 852 dbindex 1480867 prefecture in the context of china is used to refer to several unrelated political divisions in both ancient and modern china in a modern context prefecture level abbreviated region is used to refer to a level of division between the province and county levels the prefecture level is the second level in the administrative hierarchy of the people s republic of china there are four kinds of prefecture level divisions prefectures prefecture level cities autonomous prefectures and leagues the modern chinese prefecture is a relatively recent creation when the word prefecture is encountered in literature referring to ancient china it refers to either the xian or the zhou which are two other types of administrative division prefecture prefectures pinyin dìq are governed by administrative offices xíngzhèngg ngsh led by a head of office xíngzhèngsh uzh ng appointed by the province at one point prefectures were the most common type of prefecture level division today they have been mostly converted into prefecture level cities and the trend is still ongoing there are 17 prefectures remaining in mainland china mostly in xinjiang and tibet prefecture level city main article prefecture level city prefecture level cities pinyin dìjíshì are cities that are given prefecture status and the right to govern surrounding counties in practice prefecture level cities are so large that they are just like any other administrative division and not cities in the traditional sense of the word at all prefecture level cities are the most common type of prefecture level division in mainland china today league main article league inner mongolia leagues pinyin méng are the prefectures of inner mongolia the name comes from an ancient mongolian administrative unit which were used during the qing dynasty in mongolia during the roc rule the leagues had status equivalent to provinces leagues contain banners equivalent to counties just like prefectures most leagues have been replaced by prefecture level cities there are only 3 leagues remaining in inner mongolia autonomous prefecture main article autonomous prefecture autonomous prefectures pinyin zìzhìzh u either have over 50 of the population with ethnic minorities or are historically resided by significant minorities all autonomous prefectures are mostly dominated in population by the han chinese the official name of an autonomous prefecture includes the most dominant minority in that region sometimes two rarely three for example a kazakh kazak in official naming system prefecture may be called kazak zizhizhou like all other prefecture level divisions autonomous prefectures are divided into county level divisions there is one exception ili kazak autonomous prefecture contains two prefectures of its own under the constitution of the people s republic of china autonomous prefectures cannot be abolished development zone development zones pinyin k if q were temporary prefecture level divisions chongqing was a development zone before it became a municipality and two development zones were set up within chongqing immediately after it became a municipality these divisions were temporary and no longer exist legal status the constitution of the people s republic of china does not endorse any prefecture level division except for autonomous prefectures prefectures and leagues are not at all mentioned provinces are explicitly stated to be divided directly into counties the constitution does not explicit endorse the existence of prefecture level cities but it does mention that comparatively large cities are divided into counties and districts however there are only 49 prefecture level cities that have been designated as comparatively large as a result the vast majority of prefecture level cities do not have the constitutional basis for governing districts and counties the wholesale conversion of prefectures into prefecture level cities has resulted in the phenomenon of cities containing cities prefecture level cities containing county level cities there is no legal basis for this not even for the 49 comparatively large cities thus the county level cities technically do not belong to the prefecture level city but are instead governed on behalf of the province by the prefecture level city though in practice the county level cities do indeed belong to their governing prefecture level cities ancient sense in the history of the political divisions of china the word prefecture has been applied onto two unrelated types of division the xian and the zhou in general the word prefecture is applied onto xian for the period before the sui dynasty and tang dynasty for the period after xian are called districts or counties while prefectures now refer to zhou xian xian were first established during the warring states period and have existed continuously ever since today they continue to form an important part of the political divisions of china xian has been translated using several english language terms in the context of ancient history district and prefecture are the most commonly used terms while county is generally used for more contemporary contexts see county china and taiwan for more information zhou zhou were first established during the han dynasty and were abolished only with the establishment of the republic of china zhou is generally translated as province or region for the period before the sui dynasty and prefecture for the period from the sui dynasty onwards the people s republic of china has revived the word zhou as part of the term zizhizhou which is translated as autonomous prefectures as described above see zhou political division for more information

success in the australian touring car championship and his four wins in the bathurst 1000 born in canada moffat first came to australia as a college student with his parents in the early 1960s and lived permanently in the country since the latter part of that decade when he embarked on his record setting racing career he had already raced in the united states before his move to australia his first race behind the wheel of a triumph tr3 1965 to 1971 moffat first entered the australian touring car championship atcc in 1965 driving a lotus cortina by 1969 he had become a regular competitor and his bright red coca cola sponsored trans am ford mustang was unmistakable at circuits around australia he would go on to win 101 atcc races in this car between 1969 and 1972 although moffat and many other drivers raced mustangs for atcc competition the five atcc titles from 1965 to 1969 were all won by mustangs this car was ineligible for the bathurst 500 later changed to bathurst 1000 which was restricted to series production cars and moffat made his debut in that race in a ford falcon xw gtho phase i in 1969 he and co driver alan hamilton finished 4th the following two years would see moffat come into his own as one of australia s most dominant race drivers and the falcon gtho as an almost unbeatable car for 1970 ford had made significant improvements to the falcon xw gtho phase ii over the previous year s model and moffat racing without a co driver took the car to two crushing victories in the 1970 and 1971 bathurst races in 1971 he became the first driver to lead the bathurst 500 from start to finish while driving the famed ford falcon xy gtho phase iii 1972 moffat looked headed for an historic third straight bathurst victory in 1972 when ford unveiled plans for a phase iv falcon gtho even faster and more brutal than the phase iii which moffat had taken to victory in 1971 the australian press caught wind of these plans however and headlines across the country screamed 160mph supercars on our roads facing pressure from the media and government not to produce this car as entering it at bathurst would also require at least 200 units to be sold at dealerships in australia ford scrapped production of the phase iv and forced moffat and other ford drivers to resort to year old phase iii cars for bathurst that year peter brock won the race that year for arch rival manufacturer holden after wet weather and brake dramas hobbled the fords and he and moffat would establish a rivalry of their own in the years to come 1973 to 1980 in 1973 the confederation of australian motorsport cams changed the rules for atcc and bathurst cars to allow racing modifications prior to 1973 cars had to be showroom standard and could not be modified ford smarting from the phase iv controversy the year before withdrew their factory teams from competition at the end of 1973 and forced moffat and others to form their own privateer teams despite having assisted moffat to victory in both the atcc title his first ever and at bathurst with co driver ian geoghegan that year moffat was the first winner of the bathurst race following its conversion from a 500 mile event to 1000km moffat struggled through the 1974 and 1975 seasons he failed to finish bathurst in those years and was only moderately competitive in atcc races in 1975 he drove a bmw 3 0csl with brian redman to win the sebring 12 hour although he failed to finish bathurst again in 1976 moffat returned to drive his falcon gt full time in the atcc that year and won his second title despite the setback of a transporter fire which destroyed his race car with several rounds left to run moffat re established his dominance in 1977 he won his second consecutive atcc title that year the third of his career but this performance was overshadowed by the crushing 1 2 victory of moffat and team mate colin bond at bathurst by the mid point of the race moffat and bond led by over six laps from the rest of the field late in the race moffat s car encountered brake problems and had to slow allowing bond to catch up for the cars to complete the final lap of the race side by side and cross the finish line in tandem with bond allowing moffat to stay barely in front this moment is remembered as one of the most famous in australian motor sport history and still regarded by many as ford s finest hour the following year moffat received an order of the british empire in 1978 for exceptional services to motor sport moffat was unable to repeat his 1977 successes over the following three years he retired from the 1978 1979 and 1980 bathurst races his last in the local ford product and did not win the atcc title in those years as holden began to gain a manufacturer s edge with their torana a9x which was lighter and more nimble than the heavy falcons in 1980 he competed in various cars and in various countries he drove a porsche 934 turbo to win the australian sports car championship he also drove at the lemans 24 hour race sharing a porsche 935 turbo with indycar legend bobby rahal where they were forced to withdraw whilst in fourth place he also did a guest drive for the marlboro holden dealer team taking 3rd place in the sandown 400km race the event was marked by the fact that it was moffat s second only time in a holden and that he was driving in the same team as his arch rival peter brock 1981 and beyond much to the dismay of his mostly ford biased fans moffat left the blue oval brand in 1981 to drive a peter stuyvesant sponsored mazda rx 7 as both the atcc and bathurst began to exhibit a shift towards lighter touring cars with less raw power moffat drove the rx 7 to four consecutive top six finishes at bathurst between 1981 and 1984 and won his fourth and final atcc title in 1983 moffat also competed at the daytona 24 hour race in an rx 7 taking a class win in 1982 with co drivers lee mulle and kathy rude that same year he again competed at lemans in a factory rx 7 based sportscar achieving taking a class win in 1985 he took his own rx 7 that he campaigned previously in australia to daytona for the 24 hour race sharing the car with australian drivers gregg hansford kevin bartlett and peter mcleod after sitting out the 1985 australian season moffat returned to bathurst for three more years in 1986 1987 and 1988 the first in a holden commodore with peter brock and the final brace in ford sierras with cosworth engines these cars dominated the atcc circuits for most of the late 1980s and won bathurst twice in 1988 and 1989 in 1987 after peter brock split with holden moffat purchased the vl commodore that brock had intended to take to europe to compete in the world touring car championship in the first round of the 1987 wtcc held in monza italy moffat and his co driver ex hdt driver john harvey took a surprise opening round win as a result of the leading bmw m3 s being disqualified later that year moffat and harvey drove the same commodore to 4th place outright and a class win at the spa 24 hour race moffat s last race was in 1989 driving with klaus niedzwiedz winning the fuji 500km race in japan he retired from competitive motor racing that year he has since worked as a tv commentator and a spokesman for bmw and appears at various ford club events across australia on february 2 2004 he received australian citizenship in a ceremony at the australian grand prix corporation offices in melbourne he had been eligible for citizenship since the early 1970s but in his own words one way or another i never followed it through the

 id=1895931 title bc stv nonfiltered 880 processed 870 dbindex 1480886 bc stv is a proposed voting system recommended by the citizens assembly on electoral reform for use in british columbia a member of the single transferable vote family of voting systems bc stv was narrowly defeated in a referendum in 2005 but will likely be re proposed in identical form in 2008 background the ruling liberal government put together the assembly and gave it a mandate to come up with new system of selecting mlas the assembly recommended this system and the liberal government put it to a referendum at the same time as the provincial election first referendum bc stv required 60 of the popular vote and 60 of the ridings to support in order for it to be passed it received 97 of the ridings but only 57 of the vote second referendum in the speech from the throne made to open the first session of the legislature after the 2005 election the campbell government clarified its next steps on electoral reform as follows the issue of electoral reform remains following the results of the referendum put before the public in may nearly 58 per cent of all citizens who cast a ballot in the recent referendum on electoral reform supported the proposed stv electoral system a solid majority supported stv in all but two of b c s 79 constituencies and yet that was not enough to pass according to the rules this legislature unanimously established your government has been clear that it does not intend to rewrite those rules after the fact or pretend that the vote for stv succeeded when it did not nor can it ignore the size of the double majority that voted to change our current electoral system to the stv model your government does not accept that the solution to a majority vote that failed to pass is to essentially ignore it and impose yet another electoral system it does not accept that the answer to the minority s rejection of the citizens assembly s proposal is to redo its work it does not accept that the 79 members of this assembly are any better qualified than the 161 members of the citizens assembly were to choose the best electoral model one task that was never assigned to the citizens assembly was to show precisely how its proposed stv model might apply on an electoral map this was arguably a design flaw in its terms of reference that in retrospect may have impacted how people voted in the referendum your government believes that establishing stv constituency boundaries may provide the public with a critical piece of information that was missing at the time of the referendum the government will recommend that shortcoming be rectified the legislature is obliged to appoint an electoral boundaries commission this session your government will use that opportunity to take the challenge of electoral reform to its ultimate conclusion the commission will also be asked to identify the best and fairest way to configure british columbia s electoral districts under the stv model the commission will be asked to submit its final report on electoral redistribution under both electoral systems by the spring of 2008 that information will be put before the public as part of an extensive effort to better inform british columbians about the two electoral options the current system and stv equal funding will be provided to support active information campaigns for supporters and detractors of each model the two models will be put to a province wide vote along with the applicable electoral boundaries in a referendum that will be held in tandem with the november 2008 municipal elections that question will be crafted by the government and will be debated and voted upon in this legislature all members including cabinet ministers will be free to speak to it and vote as they wish in establishing electoral boundaries it has been the practice that all members are invited to make representations to the electoral boundaries commission all members will be encouraged to also use that opportunity to comment on the relative merits of both electoral models under the boundaries proposed no one is obliged to support stv or remain silent if they have concerns the premier will remain neutral but all government members will be free to support or oppose either model in the final analysis the people will again decide not the politicians which electoral model and boundaries suit them best the people will have their final say on stv the same rules and thresholds that applied for passing stv in the recent referendum will apply in the november 2008 referendum whichever model succeeds is the model that will be employed to elect the next parliament on may 12th 2009 the government intends to launch a province wide enumeration prior to that date to ensure that the british columbia voters list is both up to date and accurate however on april 27 2006 premier gordon campbell said the referendum on electoral reform will now be held in tandem with the next provincial election in may 2009 system design candidates political parties may run up to as many candidates as there are available seats in each electoral district major parties will typically run several candidates though generally not more than they might expect to be successfully elected while smaller parties might run only single candidates the voter ranks their top choices 1 2 3 4 etc from the list of candidates and may rank or vote for as many or few candidates as they like a quota for the district is determined based on the number of valid ballots cast and the number of seats available in the district all the votes are counted and sorted by the voters first preferences those candidates with enough first preference votes to meet or exceed the quota are elected a multiple step vote counting and transfer process then ensues to determine the winners of the remaining seats in the district the new electoral districts would be formed by combining several of the current electoral districts for example richmond and delta s five current electoral districts might be combined into one electoral district which would produce five winners but not necessarily from the same party an electoral district of that size might have between 10 and 25 candidates whose names will be grouped by political party on the ballot paper electoral districts under the current fptp system british columbians elect members from 79 one member districts elections bc uses census data to maintain a uniform population level across districts so that voters have equal weight currently districts have a mean population of 50 000 however due to migration between census consideration of population densities and other factors there can be great discrepancies between electoral districts vancouver burrard has the largest population at about 67 000 people and north coast has the least population at about 27 000 people one of the criticisms of this method of is that in many populous communities in order to create districts with a population of approximately 50 000 it may be necessary to draw arbitrary boundaries which do not necessarily reflect a community of interest an electoral boundaries commission would be charged with drawing up new electoral districts much larger districts will be created that will elect multiple members proponents argue that this would create districts with a stronger sense of community and common interest for example all the electoral districts within the municipality of vancouver could be combined to form one electoral district with its borders running along the municipal borders all the electoral districts within the richmond and delta could be combined to form one electoral district the general ratio of one mla per 50 000 residents would be used to determine the number of mlas elected by a district foreign comparisons the proposed bc stv system was chosen by the members of the citizens assembly to best suit b c however it has specific similarities to and distinctions from stv electoral systems currently being used in other countries unlike the australian electoral system voters will not be required to rank every candidate if votes are transferred because a candidate has exceeded the quota required to win all of that candidate s ballots are examined for transfer votes senatorial rules unlike the method used for the irish dáil in which after a candidate has reached the quota only remaining ballots are examined for further preferences the hare method in the case of a vacancy a by election is held using the bc stv system in a riding with a single vacancy this is equivalent to the alternative vote system this is similar to the irish system but differs from the system used in australia and malta where the original ballots are recounted with the departing members votes transferred to their next preferences see also single transferrable vote fair vote canada external links bc referendum office citizens assembly on

 id=88611 title table mountain nonfiltered 935 processed 923 dbindex 1480941 table mountain is a flat topped mountain forming a prominent landmark overlooking the city of cape town in south africa it is a significant tourist attraction with many visitors using the cableway to take a ride to the top the mountain forms part of the table mountain national park features the main feature of table mountain is a level plateau approximately 3 km from side to side surrounded by steep cliffs the plateau flanked by devil s peak to the east and by lion s head to the west forms a dramatic backdrop to cape town and its table bay harbour and together with signal hill form the natural amphitheatre of the city bowl the highest point on table mountain is towards the eastern end of the plateau and is marked by maclear s beacon a stone cairn built in 1865 by sir thomas maclear for trigonometrical survey it is 1 086 m 3 563 ft above sea level about 19 m higher than the cable station at the western end of the plateau the cliffs of the main plateau are split by platteklip gorge flat stone gorge which provides an easy and direct ascent to the summit and was the route taken by antonio de saldanha on the first recorded ascent of the mountain in 1503 the flat top of the mountain is often covered by cloud spilling over the top to form the table cloth table mountain is at the northern end of a sandstone mountain range that forms the spine of the cape peninsula to the south of the main plateau is a lower part of the range called the back table on the atlantic coast of the peninsula the range is known as the twelve apostles the range continues southwards to cape point geology the upper part of the mountain mesa consists of ordovician quartzitic sandstone commonly referred to as table mountain sandstone tms which is highly resistant to erosion and forms characteristic steep grey crags below the sandstone is a layer of micaceous basal shale which weathers quite readily and is therefore not readily visible the basement consists of heavily folded and altered late precambrian malmesbury shale which has been intruded by cape granite the basement rocks are not nearly as resistant to weathering as the tms but significant outcrops of the cape granite are visible on the western side of lion s head flora the main vegetation of the mountain is the unique and rich cape fynbos an estimated 1 470 species of plants are found on the mountain and amongst them are many kinds of proteas remnant patches of indigenous forest persist in a few of the wetter ravines but not on the more exposed face above the city where conditions there are too dry and harsh for forests the mountain has also suffered serious invasions of alien plants for well over a century with perhaps the worst invader being the cluster pine considerable efforts have been made to eliminate these alien plants fauna the most common animal on the mountain is the dassie or rock hyrax they especially cluster around the upper cable station near the sources of junk food there are also porcupines mongooses snakes and tortoises the last lion in the area was shot circa 1802 leopards persisted on the mountain until perhaps the 1920 s but are now extinct locally two smaller secretive nocturnal carnivores the rooikat caracal and the vaalboskat also called the vaalkat or african wild cat were once common on the mountain the rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain himalayan tahrs fugitive descendants of tahrs that escaped from groote schuur zoo in 1936 used to be common on the less accessible upper parts of the mountain as an exotic species they were eradicated through a culling programme initiated by the south african national parks to make way for the reintroduction of indigenous klipspringers until recently there were also small numbers of fallow deer of european origin and sambar deer from southeast asia these were mainly in the rhodes memorial area but during the 1960 s they could be found as far afield as signal hill the animals may by now have been eliminated or relocated history between 1896 and 1907 five dams the woodhead hely hutchinson de villiers alexandria and victoria reservoirs were opened on the back table to supply cape town s water needs a ropeway ascending from camps bay via kasteelspoort ravine was used to ferry materials and manpower the anchor points at the old top station can still be seen there is a well preserved steam locomotive from this period housed in the waterworks museum at the top of the mountain near the hely hutchinson dam it had been used to haul materials for the dam across the flat top of the mountain cape town s water requirements have since far outpaced the capacity of the dams and they are no longer an important part of the water supply the mountain became part of the new cape peninsula national park in the 1990s the park was renamed to the table mountain national park in 1998 in 2006 a devastating fire ran through the mountain destroying large amounts of vegetation and resulting in the death of a tourist a charge of arson and culpable homicide was laid against a british man who was suspected of starting the blaze cableway the table mountain cableway takes passengers from the lower cable station on tafelberg road about 302 m above sea level to the plateau at the top of the mountain the upper cable station offers views overlooking cape town table bay and robben island to the north and the atlantic seaboard to the west and south construction of the cableway was first started in 1926 and the cableway was officially opened in 1929 in 1997 the cableway was extensively upgraded and new cars were introduced carrying 65 instead of 25 passengers the new cars give a faster journey to the summit and rotate through 360 degrees during the ascent or descent giving a panoramic view over the city the top cable station offers viewpoints curio shops a restaurant and walking trails of various lengths activities hiking hiking on table mountain is popular amongst locals and tourists and a number of trails of varying difficulty are available because of the steep cliffs around the summit direct ascents from the city side are limited platteklip gorge a prominent gorge up the centre of the main table is a popular and straightforward direct ascent to the summit longer routes to the summit go via the back table a lower area of table mountain to the south of the main plateau from the southern suburbs side the nursery ravine and skeleton gorge routes start at kirstenbosch the route via skeleton gorge to maclears beacon is known as smuts track in memory of jan smuts who was a keen hiker the bridle path or jeep track makes a more gradual ascent from constantia nek along the road used to service the dams on back table there are many other paths in popular walking ares on the lower slopes of the mountain accessed from constantia nek cecilia forest kirstenbosch newlands forest and rhodes memorial on the atlantic side the most popular ascent is kasteelspoort a gorge overlooking camps bay while the pipe track is a level route popular with walkers the hoerikwaggo trails are four hiking trails on table mountain ranging from two to six days operated by south african national parks rock climbing rock climbing on table mountain is a very popular pastime there are well documented climbing routes of varying degrees of difficulty up the many faces of the mountain only traditional climbing is allowed on table mountain no bolting can be done commercial groups offer abseiling from the upper cable station caving most of the world s important caves occur in limestone but table mountain is unusual amongst speleologists for having several large sandstone cave systems the biggest systems are the wynberg caves located on the back table not far from the jeep track in ridges overlook orange kloof and hout

 id=8444301 title algorithmics of sudoku nonfiltered 947 processed 935 dbindex 1480954 the class of sudoku puzzles consists of a partially completed row column grid of cells partitioned into n regions or zones each of size n cells to be filled in using a prescribed set of n distinct symbols typically the numbers so that each row column and region contains exactly one of each element of the set the puzzle can be solved using a variety of algorithms this page provides algorithms and implementations when appropriate solving sudokus by backtracking the basic backtracking algorithm can be adapted to solve jigsaw sudokus this is straightforward say a zone is a subset of n boxes of an n x n grid which must contain the numbers from 1 to n a standard sudoku contains 27 zones namely 9 rows 9 columns and 9 squares that are 3 x 3 in a jigsaw sudoku the square zones are replaced by zones having irregular boundaries like a jigsaw piece one possible algorithm that uses backtracking to solve such sudokus constructs a graph on vertices one vertex for each box of the grid two vertices are connected by an edge if there exists a zone containing the two boxes the problem is then equivalent to coloring this graph with n colors where adjacent vertices may not have the same color this is done by starting with an empty assignment of colors for jigsaw sudokus and assigning colors to vertices one after another using some fixed order of the vertices whenever a color is being assigned we check whether it is compatible with the existing assignments i e whether the new color occurs among the neighbors of that vertex if it doesn t then we may assign it to the vertex and try to process another vertex we backtrack once all n colors have been tried for a given vertex if all vertices have been assigned a color then we have found a solution there are of course much more sophisticated algorithms to solve graph coloring if the sudoku contains initial data i e some boxes have already been filled then these go into the color assignment before backtracking begins and the vertex sequence includes only the empty boxes a perl implementation in just 86 lines of the above algorithm which is easily translated into other programming languages is shown below it solves a 10x10 jigsaw sudoku that was proposed on les mathematiques net a link to the proposal may be found in the section for external links the first section of the program defines the 10 jigsaw pieces zones the second the row and column zones thereafter the graph is constructed as an adjacency list the search procedure prints completed solutions when all 100 boxes have been assigned otherwise it computes the set of colors present among the neighbors of the next vertex to be processed and recursively tries those assignments that do not conflict with this set the search starts with an empty assignment usr bin perl w 1 my zones qw 00 10 11 12 20 21 22 30 31 40 02 03 04 13 23 33 34 43 44 06 14 15 16 24 25 26 35

conceptually there is one modification only the backtracking algorithm sorts the vertices by the number of colors already assigned among its neighbors before selecting the next vertex to try the vertex with the largest number of assigned colors and hence the smallest number of choices is tried first there may be more than one such vertex the data structures used during the backtracking search are chosen to make this easy and fast although further optimization is possible the search state is stored in three data structures a hash table whose keys are the vertices and whose values are the colors that have been assigned to them there is an array that contains the vertices that have not yet been assigned a color finally there is a hash table whose keys are again the vertices and whose values are hash tables containing the colors present among the neighbors of the respective vertex as well as a hint as to who assigned them discussion of the reference implementation the implementation follows this sequence of steps read the dimensions of the sudoku from the command line and verify that provide a routine to map numbers to single character codes digits and uppercase letters create the row and column zones then create the subsquare zones construct the adjacency matrix of the graph the search routine print the solution if there are no more vertices to be assigned a color and return sort the remaining vertices in descending order of colors present among their neighbors pick the a vertex with the largest number of assigned colors try each of the remaining possible colors recursively update the hash table of vertex neighboring colors to reflect the assignment update the partial solution to reflect the assignment recurse remove the color from the partial solution undo the color assignments from the neighboring colors hash table before the search begins read the initial color assignment from standard input may be empty skipping comments and empty lines assignments are separated by spaces valid assignments are single character digit or letter codes compute the set of vertices to be assigned a color i e not present in the initial assignment compute

 id=361904 title flash suppressor nonfiltered 951 processed 938 dbindex 1480958 a flash suppressor also known as a flash hider flash guard flash eliminator or flash cone is a device attached to a rifle or other gun that directs hot escaping gases from the barrel end it reduces the visibility of the brilliant muzzle flash which occurs upon firing to the shooter and or other individuals muzzle flash is especially visible at night making it easy to see the location of the shooter and at the same time interfering with the shooter s night vision it is caused by incandescence of the expanding gases produced by burning gunpowder even during the day the flash obscures the target view the birdcage hider on the m16 rifle for example directs the hot gases so they do not go directly up two common types of flash suppressors are the duckbill and birdcage suppressors duckbill flash suppressors have upper and lower prongs and directs gas to the sides early mk 43 and some early m16 models featured this type one disadvantage is that the prongs can get caught on things birdcage types still have prongs but also feature a ring on the front to prevent obstructions from getting caught between the prongs another type of flash suppressor is a flash moderator such as use on some xm177 models an example of a cone shaped hider is on the bren machine gun earlier rifle designs from the 19th century tended to have longer barrels than modern rifles a side effect of the long barrel is that the gunpowder is completely burnt before the bullet leaves the barrel usually resulting only in a puff of smoke however if the same weapon is cut down as is common in cavalry and jungle combat versions the bullet would often leave the barrel before the powder was completely burnt in this case the unburnt powder would continue to burn in the air giving off a bright flash when barrel lengths dramatically decreased with the introduction of various assault rifles this flash became a serious problem originally limited to special purpose roles it was now expected that all infantry weapons would have short barrels with this problem and thereby be of limited use in night combat flash suppressors became common on late world war ii and later assault rifle designs and are almost universal on these weapons today it is commonly thought that they are used on military rifles to reduce visibility to the enemy but the size of a device necessary to completely hide the muzzle flash from an enemy during the night would be prohibitive military flash suppressors are designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the shooter to preserve their night vision usually by directing the incandescent gases to the sides away from the line of sight of the shooter military forces engaging in night combat are still quite visible and must move quickly after firing to avoid return fire limiting the amount of powder to what the barrel can burn is one possible solution but differences between individual cartridges mean that some will always have too much and the reduced powder load produces a lower projectile velocity muzzle flash can also be controlled by using cartridges with a faster burning gunpowder so that the propellant gases will already have begun to cool by the time they exit the barrel faster burning powder however produce less projectile velocity which reduces both the accuracy and lethality of the weapon flash suppressors reduce or in some cases eliminate the flash by rapidly expanding and cooling the gases as they leave the end of the barrel although the overall amount of burning gunpowder is unchanged the density and temperature are greatly reduced as is the brightness of the flash a number of different flash hider designs have been used the simplest is a cone on the end of the barrel which was used on the late world war ii jungle combat versions of the lee enfield the no 5 variant intended for use in the pacific more modern solutions tend to use a basket with several slits or holes cut in it as seen on the m16 and other small bore weapons cone shaped flash eliminators are also evident on the bren lmg and on the turret mounted aircraft machine guns of british wwii heavy bombers which were used mostly at night flash hiders are often used as a muzzle brake as well by symmetrically cutting slits near the top but not the bottom of the hider which then provides some down force on firing as the gases escape upwards thereby reducing muzzle climb as well as dust kick up legality united states flash suppressors and barrel shrouds were seen as military features and were on the list of federally defined features that provided enough features were also present on the semi automatic rifle then the rifle was defined as illegal if manufactured after the effective date of the federal assault weapons ban that went into effect in 1994 in the united states muzzle brakes on the other hand were ruled legal by the batf this meant in practice muzzle brakes had to be certified by the batf to prevent end users from accidentally violating the law and installing a device that could later be found to be defined legally as being more of a flash suppressor than a muzzle brake even if marketed and sold as a muzzle brake if incidental flash suppression was deemed to be significant by the batf the federal laws governing this sunsetted in 2004 and are no longer of concern except in those few jurisdictions in which specific state laws still retain certain provisions of the earlier and now defunct federal law see also suppressor endofarticle

 id=15227 title inuit language nonfiltered 952 processed 939 dbindex 1480959 the inuit language is traditionally spoken across the north american arctic and to some extent in the subarctic in labrador it was also to some degree spoken in far eastern russia particularly the diomede islands but is almost certainly extinct in russia today the inuit live primarily in three countries greenland an autonomous province of denmark canada and the u s state of alaska the total population of inuit speaking their traditional language is difficult to assess with precision since most counts rely on self reported census data that may not accurately reflect usage or competence greenland census estimates place the number of speakers of inuit dialects there at roughly 50 000 while canadian estimates are at roughly 30 000 these two countries count the bulk of speakers of inuit language variants as usage in alaska is increasingly moribund roughly 3 000 alaskans speak inuit dialects out of a population of over 13 000 inuit and the language is almost certainly extinct in russia in addition an estimated 7 000 greenlandic inuit live in european denmark but this is the largest group outside of canada and greenland so the global population of speakers of inuit language variants is on the order of 90 000 people what is the inuit language called the traditional language of the inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible from one end of the inuit world to the other and some people do not think of it as a single language but rather as a group of languages however there are no clear criteria for breaking the inuit language into specific member tongues since it forms a continuum of close dialects each band of inuit understands its neighbours and most likely their neighbours neighbours but at some remove comprehensibility drops to a very low level as a result inuit in different places use different words for their own variants and for the entire group of languages and this ambiguity has been carried into other languages creating a great deal of confusion over what labels should be applied to it in greenland the official form of inuit language and one of the official languages of the state is called kalaallisut in other languages it is often called greenlandic or some cognate term however neither the words kalaallisut nor greenlandic are generally used to refer to the variants of canada or alaska in alaska the language is called inupiatun but the variants of the seward peninsula are distinguished from the other alaskan variants by calling them qawiaraq or for some dialects bering straits inupiatun in canada the word inuktitut is routinely used to refer to all canadian variants of the inuit traditional language and it is under that name that it is recognised as one of the official languages of nunavut and the northwest territories however one of the variants of western nunavut is called inuinnaqtun to distinguish itself from the dialects of eastern canada while the variants of the northwest territories are sometimes called inuvialuktun and have in the past sometimes been called inuktun in those dialects the name is sometimes rendered as inuktitun to reflect dialectical differences in pronunciation the inuit language of quebec is called inuttitut by its speakers and often by other people but this is a minor variation in pronunciation in labrador the language is called inuttut or often in official documents by the more descriptive name labradorimiutut furthermore canadians both inuit and non inuit sometimes use the word inuktitut to refer to all of the inuit language variants including those of alaska and greenland the phrase inuit language is largely limited to professional discourse since in each area there is one or more conventional terms that cover all the local variants or it is used as a descriptive term in publications where readers can t necessarily be expected to know the locally used words but this means that while you can call the french language french you cannot call the inuit language inuit saying peter speaks inuit is a very strange usage that most people who are familiar with the inuit language would recognise as suspect comparable to asserting that hispanics must speak hispanic the word inuit is generally reserved for the ethnic group both from its inuit language meaning it refers specifically to a group of people and in the way the word has been adopted in english although many people refer to the inuit language as eskimo language this is an ambiguous term that can also include yupik see eskimo aleut languages and is in addition strongly discouraged in canada and diminishing in usage elsewhere see the article on eskimo for more information on this word classification and history the language of the inuit is an eskimo aleut language it is fairly closely related to the yupik languages and more remotely to the aleut languages these cousin languages are all spoken in western alaska and eastern chukotka russia it is not discernibly related to other north american or northwest asian indigenous languages although some have proposed that it is related to indo european languages as part of the hypothetical nostratic superphylum and there are those who consider it a paleo siberian language although that is more a geographic than a linguistic grouping early forms of the inuit language were spoken by the thule people who overran the dorset civilisation which had previously occupied arctic america at the beginning of the second millennium by 1300 the inuit and their language had reached western greenland and finally east greenland roughly at the same time the viking colony in southern greenland disappeared it is generally believed that it was during this centuries long eastwards migration that the inuit language became distinct from the yupik languages spoken in western alaska and chukotka until 1902 an enclave of dorset people or sadlermiut in modern inuktitut spelling sallirmiut existed on southampton island almost nothing is known about their language but the few eyewitness accounts tell of them speaking a strange dialect this suggests that they also spoke an eskimo aleut language but one quite distinct from the forms spoken in canada today the yupik and inuit languages are very similar syntactically and morphologically their common origin can be seen in a number of cognates the western alaskan variants retain a large number of features present in proto inuit language and in yup ik enough so that they might be classed as yup ik languages if they were viewed in isolation from the larger inuit world geographic distribution and variants the inuit language is a fairly closely linked set of dialects which can be broken up using a number of different criteria traditionally inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language the dialect of iglulik versus the dialect of iqaluit for example however political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the inuit language because of their links to different writing systems literary traditions schools media sources and borrowed vocabulary this makes any partition of the inuit language somewhat problematic this article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the inuit dialect spectrum this scheme is not the only one used or necessarily one used by inuit themselves but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature in addition to the territories listed below some 7 000 greenlandic speakers are reported to live in mainland denmark and according to the 2001 census roughly 200 self reported inuktitut native speakers regularly live in parts of canada which are outside of traditional inuit lands alaska see inupiatun and qawiaraq for more information of the roughly 13 000 alaskan inupiat as few as 3 000 may still be able to speak inuit language variants with most of them over the age of 40 alaskan inuit speak at least two fairly distinct dialects qawiaraq is spoken on the southern side of the seward peninsula and the norton sound area it was also in the past spoken in chukotka particularly big diomede island but appears to have vanished in russian areas through assimilation into yupik chukchi and russian speaking communities it is radically different in phonology from other inuit language variants some people consider the bering strait dialect to be separate from qawariaq inupiatun is spoken on the north slope and in the kotzebue sound area the variants of the kotzebue sound area and the northwest of alaska are sometimes called malimiutun or malimiut inupiatun however despite significant differences in phonology malimiutun is readily comprehensible to other alaskan inupiat canada see inuktitut for more information the inuit language is an official language in the northwest territories the official and dominant language of nunavut enjoys a high level of official support in nunavik a semi autonomus portion of quebec and is still spoken in some parts of labrador generally canadians refer to all dialects spoken in canada as inuktitut but the terms inuvialuktun inuinnaqtun nunatsiavummiutut sometimes called inuttut or labradorimiutut have some currency in referring to the variants of specific areas greenland see kalaallisut for more information greenland counts approximately 50 000 speakers of inuit language variants of whom over 90 speak west greenlandic dialects at home kalaallisut or in english greenlandic is the name given to the standard dialect and official language of greenland this standard national language is now taught to all greenlanders in school regardless of their native dialect it reflects almost exclusively the language of western greenland and has borrowed a great deal of vocabulary from danish while canadian and alaskan inuit language variants have tended to take vocabulary from english or sometimes french and russian it is written using the roman alphabet the dialect of the upernavik area in northwest greenland is somewhat different in phonology from the standard dialect tunumiit oraasiat or tunumiusut in kalaallisut often east greenlandic in other languages is the dialect of eastern greenland it differs sharply from other inuit language variants and has roughly 3 000 speakers according to ethnologue inuktun or avanersuartut in kalaallisut is the dialect of the area around qaanaaq in northern greenland it is sometimes called the thule dialect or north greenlandic this area is the northernmost settlement area of the inuit and has a relatively small number of speakers it is reputed to be fairly close to the north baffin dialect since a group of migratory inuit from baffin island settled in the area during the 19th and early 20th centuries it counts under 1 000 speakers according to ethnologue phonology and phonetics see main article inuit language phonology and phonetics eastern canadian inuit language variants have fifteen consonants and three vowels which can be long or short consonants are arranged with five places of articulation bilabial alveolar palatal velar and uvular and three manners of articulation voiceless stops voiced continuants and nasals as well as two additional sounds voiceless fricatives the alaskan dialects have an additional manner of articulation the retroflex which was present in proto inuit language retroflexes have disappeared in all the canadian and greenlandic dialects in natsilingmiutut the voiced palatal plosive derives from a former retroflex almost all inuit language variants have only three basic vowels and make a phonological distinction between short and long forms of all vowels the only exceptions are at the extreme edges of the inuit world parts of greenland and in western alaska morphology and syntax see inuit language morphology and syntax for a more detailed description specific to nunavut inuktitut the inuit language like other eskimo aleut languages has a very rich morphological system in which a succession of different morphemes are added to root words like verb endings in foreign european languages to indicate things that in languages like english would require several words to express see also agglutinative language and polysynthetic language all inuit language words begin with a root morpheme to which other morphemes are suffixed the language has hundreds of distinct suffixes in some dialects as many as 700 fortunately for learners the language has a highly regular morphology although the rules are sometimes very complicated they do not have exceptions in the sense that english and other indo european languages do this system makes words very long and potentially unique for example in central nunavut inuktitut tusaatsiarunnanngittualuujunga i can t hear very well this long word is composed of a root word tusaa to hear followed by five suffixes tsiaq well junnaq be able to nngit not tualuu very much junga1st pers singular present indicative non specific this sort of word construction is pervasive in inuit language and makes it very unlike english in one large canadian corpus the nunavut hansard 92 of all words appear only once in contrast to a small percentage in most english corpora of similar size this makes the application of zipf s law quite difficult in the inuit language furthermore the notion of a part of speech can be somewhat complicated in the inuit language fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns the word ilisaijuq can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb he studies but can also be interpreted as a noun student that said the meaning is probably obvious to a fluent speaker when put in context the morphology and syntax of the inuit language vary to some degree between dialects and the article inuit language morphology and syntax describes primarily central nunavut dialects but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to yupik as well vocabulary toponymy and names exotic as traditional inuit names sound both the names of places and people tend to be highly prosaic when translated iqaluit for example is simply the plural of the noun iqaluk trout iglulik simply means place with houses a word that could be interpreted as simply town inuvik is place of people baffin island qikiqtaaluk in inuit language approximately translates to big island although practically all inuit have legal names based on southern naming traditions at home and among themselves they still use native naming traditions there too names tend to consist of highly prosaic words the inuit traditionally believed that by adopting the name of a dead person or a class of things they could take some of their characteristics or powers and enjoy a part of their identity this is why they were always very willing to accept european names they believed that this made them equal to the europeans common native names in canada include ujarak rock nuvuk headland nasak hat or hood tupiq or tupeq in kalaallisut tent and qajaq kayak inuit also use animal names traditionally believing that by using those names they took on some of the characteristics of that animal nanuq or nanoq in kalaallisut polar bear uqalik or ukaleq in kalaallisut arctic hare and tiriaq or teriaq in kalaallisut ermine are favourites in other cases inuit are named after dead people or people in traditional tales by naming them after anatomical traits those people are believed to have had examples include itigaituk has no feet usuiituk has no penis and tulimak rib inuit may have any number of names given by parents and other community members words for snow see a more thorough discussion at eskimo words for snow a popular belief exists that the inuit have an unusually large number of words for snow this is not accurate and results from a misunderstanding of the nature of polysynthetic languages in fact the inuit have only a few base roots for snow qanniq qanik in some dialects which is used most often like the verb to snow and aput which means snow as a substance parts of speech work very differently in the inuit language than in english so these definitions are somewhat misleading the inuit language can form very long words by adding more and more descriptive affixes to words those affixes may modify the syntactic and semantic properties of the base word or may add qualifiers to it in much the same way that english uses adjectives or prepositional phrases to qualify nouns eg falling snow blowing snow snow on the ground snow drift etc the fact that there are many inuit words for snow has been put forward so often it is somewhat of a journalistic cliché as evidenced by a collection of quotes from linguist mark liberman writing because the inuit language is spread over such a large area divided between different nations and political units and originally reached by europeans of different origins at different times there is no uniform way of writing the inuit language most inuktitut in nunavut and nunavik is written using a scheme called inuktitut syllabics based on canadian aboriginal syllabics the western part of nunavut and the northwest territories use a roman alphabet scheme usually identified as inuinnaqtun in alaska another roman scheme is used nunatsiavut uses another variant devised by german speaking moravian missionaries which included the letter kra greenland s roman scheme was originally much like the one used in nunatsiavut but has been reformed and modified in recent years the canadian syllabary see inuktitut syllabics for more information the inuktitut syllabary used in canada is based on the cree syllabary devised by the missionary james evans the present form of the syllabary for canadian inuktitut was adopted by the inuit cultural institute in canada in the 1970s the inuit in alaska the inuvialuit inuinnaqtun speakers and inuit in greenland and labrador use the roman alphabet although it has been adapted for their use in different ways though conventionally called a syllabary the writing system has been classified by some observers as an abugida since syllables starting with the same consonant have related glyphs rather than unrelated ones all of the characters needed for the inuktitut syllabary are available in the unicode character repertoire see unified canadian aboriginal

 id=1057235 title early history of switzerland nonfiltered 955 processed 941 dbindex 1480962 the early history of switzerland begins with the earliest settlements up to the beginning of habsburg rule which in 1291 gave rise to the independence movement in the central cantons of uri schwyz and unterwalden prehistory archeological evidence from the wildkirchli cave in appenzell suggests that hunter gatherers settled in the lowlands north of the alps by the late paleolithic in the neolithic period the area was relatively densely populated as is attested to by the many archeological findings from that period remains of pile dwellings have been found in the shallow areas of many lakes in neolithic europe the swiss plateau was dominated by the linear pottery culture from the 5th millennium bc it lay on the south western outskirts of the corded ware horizon in the 3rd millennium bc evolving into the early bronze age beaker culture the first indo european settlement likely dates to the 2nd millennium at the latest in the form of the urnfield culture from c 1300 bc the swiss plateau lay in the western part of the pre or proto celtic halstatt culture evolving into the celtic la tène culture from the 5th century bc in the 1st century bc late la tène the swiss plateau was occupied by the helvetii in the west and by the vindelici in the east while the alpine parts of eastern switzerland were inhabited by the raetians roman era in 58 bce the helvetii tried to evade migratory pressure from germanic tribes by moving into gaul but were stopped and defeated at bibracte near modern day autun by julius caesar s armies and then sent back in 15 bce tiberius and drusus conquered the alps and the region became integrated into the roman empire the helvetii settlement area became part first of gallia belgica and later of the province of germania superior while the eastern part was integrated into the roman province of raetia the following 300 years saw extensive roman settlement including the construction of a road network and the founding of many settlements and cities the center of roman occupation was at aventicum avenches other cities were founded at arbor felix arbon augusta raurica kaiseraugst near basel basilea basel curia chur genava genève lousanna lausanne octodurum martigny controlling the pass of the great st bernard salodurum solothurn turicum zürich and other places military garrisons existed at tenedo zurzach and vindonissa windisch the romans also developed the great st bernard pass beginning in the year 47 and in 69 part of the legions of vitellius used it to traverse the alps it is doubtful whether hannibal in the second punic war some 300 years earlier had crossed the alps over the great st bernhard historians believe today that he had traveled over a lower and more southerly pass in the alps between lake geneva and the mediterranean sea in 259 alamanni tribes overran the limes and caused widespread devastation of roman cities and settlements the roman empire managed to reestablish the rhine as the border and the cities on swiss territory were rebuilt however it was now a frontier province and consequently the new roman cities were smaller and much more fortified christianization and post roman era in the late roman period in the 3rd and 4th centuries the christianization of the region began legends of christian martyrs such as felix and regula in zürich probably are based on events that occurred during the persecution of christians under diocletian around 298 the first bishoprics were founded in the 4th and 5th century in basel documented in 346 martigny doc 381 moved to sion in 585 geneva doc 441 and chur doc 451 there is evidence from the 6th century for a bishopric in lausanne which maybe had been moved from avenches with the fall of the western roman empire germanic tribes moved in burgundians settled in the jura the rhône valley and the alps south of lake geneva while in the north alamannic settlers crossed the rhine in 406 and slowly assimilated the gallo roman population or made it retreat into the mountains burgundy became a part of the frankish kingdom in 534 two years later the dukedom of alemannia followed suit the burgundy kings furthered the christianization through newly founded monasteries e g at romanmôtier or st maurice in the valais in 515 in the alaman part only isolated christian communities continued to exist the germanic faith including the worship of wuodan was prevalent the irish monks columbanus and gallus re introduced christian faith in the early 7th century the bishopric of konstanz also was founded at that time middle ages under the carolingian kings the feudal system proliferated and monasteries and bishopries were important bases for maintaining the rule the treaty of verdun of 843 assigned the western part of modern switzerland upper burgundy to lotharingia ruled by lothair i and the eastern part alemannia to the eastern kingdom of louis the german that would become the holy roman empire the boundary between alamania ruled by louis and western burgundy ruled by lothar ran along the lower aare turning towards the south at the rhine passing west of lucerne and across the alps along the upper rhône to saint gotthard pass louis the german in 853 assigned a monastery in zürich as the fraumünster to his daughter hildegard according to legend this occurred after a stag bearing an illuminated crucifix between his antlers appeared to him in the marshland outside the town at the shore of lake zürich however there is evidence that the monastery was already in existence before 853 the fraumünster is across the river from the grossmünster which according to legend was founded by charlemagne himself as his horse fell to his knees on the spot where the martyrs felix and regula were buried in the 10th century the rule of the carolingians waned magyars destroyed basel in 917 and st gallen in 926 and saracenes ravaged the valais after 920 and sacked the monastery of st maurice in 939 only after the victory of king otto i over the magyars in 955 in the battle of lechfeld the swiss territories were reintegrated into the empire king rudolph iii of upper burgundy r 993 1032 gave the valais as his fiefdom to the bishop of sion in 999 and when burgundy and thus also the valais became part of the holy roman empire in 1032 the bishop was also appointed count of the valais but was dominated by the 12th century by the duchy of savoy also in the 12th century the dukes of zähringen were given authority over part of the burgundy territories covering the western part of modern switzerland they founded many cities the most important being freiburg in 1120 fribourg in 1157 and berne in 1191 the zähringer dynasty ended with the death of berchtold v in 1218 and their cities subsequently thus became independent while the dukes of kyburg competed with the house of habsburg over control of the rural regions of the former zähringer territory under the hohenstaufen rule the alpine passes in raetia and the st gotthard pass gained importance especially the latter became an important direct route through the mountains the construction of the devil s bridge across the in 1198 led to a marked increase in traffic on the mule treck over the pass frederick ii accorded the reichsfreiheit to schwyz in 1240 in the freibrief von faenza in an attempt to place the important pass under his direct control and his son and for some time co regent henry vii had already given the same privileges to the valley of uri in 1231 the unterwalden was realm free since most of its territory belonged to monasteries which had become independent even earlier in 1173 under frederick i barbarossa and in 1213 under frederick ii the city of zürich also became a realm free liberty in 1218 the rise of the habsburg dynasty gained momentum when their main local competitor the kyburg dynasty died out and they could thus bring much of the territory south of the rhine under their control subsequently they managed within only a few generations to extend their influence through swabia in south eastern germany to austria rudolph i of habsburg who became emperor of the holy roman empire in 1273 instituted a strict rule in his homelands and raised the taxes tremenduously to finance wars and further territorial acquisitions as king he finally had also become the direct liege lord of the forest communities waldstätten i e uri schwyz and unterwalden which thus saw their previous independence curtailed in the valais increasing tensions between the bishops of sion and the counts of savoy led to a war beginning in 1260 the war ended after the battle at the scheuchzermatte near leuk in 1296 where the savoy forces were crushed by the bishop s army supported by forces from berne after the peace of 1301 savoy kept only the lower part of the valais while the bishop controlled the upper valais external links overview of the

 id=157333 title uss shenandoah zr 1 nonfiltered 959 processed 945 dbindex 1480966 the uss shenandoah was the first of four united states navy rigid airships she was built from 1922 to 1923 in lakehurst new jersey and first flew in 1923 she developed the navy s experience with rigid airships even making the first crossing of the north american continent by airship she was destroyed in a crash in 1925 design and construction the shenandoah was originally designated fa 1 for fleet airship number one but this was changed to zr 1 the airship was 680 feet long and weighed 36 tons she had a range of 5 000 miles and could reach speeds of 70 miles per hour the shenandoah was assembled in lakehurst new jersey between 1922 and 1923 in the only hangar large enough for the ship to fit hangar number one built in 1921 her parts were fabricated beforehand at the naval aircraft factory in philadelphia lakehurst naval air station had already served as a base for navy blimps for some time but the shenandoah was the first rigid airship to join the navy s fleet the design was initially based on the l 49 lz 96 zeppelin bomber which was downed during world war i in the american sector of france the l 49 was a lightened height climber designed for altitude at the expense of other qualities the design was found insufficient and a number of the features of newer zeppelins were incorporated into the design as well as some structural improvements the structure was built from a new alloy of aluminum and copper known as duralumin whether the changes introduced into the original design of l 49 played a part in its later breaking up is a matter of debate the shenandoah had a significant edge in safety over airships that came before it in that it was the first rigid airship to use helium rather than hydrogen a similar precaution would have prevented the hindenburg disaster twelve years later helium supplies were relatively rare at the time though and the shenandoah used much of the world s reserves just to fill its enormous volume the uss los angeles zr 3 the next rigid airship to enter navy service was at first filled with the helium from the shenandoah until more could be procured the first frame of the shenandoah was erected by 24 june 1922 and on 20 august 1923 the completed airship was floated free of the ground she was christened on 10 october 1923 sponsored by mrs edwin denby wife of the secretary of the navy and commissioned on the same day commander frank r mccrary in command early naval service the uss shenandoah took to the sky for the first time on september 4 1923 shenandoah was designed for fleet reconnaissance work of the type carried out by german naval airships in world war i her precommissioning trials included long range flights during september and early october 1923 to test her airworthiness in rain fog and poor visibility on 27 october shenandoah celebrated navy day with a flight down the shenandoah valley and returned to lakehurst that night by way of washington and baltimore where crowds gathered to see the new airship in the beams of searchlights at this time rear admiral william moffett chief of the bureau of aeronautics and staunch advocate of the airship was discussing the possibility of using shenandoah to explore the arctic such a program he felt would produce valuable weather data as well as experience in cold weather operations with her endurance and ability to fly at low speeds the airship was thought to be well suited to such work president calvin coolidge approved moffett s proposal but on 16 january 1924 shenandoah was torn from her lakehurst mooring mast by a gale and her nose was damaged she rode out the storm and landed safely but a period of repair was needed and the arctic expedition was dropped shenadoah s repairs were completed in may and she devoted the summer of 1924 to work with her powerplant and radio equipment to prepare for her duty with the fleet on 1 august she reported for duty with the scouting fleet and took part in tactical exercises shenandoah succeeded in discovering the enemy force as planned but lost contact with it in foul weather technical difficulties and lack of support facilities in the fleet forced her to depart the operating area ahead of time to return to lakehurst although this marred the exercises as far as airship reconnaissance went it emphasized the need for advanced bases and maintenance ships if lighter than air craft were to take any part in operations of this kind flight across north america in july of 1924 the oiler patoka ao 9 put in to norfolk navy yard for extensive modifications to become the navy s first airship tender an experimental mooring mast some 125 feet above the water was constructed additional accommodations both for the crew of shenandoah and for the men who would handle and supply the airship were added facilities for the helium gasoline and other supplies necessary for shenandoah were built as well as handling and stowage facilities for three seaplanes shenandoah engaged in a short series of mooring experiments with patoka to determine the practicality of mobile fleet support of scouting airships the first successful mooring was made 8 august 1924 during october of 1924 shenandoah flew from lakehurst to california and on to washington to test newly erected mooring masts this was the first flight of a rigid airship across north america later naval career the year 1925 began with nearly six months of maintenance and ground test work shenandoah did not take to the air until 26 june when she began preparations for summer operations with the fleet during july and august she again operated with the scouting fleet successfully performing scouting problems and being towed by patoka while moored to that ship s mast wreck of the shenandoah on 2 september 1925 shenandoah departed lakehurst on a promotional flight to the midwest which would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs testing of a new mooring mast at dearborn michigan was included in the schedule while passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over ohio early in the morning of the 3rd the airship was torn apart and crashed in several pieces near caldwell shenandoah s commanding officer commander zachary lansdowne and 13 other officers and men were killed twenty nine survivors succeeded in riding three sections of the airship to earth the fatal flight had been made under protest by cmdr lansdowne a native of ohio who warned of the violent weather conditions which were prevalent in the area and common to ohio in late summer his pleas for a cancellation of the flight only led to a postponement his superiors were keen to publicize airship technology and justify the huge cost of the airship to the taxpayers so publicity rather than prudence won the day this event was the trigger for army colonel billy mitchell to heavily criticize the leadership of both the army and the navy leading directly to his court martial for insubordination and the end of his military career shenandoah elementary school and shenandoah high school in noble

nassau veterans memorial coliseum also home to the new york islanders of the national hockey league iowa barnstormers 1995 2000 they had been based in des moines iowa from 1995 to 2000 as the iowa barnstormers the team had been successful in iowa having reached the arenabowl in 1996 and 1997 but the need for a more modern venue as well as the league s desire for a larger market led to the move despite two failed past attempts in new york the new york knights 1988 and the new york cityhawks 1997 1998 both of which played at madison square garden in manhattan the team was purchased by charles wang who is also the islanders majority owner the arena football organization did award an af2 franchise to iowa for the 2001 season also called the barnstormers but that team folded after that season the barnstormers were noted for their unique uniforms which in keeping with the aviation theme included the depiction of goggles on the helmets wings on the shoulders of the jerseys and propellers on the pants legs the primary figures in the original iowa organization was jim foster the inventor of arena football and kurt warner the quarterback who won the both the nfl mvp award and the mvp for super bowl xxxiv aside from the league s desire to re enter the new york market another major reason cited for the team s relocation was the inadequacy of their des moines venue the iowa veterans memorial auditorium also known as the barn all seating in this venue was located directly along the sidelines as is typical of high school sports venues the barnstormers organization constantly lobbied for the construction of a better facility during their time in des moines to no avail in 2005 the wells fargo arena opened in des moines directly across from what the locals call vets as part of the iowa events center it was built too late to keep the barnstormers but could lure an arena football team to des moines in the future new york dragons 2001 present nassau coliseum where the franchise relocated is generally regarded as one of the most marginal venues currently used in major american professional sports and is often proposed for replacement so the improvement of the situation with regards to a venue has been fairly minimal to this point in late september of 2004 islanders ownership announced an ambitious project to renovate the coliseum surrounding it with housing units and construction of an adjacent tower resembling a lighthouse at a total cost of over 200 million us since the lighthouse has been taken out of the design plan the new york dragons currently compete in the eastern division of the national conference they are coached by former barnstormer defensive back weylan harding in the 2006 season weylan harding became the most winningest

garcia a quarterback has the honor of most touchdown passes in a game 11 and most touchdown passes in a season 104 set in 2001 through his 10 year career he has thrown over 750 touchdown passes the

13th manned american flight and the 21st spaceflight of all time includes x 15 flights over 100 km it was the last u s spacecraft to be flown using batteries as the primary power source except for the apollo lunar module which used batteries but was augmented by the fuel cells on the apollo command module while docked all remaining gemini flights used fuel cells crew wally schirra 2 command pilot

mission parameters mass 3 546 kg perigee 161 km apogee 259 4 km inclination 28 97 period 88 7 min see also splashdown agena target vehicle objectives gemini 6 was originally intended to be the first mission to dock with an agena target vehicle however after a failure in the agena target 6 minutes after its launch when the crew of gemini 6 was already sitting in their capsule waiting for their launch the mission was canceled reviewing the situation nasa decided to substitute an alternate mission a meeting in space of two gemini spacecraft the new mission would be known as gemini 6a and would launch eight days after the launch of borman and lovell s gemini vii schirra and stafford tried to join them but their titan 2 launcher shut down on the pad the cool headed schirra did not eject even though the countdown clock had started ticking he felt no motion and trusted his senses three days later gemini 6a made it into orbit using guidance from the computer as well as his own piloting schirra performed the space rendezvous with the companion spacecraft in orbit on the afternoon of december 15 once in formation the two gemini capsules flew around each other coming within 0 3 meters of each other but never touching the two spacecraft stayed in close proximity for five hours one of gemini s primary goals orbital rendezvous had been achieved flight first launch attempt the first launch attempt of gemini 6a was on december 12 all went well right up to ignition in fact the engines did ignite but then a plug fell out of the bottom of the rocket starting the onboard programmer this was not meant to happen until the rocket had actually lifted off and the onboard computer detected that there was no upwards motion causing it to abort the launch at this point mission rules dictated that the crew should eject from the spacecraft as the rocket would explode on impact with the pad if it had lifted off by even an inch schirra elected not to eject as neither he nor stafford had detected any upwards motion and the ejection seats were seen as a last resort in an early test of the system involving a dummy the hatch had failed to blow off and the dummy s head was rammed into the side of the spacecraft also all ejection seats cause compression of the spine and these were designed to send the astronauts a couple of hundred metres away from an exploding rocket the martin and air force teams who erected and tested the rocket found that some plugs on the rocket were able to pull out more easily than others they replaced them with the ones that were harder to pull out and on future missions and a safety wire was added to make sure that the rocket had lifted off however another problem was found as the engineers examined the thrust versus time graph they found that the thrust rose nominally but started to get lower before the plug had fallen out through the night engineers examined the rocket engine piece by piece until they found that a plastic cover had been left in the gas generator port with this problem solved the rocket and spacecraft were recycled for a launch 72 hours after the first attempt rendezvous the third attempt to launch gemini spacecraft number 6 was finally successful on december 15 all went well through launch and ascent and the crew entered a 161 by 259 kilometers orbit the plan called for the rendezvous to take place on the fourth orbit of gemini 6a their first burn came 94 minutes after launch when they increased their speed by 5 meters per second due to their lower orbit they were gaining on gemini 7 and were only 1 175 kilometers behind the next burn was at 2 hours and 18 minutes when gemini 6a made a phase adjustment to put them on the same orbital inclination as gemini 7 they now only trailed by 483 kilometers the radar on gemini 6a first made contact with gemini 7 at 3 hours and 15 minutes when they were 434 kilometers away a third burn put them into a 270 by 274 kilometer orbit as they slowly gained schirra put gemini 6a s computer in charge of the rendezvous at 5 hours and 4 minutes he saw a bright star that he thought was sirius but this was in fact gemini 7 after several more burns the two spacecraft were only 40 meters apart the burns had only used 51 kilograms of fuel on gemini 6a giving plenty of fuel for some fly arounds during the next 270 minutes the crews moved as close as 30 centimetres to 90 meters

the while she is contemplating the nature of death and the details of how she will take her own life she has stolen medication in the form of pills from her chronically depressed mother after deliberating over suicide notes she takes an overdose of the pills and begins to hallucinate believing that the lurid floral pattern on her bedclothes is spreading over her and strangling her at this point a new chapter starts and the backstory is told by means of flashback the events of the recent past tina and her sister jan encounter two boys from the local fee paying boys boarding school st christopher s on their way to school one day the boys wave at tina but jan warns her to take no notice of them believing that the boys from st christopher s only see girls from their comprehensive school as handkerchiefs i e to be taken advantage of and not as people of value in themselves tina meets the boys adam and simon again by chance and begins to talk to simon they bond over a conversation about pets and family which is inspired by a delivery of new puppies to the local pet shop tina reveals that she doesn t get on well with her mother simon seems to be from a different world he is upper middle class academic and a sixth former with prospects of attending cambridge university despite the differences in background the two get along well and arrange to meet again simon and tina forge a relationship they sleep together albeit outside in an enclosed section of the local cemetery which becomes their special place tina tells simon that she loves him which takes him by surprise she also confides in him the problems that she rarely discusses with anyone that her twin brother died in an accident several years earlier and her mother has never recovered almost failing to recognise tina as a person at all simon is genuinely shocked and concerned at her troubles they are far removed from his sheltered life good prospects and happy family tina is bright but she lacks ambition and finds herself unable to focus on schoolwork in the way in which teachers demand she has fallen behind simon s rather old fashioned use of language and the way in which his speech is littered with academic and literary references alienates tina and makes her self conscious we are told that although tina has had plenty of interest from boys in recent years she hasn t seen the point of relationships until meeting simon he s the only one she has felt affection for and wanted to become involved with one night tina offers to babysit for her oldest sister 18 year old louise so that simon and she can have a place to themselves for the evening they have always had to meet outside because tina can t face the prospect of taking simon to her family home she keeps him a secret from them for as long as possible simon is not allowed to take visitors into his school simon has expressed his surprise at tina s sister being married and having a child at her young age as though it wouldn t happen in his social circles tina is worried that he will find louise s decor tacky and tasteless after a few weeks the christmas holidays are approaching simon fails to invite her to an end of term dance tina only learns of this event through adam who seems to want to cause trouble between them simon tells tina that he will take one of adam s female friends caroline but that she isn t as pretty or charming or natural as tina and she is not under any threat of being replaced simon as a boarder has to travel elsewhere in the country to his home tina is devastated that he is leaving and asks him to contact her every day he gives her an expensive toy dog as a christmas present and she buys him a sweater and cross stitches its label with a loving message which takes her a long time he responds at first but then his contact tails off completely despite tina s letters she finds his family s telephone number through directory enquiries and calls discovering that simon has been away with a group of friends simon continues to ignore her when he returns to tina s town after she pursues him he does meet with her but is ungracious and lacking the gentle manner he had before he then tells her that he has met someone else and that their relationship is over the other girl is caroline the girl at the dance simon tells tina that caroline is more on his wavelength with the same interests and also with prospects of attending cambridge and that tina in comparison was good fun but not nearly as significant tina is horrified simon is unable to cope with the intensity of her feeling and the realisation of the huge impact he has made upon an already troubled girl he cries and leaves tina is unable to accept that the relationship is over and pursues simon further it transpires that simon only became involved with tina when adam made a bet that he would be able to seduce her which seems to prove jan s theory regarding their attitudes to girls in a different social class however simon then explains that he lost the bet because he did develop genuine feelings for tina and continued to see her he admits that he was surprised by her depth of character as though he had thought that local girls had no sensitivity or personality tina is inconsolable jan and louise s extensive efforts to comfort her fail tina finds herself unable to stay in school and unable to function and in desperation begins to hoard her mother s antidepressants in preperation for her suicide bid returning to the present when we arrive back in the present time tina is in hospital she is found in time and is making a slow recovery jan is furious that simon s carelessness led to her being in this state and has showed him the suicide note addressed to him but he is too distraught to visit her adam comes along instead and despite his usual show of light heartedness it is clear that he realises the seriousness of the situation tina s mother is initially very angry with her considering her to be selfish but then appears to soften and feel a sympathy tina agrees to counselling the ending of the novel is rather ambivalent tina appears to realise that she is a whole person despite losing tim and simon and she finds enough emotional energy to joke with her sisters but she is still far from being completely healed or completely over simon parallels between tina and tess simon has a habit of making literary allusions and the one that tina seizes upon is his comparison of herself with tess of the d urbervilles he is reminded of tess when tina wears a white dress and looks like an archetypal pure woman he also draws attention to red shoes that tina wears explaining that there are little touches of red throughout thomas hardy s novel it s all very symbolic he says tina is keen to hear what becomes of the woman she resembles and simon laughingly recounts tess s fate although simon is merely playing with cultural references as is no doubt encouraged within his social circle tina does indeed mirror tess simon treats tina fairly carelessly without considering how his actions will affect her in the same way that the men in tess s life fail to see tess as a whole person in her own right and largely disregard the consequences of the way they treat her until it is too late in addition tina like tess suffers more greatly because she is working class she is not seemingly expected to have as complex or intelligent a character as middle class girls and she is marginalised and exploited endofarticle doc doc

cosmological constant as well as an empty expanding cosmology with a cosmological constant termed a de sitter universe 1922 vesto slipher summarizes his findings on the spiral nebulae s systematic redshifts 1922 alexander friedmann finds a solution to the einstein field equations which suggests a general expansion of space 1927 georges lemaître discusses the creation event of an expanding universe governed by the einstein field equations 1928 howard percy robertson briefly mentions that vesto slipher s redshift measurements combined with brightness measurements of the same galaxies indicate a redshift distance relation 1929 edwin hubble demonstrates the linear redshift distance relation and thus shows the expansion of the universe 1933 edward milne names and formalizes the cosmological principle 1934 georges lemaître interprets the cosmological constant as due to a vacuum energy with an unusual perfect fluid equation of state 1938 paul dirac suggests the large numbers hypothesis that the gravitational constant may be small because it is decreasing slowly with time 1948 ralph alpher hans bethe in absentia and george gamow examine element synthesis in a rapidly expanding and cooling universe and suggest that the elements were produced by rapid neutron capture 1948 hermann bondi thomas gold and fred hoyle propose steady state cosmologies based on the perfect cosmological principle 1948 george gamow predicts the existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation by considering the behavior of primordial radiation in an expanding universe 1950 to 1999 1950 oskar klein proposes a meta galaxy model a first indication of the alfvén klein model 1950 fred hoyle derisively coins the term big bang 1951 william mccrea shows that the steady state c field can be accommodated within general relativity by interpreting it as a contribution to the energy momentum tensor with an unusual equation of state 1961 robert dicke argues that carbon based life can only arise when the gravitational force is small because this is when burning stars exist first use of the weak anthropic principle 1963 fred hoyle and jayant narlikar show that the steady state theory can explain the isotropy of the universe because deviations from isotropy and homogeneity decay exponentially in time 1964 fred hoyle and roger tayler point out that the primordial helium

neutrinos and claim that at most five lepton families can exist 1981 viacheslav mukhanov and g chibisov propose that quantum fluctuations could lead to large scale structure in an inflationary universe 1981 alan guth proposes the inflationary big bang universe as a possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems 1990 preliminary results from nasa s cobe mission confirm the cosmic microwave background radiation is an isotropic blackbody to an astonishing one part in 105 precision thus eliminating the possibility of an integrated starlight model proposed for the background by steady state enthusiasts 1990s ground based cosmic microwave background experiments measure the first peak determine that the universe is geometrically flat 1998 controversial evidence for the fine structure constant varying over the lifetime of the universe is first published 1998 adam riess saul perlmutter and others discover the cosmic acceleration in observations of type ia supernovae providing the first evidence for a non zero cosmological constant 1999 measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation most notably by the boomerang experiment see mauskopf et al 1999 melchiorri et al 1999 de bernardis et al 2000 provide evidence for oscillations peaks in the anisotropy angular spectrum as expected in the standard model of cosmological structure formation these results indicates that the geometry of the universe is flat together with large scale structure data this provides complementary evidence for a non zero cosmological constant since 2000 2003 nasa s wmap takes more detailed pictures of the cosmic microwave background radiation than were obtained by the boomerang experiment the image can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13 7 billion

of hasidic judaism then based in liadi imperial russia he was the author of many works and is best known for shulchan aruch harav tanya and his siddur compiled according to the arizal he is also known as shneur zalman baruchovitch of liadi or reb schneur zalman or baal hatanya veshulchan aruch or alter rebbe old rebbe in yiddish or the rav biography rabbi shneur zalman was born in 1745 in the small town of liozno polish lithuanian commonwealth white russia he was a descendent of the mystic and philosopher rabbi judah loew the maharal of prague he was a prominent and youngest disciple of rabbi dovber of mezeritch the great maggid who was in turn the successor of the founder of hasidism rabbi israel ben eliezer known as the baal shem tov master the good name until the age of twelve he studied under rabbi issachar ber in lyubavichi lubavitch he distinguished himself as a talmudist such that his teacher sent him back home informing his father that the boy could continue his studies without the aid of a teacher at age fifteen he married sterna segal the daughter of yehuda leib segal a wealthy resident of vitebsk and he was then able to devote himself entirely to study during these years shneur zalman was introduced to mathematics geometry and astronomy by two learned brothers refugees from bohemia who had settled in liozna one of them was also a scholar of the kabbalah thus besides mastering rabbinic literature he also acquired a fair knowledge of the sciences philosophy and kabbalah he became an adept in isaac luria s system of kabbalah and it is thought that this is when he became an admirer of rabbi dovber of mezeritch for twelve years he lived in rabbi dovber s house and took an active part in the propagation of hasidism during the latter portion of rabbi dovber s life his students dispersed over europe and after rabbi dovber s passing rabbi shneur zalman became the leader of hasidism in lithuania at the time lithuania was the center of the misnagdim opponents of hasidism and shneur zalman faced much opposition in 1772 together with menachem mendel of vitebsk he attempted to create a dialogue with the vilna gaon who led the misnagdim and had launched a ban cherem against the hasidim this unfortunately failed see vilna gaon antagonism to hasidism hasidim and mitnagdim undaunted by this antagonism he succeeded in creating a powerful network of hasidic centers he also involved himself in opposing napoleon s advance on russia by recruiting his dispiples to the czar s army and canvassing financial support for the jewish settlements in the land of israel then under the control of the ottoman empire in 1797 following the death of the gaon leaders of the vilna community falsely accused the hasidim of subversive activities on charges of supporting the ottoman empire since he advocated sending charity to the ottoman territory of palestine he was then imprisoned in st petersburg for three months he remained imprisoned in a fortress and was then subjected to an examination by a secret commission ultimately he was released by order of paul i of russia in 1798 the day of his acquittal and release 19 kislev 5559 on the hebrew calendar is celebrated as the hasidic new year by lubavitch hasidim who have a festive meal and communal pledges to learn the whole of the talmud known as chalukat ha shas two years later he was again imprisoned based on false denunciation he was released immediately after the accession of alexander i of russia and he was then given full liberty to proclaim his religious teachings by the russian government it was after this that he moved his base to liadi imperial russia rather than returning to liozna he took up his residence in the town of liadi at the invitation of prince stanis aw lubomirski voivod of the town in liadi his movement grew immensely and he is still associated with liadi to this day rabbi shneur zalman has since been accepted as one of the greatest hasidic leaders inasmuch as the books that he authored studied and respected by all hasidic groups in 1812 fleeing the french invasion he left mogilev intending to go to poltava but died on the way in the small village of pyen near kursk he was succeeded as rebbe by his oldest son dovber according to david assaf his youngest son moshe converted to catholicism however this is disputed philosophy see hasidic philosophy as a talmudist rabbi shneur zalman endeavored to place kabbalah and hasidism on a rational basis in his seminal work tanya he defines his approach as mind ruling over the heart emotions he chose the name chabad for this philosophy the hebrew acronym for the sefirot chochma wisdom bina understanding and da at knowledge both in his works and in his sermons he indicated an intelligent and not a blind faith and assumed an intellectual accessibility of the mystical teachings of the kabbalah this intellectual basis differentiates chabad from other forms of hasidism chabad refers to these as chagat being the emotional attributes sefirot of chesed kindness gevurah power and tifereth beauty subsequent history of chabad see chabad lubavitch history of the movement after he passed away his son and successor rabbi dovber schneuri moved the movement to the town of lubavitch lyubavichi in present day belarus in 1940 under the leadership of the previous rebbe rabbi joseph isaac schneersohn the chabad lubavitch movement moved its headquarters to brooklyn new york in the united states under the leadership of rabbi menachem mendel schneerson chabad established branches all over the world staffed by its own lubavitch trained and ordained rabbis with their wives and children another follower of his rabbi aharon halevi horowitz established a rival chabad school in strashelye descendants of rabbi shneur zalman adopted the names schneersohn or schneerson to accommodate napoleonic edicts that required all subjects to take permanent surnames prior to napoleon s conquests and the winds of enlightenment he brought in his wake jews only had their traditional names such as shneur ben son of boruch the last two rebbes of chabad lubavitch rabbi joseph isaac schneersohn 1880 1950 and rabbi menachem mendel schneerson 1902 1994 adhered strictly to their family surnames works rabbi shneur zalman of liadi was a prolific writer but only a few of his works have been published he produced works of both mysticism and law reflecting his intellectual stance on hasidism to this day his works form the cornerstone of chabad lubavitch his ability to explain even the most complex issues of torah made his writings popular with torah scholars everywhere he is probably best known for his systematic exposition of hasidic jewish philosophy entitled likkutei amarim and more popularly known as the tanya first published in 1797 the fuller and more authoritative version of this work dates from 1814 due to the popularity of this book hasidic jews often refer to shneur zalman as the baal hatanya the tanya deals with jewish spirituality and psychology from a kabbalistic point of view and expounds on such profound themes as the oneness of god tzimtzum the sefirot and many other mystical concepts he is equally well known for the shulchan aruch harav his version of the classic shulkhan arukh an authoritative code of jewish law and custom commissioned by rabbi dovber of mezeritch the work states the decided halakha as well as the underlying reasoning the shulchan aruch harav is considered authoritative by other hasidim and citations to this work are many times found in non hasidic sources such as the mishnah berurah used by lithuanian jews and the ben ish chai used by sephardic jews rabbi shneur zalman is one of three authorities on whom shlomo ganzfried based his kitzur

 id=1433274 title x window system protocols and architecture nonfiltered 1039 processed 1025 dbindex 1481049 in computing the x window system commonly x11 or x is a network transparent windowing system for bitmap displays this article details the protocols and technical structure of x11 the x client server model and network transparency x is based on a client server model an x server program runs on a computer with a graphical display and communicates with various client programs the server accepts requests for graphical output windows and sends back user input keyboard mouse in x window the server runs on the user s computer while the clients may run on a different machine this is the reverse of the common configuration of client server systems where the client runs on the user s computer and the server runs on a remote computer this reversal often confuses new x users the x window terminology takes the perspective of the program rather than the end user or the hardware the remote programs connect to the x server display running on the local machine and thus act as clients the local x display accepts incoming traffic and thus acts as a server the communication protocol between server and client runs network transparently the client and server may run on the same machine or on different ones possibly with different architectures and operating systems a client and server can communicate securely over the internet by tunneling the connection over an encrypted connection design principles bob scheifler and jim gettys set out the early principles of x as follows as listed in scheifler gettys 1996 do not add new functionality unless an implementor cannot complete a real application without it it is as important to decide what a system is not as to decide what it is do not serve all the world s needs rather make the system extensible so that additional needs can be met in an upwardly compatible fashion the only thing worse than generalizing from one example is generalizing from no examples at all if a problem is not completely understood it is probably best to provide no solution at all if you can get 90 percent of the desired effect for 10 percent of the work use the simpler solution see also worse is better isolate complexity as much as possible provide mechanism rather than policy in particular place user interface policy in the clients hands the first principle was modified during the design of x11 to do not add new functionality unless you know of some real application that will require it x has largely kept to these principles since the reference implementation is developed with a view to extension and improvement of the implementation whilst remaining almost entirely compatible with the original 1987 protocol x window core protocol communication between server and clients is done by exchanging packets over a network channel the connection is established by the client which sends the first packet the server answers by sending back a packet stating the acceptance or refusal of the connection or with a request for a further authentication if the connection is accepted the acceptance packet contains data for the client to use in the subsequent interaction with the server after connection is established four types of packets are exchanged by the client and the server over the channel request the client requests information from the server or requests it to perform an action reply the server responds to a request not all requests generate replies event the server sends an event to the client e g keyboard or mouse input or a window being moved resized or exposed error the server sends an error packet if a request is invalid since requests are queued error packets generated by a request may not be sent immediately the x server provides a set of basic services the client programs realize more complex functionalities by interacting with the server windows what is usually called a window in other graphical user interfaces is a top level window in the x window system the term window is also used for windows that lie within another window that is the subwindows of a parent window graphical elements such as buttons menus icons etc are all realized using windows a window can only be created as a subwindow of a parent window this makes the windows to be arranged in a tree that is a hierarchy the root of this hierarchy is called the root window which is automatically created by the server the top level windows are exactly the direct subwindows of the root window visibly the root window is as large as the screen and lies behind all other windows identifiers all data about windows fonts etc is stored in the server the client knows identifiers of these objects integers it can use as names for them when interacting with the server for example if a client wishes a window to be created it requests the server to create a window with a given identifier the server creates a window and associates it with the identifier the identifier can be later used by the client to request for example a string to be drawn in the window identifiers are unique to the server not only to the client for example no two windows have the same identifier even if created by two different clients a client can access any object given its identifier even if the object has been created by another client attributes and properties every window has a predefined set of attributes and a set of properties all stored in the server and accessible to the clients via appropriate requests attributes are data about the window such as its size position background color etc properties are pieces of data that are attached to a window contrary to attributes properties have no meaning at the level of the x window core protocol a client can store arbitrary data in a property of a window a property is characterized by a name a type and a value properties are similar to variables in imperative programming languages in that the application can create a new property with a given name and of a given type and store a value in it properties are associated to windows two properties with the same name can exist on two different windows while having different types and values properties are mostly used for inter client communication for example the property named wm_name is used for storing the name for the window window managers typically read this property and display the name of the window at the top of it the properties of a window can be shown using the xprop program in particular xprop root shows the properties of the root window which include the x resources parameters of programs events events are packets sent by the server to the client to communicate that something the client may be interested in has happened a client can request the server to send an event to another client this is used for communication between clients for example when a client requests the text that is currently selected an event is sent to the client that is currently handling the window that holds the selection the content of a window may be destroyed in some conditions for example if the window is covered whenever an area of destroyed content is made visible the server generates an expose event to notify the client that a part of the window has to be drawn other events are used to notify clients of keyboard or mouse input of the creation of new windows etc some kinds of events are always sent to client but most kinds of event are sent only if the client previously stated an interest in them this is because clients may only be interested in some kind of events for example a client may be interested in keyboard related event but not in mouse related events color modes the way colors are handled in the x window systems sometimes confuse users and historically several different modes has been supported most modern applications use truecolor 24 bit color 8 bits for each of red green and blue but old or specialist applications may require a different color mode many commercial specialist applications use pseudocolor the x11 protocol actually uses a single 32 bit unsigned integer for representing a single color in most graphic operations called a pixelvalue when transferring primary colors intensity a 16 bits integer is used for each colour component the following representations of colors exist not all of them may be supported on a specific device directcolor a pixel value is decomposed into separate red green and blue subfields each subfield indexes a separate colormap entries in all colormaps can be changed truecolor same as directcolor except that the colormap entries are predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed typically each of the red green and blue colormaps provides a near linear ramp of intensity grayscale a pixel value indexes a single colormap that contains monochrome intensities colormap entries can be changed staticgray same as grayscale except that the colormap entries are predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed pseudocolor chunky a pixel value indexes a single colormap that contains color intensities colormap entries can be changed staticcolor same as pseudocolor except that the colormap entries are predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed xlib and other client libraries most client programs communicate with the server via the xlib client library in particular most clients use libraries such as xaw motif gtk or qt which in turn use xlib for interacting with the server inter client communication the x window core protocol provides mechanisms for communication between clients window properties and events in particular the client to client message events however it does not specify any protocol for such interactions these protocols are instead governed by a separate set of inter client communication conventions the inter client communication conventions manual specifies the protocol for the exchange of data via selections and the interaction of applications with the window manager this specification has been considered difficult and confusing consistency of application look and feel and communication is typically addressed by programming to a given desktop environment the inter client exchange protocol ice specifies a framework for building protocols for interaction between clients so that a specific protocol can be built at the top of it in particular the x session management protocol xsmp is a protocol based on ice that mandates over the interaction between applications with the session manager which is the program that takes care of storing the status of the desktop at the end of an interactive session and recovering it when another session with the same user is started again newer conventions are included in the freedesktop specifications including the drag and drop convention xdnd used for transferring data by selecting it and dragging in another window and the embedded application convention xembed which details how an application can be run in a subwindow of another application selections cut buffers and drag and drop selections cut buffers and drag and drop are the mechanisms used in the x window system to allow a user to transfer data from a window to another selections and cut buffer are used typically when a user selects text or some other data in a window and paste in another one drag and drop is used when a user selects something in a window then clicks on the selection and drags it into another window since the two windows may be handled by two different applications data transfer requires two different clients connected with the same x server to interact the x window core protocol includes some types of requests and events that are specific to selection exchange but the transfer is mainly done using the general client to client event sending and window properties which are not specific to selection transfer data to be transferred between clients can be of different types it is usually text but can also be a pixmap a number a list of objects etc selections and drag and drop are active mechanisms after some text has been selected in a window the client handling the window must actively support a protocol for transferring the data to the application requesting it on the contrary cut buffers are a passive mechanism when the user selects some text its content is transferred to a cut buffer where it remains even if the application handling the window terminates and the window is destroyed window manager a window manager is a program that controls the general appearance of windows and other graphical elements of the graphical user interface differences in the look of x window system in different installations is mainly due to the use of different window managers or different configurations of the window manager the window manager takes care of deciding the position of windows placing the decorative border around them handling icons handling mouse clicks outside windows on the background handling certain keystrokes for example iconifying a window when alt f4 is pressed etc from the point of view of the x server the window manager is not different from the other clients the initial position and the decorative borders around windows are handled by the window manager using the following requests an application can request the server not to satisfy requests of mapping showing subwindows of a given window and to be sent an event instead an application can request changing the parent of a window the window manager uses the first request to intercept any request for mapping top level windows children of the root window whenever another application requests the mapping of a top level window the server does not do it but sends an event to the window manager instead most window managers reparents the window they create a larger top level window called the frame window and reparent the original window as a child of it graphically this corresponds to placing the original window inside the frame window the space of the frame window that is not taken by the original window is used for the decorative frame around the window the border and the title bar the window manager manages mouse clicks in the frame window this allows for example to move or resize the window when the user clicks and drags on the border or on the title bar the window manager is also responsible for the handling of icons and related visual elements of the graphical user interface icons do not exist at the level of the x window core protocol they are implemented by the window manager for example whenever a window has to be iconified the window manager fvwm unmaps the window making it not visible and creates a window for the icon name and possibly another window for the icon image the meaning and handling of icons is therefore completely decided by the window manager some window managers such as wm2 do not implement icons at all session manager roughly the state of a session is the state of the desktop at a given time a set of windows with their current content more precisely it is the set of applications managing these windows and the information that allow these applications to restore the condition of their managed windows if required an x session manager is a program that saves and restore the state of sessions the most recognizable effect of using a session manager is the possibility of logging out from an interactive session and then finding exactly the same windows in the same state when logging in again for this to work the session manager program stores the names of the running applications at logout and starts them again at login in order for the state of the applications to be restored as well which is needed to restore the content of windows the applications must be able to save their state of execution upon request from the session manager and load it back when they start again the x window system include a default session manager called xsm other session managers have been developed for specific desktop systems for example ksmserver is the default session manager of kde x display manager the x display manager is the program that shows the graphical login prompt in the x window system more generally a display manager runs one or more x servers on the local computer and accepts incoming connections from x servers running on remote computers the local servers are started by the display manager which then connects to them to present the user the login screen the remote servers are started independently from the display manager and connect to it in this situation the display manager works like a graphical telnet server an x server can connect to the display manager which starts a session the programs of this sessions run on the same computer of the display manager but have input and output on the computer where the x server runs which is the computer in front of the user xdm is the basic display manager supplied with the x window system other display manager include gdm gnome kdm kde wdm using the wings widget set used in window maker and entrance using the architecture used in enlightenment v 17 user interface elements early widget toolkits for x included xaw the athena widget set olit open look intrinsics toolkit

environment used on commercial unix systems such as solaris and hp ux gnome is offered in solaris 9 and will be standard in future versions more modern toolkits include qt used by kde gtk used by gnome wxwidgets fltk and fox extensions the x server was designed to be simple but extensible as such much functionality now resides in extensions to the protocol at the protocol level every extension can be assigned new request event error packet types access to client applications to the functionalities provided by extensions is facilitated by client libraries the coding of extensions into the current x server implementations is reportedly difficult due to a lack of modularity in the server design it is a long term goal of the xcb project to automate generating both the client and server

 id=191336 title virtual economy nonfiltered 1052 processed 1038 dbindex 1481062 a virtual economy or sometimes synthetic economy is an emergent economy existing in a virtual persistent world usually in the context of an internet game people enter these virtual economies recreationally rather than by necessity however some people do interact with them for real economic benefit overview these economies are observed in muds and massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs the largest virtual economies are currently found in mmorpgs such as entropia universe everquest ultima online dark age of camelot world of warcraft lineage industryplayer miniconomy runescape and eve online virtual economies also exist in life simulation games such as the sims online or second life which has perhaps taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world such as recognizing ip rights for assets created in world by second life subscribers and maintaining a laissez faire policy on the buying and selling of linden dollars the world s official currency for real money on 3rd party websites they can even exist in browser based internet games like neopets tokenzone or kingdom of loathing where real money can be spent and user created shops opened or in other games as a kind of emergent gameplay persistence the software maintains a record of the state of the world and the resource possessions of the players regardless of whether or not the game is in session for any user scarcity users must expend real resources such as time and money to obtain goods and or services in the synthetic world specialization availability to players of the resources must vary for example a participant whose character has metalsmithing skills could have the ability to make swords while other players would have to purchase them because this results in comparative advantage complex trade relationships and a division of labor result trade users must be able to transfer goods and services to and from other users property rights the world must record which goods and services belong to which user identity and the code must allow that user to dispose of the good or service according to whim these conditions of scarcity specialization and comparative advantage will create an economic system with properties similar to those seen in contemporary economies therefore economic theory can often be used to study these virtual worlds within the virtual worlds they inhabit synthetic economies allow in game items to be priced according to supply and demand rather than by the developer s estimate of the item s utility these emergent economies are considered by most players to be an asset of the game giving an extra dimension of reality to play in classical synthetic economies these goods were changed only for in game currencies these curriencies are often sold for real world profit controversy real economy interaction often within a game s synthetic economy interaction with the real economy will occur characters spells and items are sold on online auction websites like ebay for real money these real economies are controversial to say the least for example most would consider it in poor taste to offer in a social game one player real cash in order to play a certain way for example the hated one real dollar for boardwalk player they are viewed by gamers and game designers as spoilers however such rules of etiquette need not apply and in practice they often don t to massive game worlds with thousands of players who know one another only through the game system while many game developers such as blizzard responsible for world of warcraft prohibit the practice it is common that goods and services within virtual economies will be sold on online auction sites such as ebay traded for real currencies some argue that to allow in game items to have monetary values makes these games essentially gambling venues according to standard conceptions of economic value see the subjective theory of value the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money monthly fees in exchange for these resources by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user some virtual world developers officially sell virtual items and currency for real world money for example the mmog there has therebucks that sell for us dollars the currency in entropia universe project entropia dollars ped could be bought and redeemed for real world money at a rate of 10 ped for u s 1 on december 14 2004 an island in project entropia sold for u s 26 500 13 700 one gamer also purchased a virtual space station for u s 100 000 56 200 and plans to use it as a virtual nightclub one of the largest virtual economies lineage is based in south korea claiming to have four million users the location of its online market if it exists is unknown many players question the security of such a system due to the possibility of bugs some have claimed that real economic interactions within virtual economies create a game that constitutes gambling and that these games should be regulated as such others such as the themis group s richard bartle have argued that the notion of virtual property is inherently flawed since players do not own materially or intellectually any part of the game world and merely pay to use it in fact one of the dangers of investment in virtual property is that the game developer is free to change the game world at any time furthermore because virtual property is actually owned by the game developer a developer who opposed real commerce of in game currencies would have the right to destroy virtual goods as soon as they were listed on ebay or otherwise offered for real trade though this decision would be highly controversial a massive market place the release of blizzards world of warcraft in 2004 and its subsequent huge success far surpassing any other mmorpg across the globe has forced both mmorpgs and their secondary markets into mainstream consciousness many new market places have opened up during this time a quick search for wow gold on google will show a multitude of sites 90 sponsored results at this time june 2006 from which gold can be purchased a far cry from the days when players would trade amongst themselves and over ebay price comparison and other tools in such a comparatively competitive market business entrepreneurs have stepped in to help gamers who favour real money trade for example tools for the comparison of this secondary market have recently become more numerous eye on mogs online since december 2005 was the first site to tackle comparison of gold sellers another notable entry was gamerprice the which deployed bots to offer real time price results online since mid 2006 source netcraft others include mmofx gold price watcher and gameusd as mmorpgs continue to grow in popularity and the secondary markets grow with them some industry experts have suggested that secondary market sales may total more than subscription sales by 2009 services like those above are likely to become less curiosities and more accepted means of interacting with these markets virtual crime the monetary issue can give a virtual world problems similar to the real world in south korea where the number of computer game players is massive some have reported the emergence of gangs and mafia where powerful players would threaten beginners to give money for their protection and actually steal and rob other similar problems arise in other virtual economies in the game the sims online a 17 year old boy going by the in game name evangeline was discovered to have built a cyber brothel where customers would pay sim money for minutes of cybersex maxis cancelled each of his accounts but had he deposited his fortune in the gaming open market he would be able to keep a part of it as if deposited in a bank economy stability for a persistent world to maintain a stable economy a balance must be struck between currency sources and sinks generally games possess numerous sources of new currency for players to earn however some possess no effective sinks or methods of removing currency from circulation if other factors remain constant greater currency supply weakens the buying power of a given amount a process known as inflation in practice this results in constantly rising prices for traded commodities with the proper balance of growth in player base currency sources and sinks a virtual economy could remain stable indefinitely as in the real world actions by players can de stabilize the economy gold farming creates currency within the game more rapidly than usual exacerbating inflation in extreme cases a hacker may be able to hack into the system and create a large amount of money this could result in hyperinflation in the game as is the case with guild wars while the federal reserve bank usually manages to adjust interest rates to slow inflation of the u s dollar game operators have found this balance very difficult to maintain mudflation is a common problem in virtual economies capital in virtual economies in these virtual economies the value of in game resources is frequently tied to the in game power they confer upon the owner this power allows the user usually to acquire more rare and valuable items in this regard in game resources are not just tradable objects but can play the role of capital players also acquire human capital as they become more powerful powerful guilds often recruit powerful players so that player can acquire better items which can only be acquired by the cooperation among many players sometimes to the hundreds unlike in standard economies identities or characters can also be sold high level characters can be in these worlds the most valuable form of capital level 60 everquest characters reportedly have sold for as much as 5 000 usd depending on which industry expert you talk to valuations of the secondary market i e the real money trade of virtual commodities range from around 1 billion usd to 3 billion usd in 2006 in any case this is a very large and growing market other virtual economies virtual economies have also been said to exist in the metagame worlds of live

 id=1228884 title anarchist economics nonfiltered 1075 processed 1061 dbindex 1481085 anarchist economics entails theory and practice relating to economic activity within the philosophical outlines of anarchism anarchists most notably anarcho syndicalists and anarcho communists primarily oppose capitalism because they claim that its characteristic institutions promote and reproduce various forms of oppression including private property hierarchical production relations collecting rents from private property taking a profit in exchanges and collecting interest on loans individualist anarchists are mutualist rather than collectivist or communist they support possessive property rights but oppose usury defining usury as profit from others labor through rent capital interest and wage labor not paid full price finally anarcho capitalists fully support capitalism but only the totally free market laissez faire kind anarchist critique of capitalism alternative theories of value and currency many anarchists advocate the abolition of money but others call for a replacement of it with new value systems still others such as benjamin tucker want simply the end of the government money monopoly i e privatization of minting and banking and the repeal of legal tender laws gift economy gift economies are those based of free distribution of goods and services anarcho communists are the main proponents of such however many times this is said to refer to a planned economy which ensures everyones needs are satisfied in a way that allows a good quality of life the kind of planning advocated by most if not all anarchocommunists differs from that of firms and the so called command economies in that it is democratic and voluntary there are a number of variations on the concept but they are centered on the notion of from each according to ability to each according to need primitivists also advocate this kind of economy although they believe that it is not possible with current modes of production and thus advocate a return to pre industrial and often pre agricultural modes of production labor theory of value a labor theory of value ltv was notably advanced in different forms by david ricardo and karl marx ricardo held that the relative prices of most reproduceable goods and services were proportional to the amount of present and past labor time required to obtain manufacture process distribute and transport them marx s law of value is often interpreted as an analytic device elucidating the ways in which capitalism as a whole distributes socially necessary abstract labour time while revealing that an important characteristic of commodities and their value relations is commodity fetishism obscuring an underlying reality of exploitative social relations recently some local currencies have taken on ltv characteristics by having a currency based on time although participants are not primarily anarchists critics point out that in many of these time dollar based currencies it is really easy to inflate the currency that there is no way to ensure that people are not paid more than an hour per hour and conversely it ignores factors like value added work work that incorporates past labor in order to perform such as the time spent by a dentist in school one of the reasons that the irs has chosen not to tax local currencies is that they are used for charitable purposes such as community building some anarchists are interested in ltv currency systems because they make complex free market fair trade systems possible although in their current practices they are not applicable for anything other than local ie town sized economies detractors argue that the definition of a free market precludes usage of a normative pricing system but some anarchist point out that since participation in an ltv currency network is voluntary any ltv system is merely another choice in a free market of markets energy theory of value the theory that all values can be evaluated in terms of joules in the same vein as ltv this is an attempt to make a normative basis for value by accounting for embodied energy accounting for such a system would be vastly more complex than current or other theoretical currency systems because all energy output of workers and energy expenditure on goods services must be tracked something that is thought impossible and useless by many anarchists one group that has advocated a system using energy is the technocratic movement with a system based on energy credits where energy is used to buy a product or service without being exchanged so the effect is that products or services are distributed to the user without gain by the provider who has the same amount of energy in his or her account regardless so allegedly making profit impossible examples of anarchist economies utopia sometimes known as trialville was an individualist anarchist colony begun in 1847 by josiah warren and associates in the united states on a tract of land approximately 30 miles from cincinnati ohio see also mutualism and cincinnati time store the anarchist collectives formed during the spanish civil war is the most famous example of an anarchist economy operating on a large scale the collectives were formed under the influence of the anarcho syndicalist union the cnt in rural and urban areas and successfully practised self management for a number of years in extremely difficult economic and political circumstances other examples of self management include the factory committee movement during the russian revolution and the workplace occupations in argentina during its crisis at the turn of the 21st century attempts at forming co operatives also appeared during the paris commune of 1871 and the italian factory occupations of 1920 theoretical anarchist economic systems participatory economics michael albert and robin hahnel began to write about parecon in the 1980 s this work builds on their earlier critiques of both market based and centrally planned economies suggesting instead allocation by participatory planning created by the democratic interaction of a network of production and consumption councils parecon is a market abolitionist theory though not strictly an anarchist idea its core features of decentralized democratic planning institutions and remuneration based upon egalitarian norms and self management balanced job roles environmental responsibility and social efficiency appeals to many anarchists mutualism mutualism is a form of stateless market socialism advocated by individualist anarchists such as benjamin tucker they argued that a free market in credit increase competition between lenders make interest free loans available this would enable workers to buy their own means of production rather than having to sell their labour to a capitalist in order to survive resulting in a form of market socialism where workers cooperatives and self employed individuals freely exchange goods and services mutualism features a modification of the principle of private property whereby communities or private defense agencies would only protect ownership of land housing or workplaces on the basis of continual occupancy and use in what is property pierre jospeph proudhon highlighted the distinction between ownership coinciding with use possession and absentee ownership property arguing that communities should only protect the former proudhon also advocated that people create democratically controlled mutual credit associations or peoples banks similar to local currency systems rather than relying on the market to provide credit these would lend only to cooperative workplaces thus preventing the market from causing a relapse into capitalism technological ltv networks a revision of ltv that incorporates information technology cryptography and open source software to create a medium of exchange that precludes all forms of usury and thus requires no oversight or ideological guidance in contrast to parecon there is no planned economy because users of the system will approve of labor that they feel is necessary and so production happens as people fill the labor market as they will crucial to this system is the premise that money credit for work done can be improved with the addition of identity information and transparency i e all credits created are associated with a particular individual they are non transferable they inform users of the work done to create it and can be viewed by any user on the system there are no specifications for how decisions are made within these technological ltv systems each one is tasked to create its own ruleset joining such a network would be akin to signing a contract or eula so revision of rulesets would resemble the open source paradigm of updating software and having the user agree to a new ruleset decision making would then be implicit in any user s ability to participate in the revision of the system software even though this approach could be elitist prices on goods and services would be evaluated by the amount of credit earned by laborers involved requiring that every individual item or service be tracked production then represents a mirror of the credit creation so physical items would require their negative credit to be cancelled by a person wishing to own it since income distribution would be relatively flat in this system it is hoped that most of the problems of capitalist accumulation and class structure will be avoided panarchist synthesis this is the theory that all alternative economic systems could exist simultaneously though it may imply accepting a greater complexity of day to day living anarchists predicate this overlapping of systems on the removal of states and corporations and the presence of multiple currency paradigms in effect this would be analogous on an individual level to having various subscriptions or club memberships a level of complexity surpassed by the average american middle class consumer that holds several credit cards with various debts owes mortage and car payments and so forth the motive to adopt a panarchist approach to economics is the theory that not all goods services or resources are best exchanged regulated within a single system i e energy production is best tracked in kilowatt hours but collectible items have highly subjective values and therefore require a different exchange medium even parecon could be incorporated in this approach laissez faire capitalism separation of economics and state is the goal of anarcho capitalists they want an economy free from any coercive regulation or control anarcho capitalists generally see the state as the cause of all monopoly anarcho capitalists reject the labor theory of value as flawed and archaic thus like most modern economists they do not believe that there is any proper price for labor or goods other than what someone is willing to pay therefore unlike anarcho communists they do not wish to abolish money wages and trade according to rothard in an interview with new banner capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism the place of anarcho capitalism within anarchism is hotly debated economics as anarchist strategy some anti capitalist anarchists believe that it is not radical political activity that will transform society but radical economic activity that will make true change they regard boycotts consumer advocacy and class action lawsuits to be merely liberal actions that do not address the core problem which is capitalism itself some anarchists believe that changing the nature of work itself is the crux of defeating capitalism parecon addresses the division of labor question by advocating balanced job complexes wherein all workers at a production facility share in all aspects of labor i e everyone takes part in labor management maintenance and all related work in order to ensure equality and that skills are shared amongst workers some anarchists believe that changing personal consumption habits to minimize or eliminate entirely involvement in the prevailing capitalist economy is essential to practicing anarchism in their lives withdrawing from the system by living on scavenged stolen or scammed resources is often touted by situationists such as crimethinc as a viable means of survival and non participation in the system many anarchists support counter economics that is participating in the black illegal market use of alternative currencies is growing largely due to digital currencies offered on the internet and availability of software to manage local currency systems like lets since states cannot collect taxes and revenue through use of alternative currencies they will theoretically lose power to the point of collapse some of these alternative currencies are designed to prevent usury others are designed simply as alternatives to state issued fiat money as a hedge against inflation thus alternative currencies range from labor time notes to specie backed warehouse receipts three popular

 id=7689281 title sonoma coast state beach nonfiltered 1096 processed 1081 dbindex 1481106 sonoma coast state beach is a state of california property in sonoma county consisting of public access use on lands adjoining the pacific ocean this extent of beach runs from a coastal point about four miles north of jenner and continues for approximately seventeen miles to the south to terminate at bodega head the property lies along california state route 1 and consists of a number of named beaches including arched rock beach gleason beach and goat rock beach the ecosystem consists of alternating sandy beaches and rocky shoreline with a marine terrace extending above the entire extent with an upland california coastal prairie habitat geology this strip of coastal property is subject to continuing marine erosion as well as windborne erosion thus creating a situation where an average of one to three feet per year of land mass is lost obviously in years of heavy storms this value can be higher whereas in a less stormy year the land erosion can be lower over the last geologic epoch the land has been subject to uplift a process which has created a marine terrace of the entire extent of the property this marine terrace is elevated approximately 50 to 100 feet above mean sea level which results in a steep bluff directly above the littoral zone vertical rock formations are a geological hallmark of this site and have weathered far less than the bulk of the soils these features are known as sea stacks and they appear standing out of the water or on the beach as though as sculptures placed decoratively along the shoreline occasionally these stacks appear as adornments on the marine terrace indicating their ancient origin on the sea floor prior to uplift these rock formations are composed of sandstone with layers of quartz the active san andreas fault runs roughly parallel and near to the coastline of sonoma coast state beach soils within the site are classified as coastal beach sands where rocky shoreline is not evident and marine escarpment group soils on the marine terrace typically soils above the marine terrace are in the rohnerville loam group most of the beach sands consist of a medium coarse brown to gray sandy materials reflecting the high rate of erosion of escarpment soils into the ocean however there are patches of smooth pebble beach such as the approximately one hundred meter stretch lying immediately north of goat rock ecology the habitats include marine littoral and coastal prairie in the marine environment are found gray whales harbor seals and california sea lions as well as a multitude of fish species and other marine organisms there are also modest kelp beds and other marine vegetation the littoral beach environment has fewer organisms than more southerly zones because of the colder temperatures however there are tidepools which are abundant with marine flora and fauna the coastal prairie soils are moderately well drained and granular in nature with moderate soil permeability these features lead to slight erosion potential and moderately high bio productivity acidity of these loamy soils is medium to high and thus some vegetative stunting and hospitality to rare plants is offered the upland environment on the coastal prairie offers a variety of grasses and wildflowers including varieties of lupine thistle and wild oats the typical annual plant productivity is approximately 1500 kilograms per acre of air dried yield per annum in an abundant moisture year and about half that amount in a very dry year a variety of birds and mammals thrive on the coastal prairie including numerous california mule deer odocoileus hemionus californicus history some of the oldest natural history of this area related to mammals are a rock formation about one mile south of the russian river there is found a sea stack formation with prominent rubbing marks about two to four meters in elevation a height too high to have been caused by modern bovids mammoths are believed to have roamed here as recently as 40 000 years ago and they are thought to have created these severe rubbing marks mammoth fossil remains have been found at bodega head at the south end of sonoma coast state beach earliest known human settlement of this site was by the native american coast miwok and pomo tribes as early as 1849 archaeological finds were recorded on this property and to date dozens of prehistorical kitchen middens and other types of tribal habitation finds have been made the property is part of a mexican land grant called bodega rancho the russians are thought to have begun logging the old growth forests directly above the coastal prairie in the early 1800s the underwater delineation of the property is considered to extend to 1000 feet from the shoreline while no shipwrecks have been discovered the literature indicates that there are 17 vessels which may have been lost in these waters there are remains of numerous historic barns and other agricultural buildings on the coastal prairie indicating 19th century settlement by europeans at duncans landing there are iron pins embedded in the sandstone bluffs as evidence of the active shipping industry here in the late 1800s and early 1900s references see also miwok goat rock beach external links california state parks official site for sonoma coast state beach sonoma coast

hospital opened in 1907 in northeast philadelphia it originally followed the theory of physician benjamin rush that mental illness was a disease and could be cured with proper treatment but the mentally diseased should be kept away from normal people until they were actually cured it was home to people ranging from the mentally challenged to the criminally insane the primary buildings were constructed between 1910 and the mid 1920 s and the newer buildings were constructed between 1940 and 1953 it was composed of over fifty buildings which included male and female dormitories an infirmary kitchens laundry administration a chapel and a morgue the hospital s population grew rapidly quickly exceeding its capacity and conditions were extremely poor several investigations into the conditions at the hospital revealed that sewage lined the hallways and patients slept in the halls and administration mistreated and exploited patients as a result in 1936 the hospital was turned over to the state however the state possession changed nothing and further investigations publicized similar findings in his 1948 book the shame of the states albert deutsch described the horrid conditions he observed at byberry as i passed through some of byberry s wards i was reminded of the pictures of the nazi concentration camps i entered a building swarming with naked humans herded like cattle and treated with less concern pervaded by a fetid odor so heavy so nauseating that the stench seemed to have almost a physical existence of its own in the 1960 s the hospital began downsizing the downsizing continued until its closing horrible conditions continue in the mid 1980s philadelphia state hospital came under scrutiny when it was learned that violent criminals were being kept on the hospital s forensic ward n8 2a in 1985 the hospital failed a state inspection and was accused of misleading the inspection team about certain issues with overcrowding being the top problem reports of patient abuse were still rampant through the 1980s one patient had reported that one of his teeth was pulled without novacaine another famous story of patient abuse was that of william kirsch in 1987 who was shackled to a bed for 14 months another state inspection team was sent to evaluate the hospital in early 1987 by the summer of 87 5 of philadelphia state hospital s top officials were promptly fired after the hospital once again failed the state inspection closure of byberry on december 7th 1987 a press conference was held to announce the closing of the philadelphia state hospital the teams most recently performing investigations described the conditions as atrocious and irreversible though originally supposed to close the following year patient issues delayed the process mostly the fact that two released patients were found dead in the delaware river in two successive days after their release the hospital officially closed in june of 1990 with the remaining patients and staff having been transferred to norristown state hospital or local community centers period of abandonment 1990 2006 it did not take long for people to re discover byberry after it closed looters broke in several weeks after the closing and began to steal everything of value especially copper piping and wiring while contaminating the buildings with asbestos which prevented the city from demolishing the buildings in 1991 after the looters had removed everything of value vandals and urban explorers trespassed on the grounds explorers carefully wandered the hallways and corridors of their newley

builders of america would make its headquarters in kansas city kansas two and a half years later on the ninth of june 1896 the brotherhood affiliated with the american federation of labor in subsequent years the brotherhood continued to grow and in 1902 the helpers division was formed because helpers were barred from sitting in the lodge room with mechanics this new division had its own local unions and was entirely separate from the boiler makers this would change a decade later when the helpers division would be consolidated with the mechanics division in march 1906 at a special convention in kansas city the name of the union was changed to the international brotherhood of boilermakers iron ship builders and helpers of america in order to incorporate the newest division also

 id=95170 title pragmatism nonfiltered 1127 processed 1112 dbindex 1481138 pragmatism is a school of philosophy that originated with charles sanders peirce who first stated the pragmatic maxim and came to fruition in the early twentieth century philosophies of william james and john dewey most of the thinkers who describe themselves as pragmatists consider practical consequences or real effects to be vital components of both meaning and truth other important aspects of pragmatism include a thoroughgoing naturalism and anti cartesianism radical empiricism a combination of metaphysical realism and psychologism sometimes termed instrumentalism the reconciliation of anti skepticism and fallibilism and last but not least the primacy of practice pragmatism flourished at a time when psychology and epistemology weren t considered separate disciplines and is currently enjoying renewed attention in part due to the loosened grip of analytic philosophy within academia and the rising popularity of naturalized epistemology origins as a philosophical movement pragmatism originated in the united states in the late 1800s the thought and works of charles sanders peirce ipa p s william james and john dewey all members of the metaphysical club as well as george herbert mead figured most prominently in its overall direction the term pragmatism was first used in print by james who credited peirce with coining the term during the early 1870s prompted by james use of the term and its attribution to him peirce began writing and lecturing on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation peirce eventually coined the new name pragmaticism to mark what he regarded as the original idea more for clarity s sake than because he disagreed with james menand 2001 james and pierce were inspired by several earlier thinkers notably alexander bain who examined the crucial links among belief conduct and disposition by saying that a belief is a proposition on which a person is prepared to act earlier thinkers that inspired the pragmatists include david hume for his naturalistic account of knowledge and action thomas reid for his direct realism georg hegel for his introduction of temporality into philosophy francis bacon who coined the phrase knowledge is power and perhaps even the ancient sophists for their humanism and attention to informal logic pragmatist epistemology all pragmatist epistemology can be characterized by a broad emphasis on the importance of practical effects how theoretical ideas affect the human way of life in general and the life of inquiry in particular put more formally pragmatists are committed to an epistemological framework that interrelates causality and agency or rationality the epistemology of these early pragmatists was heavily influenced by darwinian thinking pragmatists were not the first to see the relevance of evolution for theories of knowledge the same rationale had convinced schopenhauer that we should adopt biological idealism because what s useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is actually true pragmatism differs from this idealist account because it challenges the assumption that knowledge and action are two separate spheres and that there exists an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond the sort of inquiry that organisms use to cope with life pragmatism in short provides what might be termed an ecological account of knowledge inquiry is construed as a means by which organisms can get a grip on their environment real and true are labels that have a function in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of that context it is plainly psychologist but also realist it assumes an external world which must be dealt with a general tendency by philosophers to push all views into either the idealist or realist camp as well as william james occasional penchant for eloquence at the expense of public understanding resulted in the widespread but false characterization of pragmatism as a form of subjectivism or idealism many of james best turned phrases truth s cash value james 1907 p 200 and the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking james 1907 p 222 were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as the representing the view that any idea that has practical utility is true william james writes it is high time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy the unwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything i know in recent philosophic history schiller says the true is that which works thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to the lowest material utilities dewey says truth is what gives satisfaction he is treated as one who believes in calling everything true which if it were true would be pleasant james 1907 p 90 in reality james asserts the theory is a great deal more subtle see dewey 1910 for a faq pragmatists do disagree with the view that beliefs must represent reality to be true copying is one only one genuine mode of knowing says james james 1907 p 91 and argue that beliefs are dispositions which qualify as true or false depending on how helpful they prove in inquiry and in action it is only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that theories acquire meaning and only with a theory s success in this struggle that it becomes true however most pragmatists do not hold that anything that is practical or useful or that anything that helps to survive merely in the short term should be regarded as true for example c s peirce takes the pragmatic theory to imply that theoretical claims should be tied to verification practices they should be subject to test truth is defined for peirce as the ultimate outcome i e not a real point in time of inquiry by a usually scientific community of investigators in an alternate reading dewey characterized truthfulness as a species of the good to state that something is true means stating that it is trustworthy or reliable and will remain so in every conceivable situation central pragmatist tenets the primacy of practice the action of an organism in its environment is the basic perspective from which the pragmatist proceeds and our human capability of theorizing is seen as integral to intelligent practice not on a separate sphere altogether theories and distinctions are tools or maps for finding our way in the world they abstract from our direct experience and ultimately have to come back to experience and explain the phenomena that gave rise to the theorizing so rendering those phenomena more meaningful john dewey noted that there is no question of theory versus practice but rather of intelligent practice versus uninformed stupid practice and noted in a conversation with william pepperell montague that his effort had not been to practicalize intelligence but to intellectualize practice quoted in eldridge 1998 p 5 anti reification of concepts and theories dewey in the quest for certainty criticized what he called the philosophical fallacy philosophers often take categories such as the mental and the physical for granted and because they don t realize that these are merely nominal concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems get entangled in all sorts of metaphysical and conceptual confusions david l hildebrand sums up the problem perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience hildebrand 2003 various examples are the ultimate being of hegelian philosophers the belief in a realm of value the idea that logic because it abstracts away from concrete thought has nothing to do at all with thinking and so on naturalism and anti cartesianism from the outset pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it more in line with science one of the problems with idealist and realist philosophy alike was their tendency to see human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp and they resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by kant or to vague theories about correspondence pragmatists critized the former because of its inability to relate meaningfully to the world as we experience it and the latter because it is a hollow theory that takes correspondence as an unanalyzable fact pragmatism instead tries to explain psychologically and biologically how the relation between knower and known actually works richard rorty expanded on these arguments in philosophy and the mirror of nature where he criticized the attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to and sometimes thought of as superior to the empirical sciences the reconciliation of anti skepticism and fallibilism hilary putnam suggests that the reconciliation of antiskepticism and fallibilism is the central claim of american pragmatism peirce insisted that contrary to descartes famous and influential method in the meditations on first philosophy doubt cannot be feigned or created for the purpose of conducting philosophical inquiry doubt like belief requires justification that is it arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact from what dewey called a situation which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition inquiry is then the rationally self controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter note that anti skepticism is a reaction to the modern academic skepsis in the wake of descartes the pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is actually quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition pragmatism in other fields of philosophy while pragmatism started out simply as a criterion of meaning it quickly expanded to become a full fledged epistemology with wide ranging implications for the entire philosophical field philosophy of science in the philosophy of science instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments whose worth is measured not by whether the concepts and theories somehow mirror reality but by how effective they are in explaining and predicting phenomena instrumentalism does not state that truth doesn t matter but is rather a specific solution to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science w v quine s paper two dogmas of empiricism published 1951 is one of the most celebrated papers of twentieth century philosophy in the analytic tradition the paper is an attack on two central parts of the logical positivists philosophy one is the distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths explained by quine as truths grounded only in meanings and independent of facts and truths grounded in facts the other is reductionism which is the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience quine s argument brings to mind peirce s insistence that axioms aren t a priori truths but synthetic statements logic later in his life schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook formal logic by then schiller s pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an ordinary language philosophy schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic by showing that words only had meaning when used in an actual context the criticism of schiller s book was nicely summarized by him near his death in an essay entitled are all men mortal the least famous of schiller s main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book formal logic in this sequel logic for use schiller attempts to construct a new logic to replace formal logic he has just decimated in formal logic what he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico deductive method whereas f c s schiller actually dismissed the possibility of formal logic most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic rather as one logical tool among others or perhaps considering the multitude of formal logics one set of tools among others c s peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic stephen toulmin s the uses of argument in essence an epistemological work inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies metaphysics james and dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained they were dissatisfied with ordinary empiricism because in the tradition dating from hume empiricists had a tendency to think of experience as nothing more than individual sensations to the pragmatists this went against the spirit of empiricism we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality radical empiricism or immediate empiricism in dewey s words wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms william james gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming young graduate began by saying that he had always taken for granted that when you entered a philosophic classroom you had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street the two were supposed he said to have so little to do with each other that you could not possibly occupy your mind with them at the same time the world of concrete personal experiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond imagination tangled muddy painful and perplexed the world to which your philosophy professor introduces you is simple clean and noble the contradictions of real life are absent from it in point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than a clear addition built upon it it is no explanation of our concrete universe james 1907 pp 8 9 f c s schiller s first book riddles of the sphinx was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in america in it schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics the result of the split between these two explanatory schemes that are comparable to what william james called tough minded empiricism and tender minded rationalism schiller contends is that mechanicistic naturalism cannot make sense of the higher aspects of our world freewill consciousness purpose universals and some would add god while abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the lower aspects of our world the imperfect change physicality while schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish he suggests metaphysics as a tool that can aid inquiry and is only valuable insofar as it actually does help in explanation in the second half of the twentieth century stephen toulmin argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what ultimate reality consists of more recently a similar idea has been suggested by the postanalytical philosopher daniel dennett who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to adopt the intentional stance and acknowledge both the syntactical aspects of reality i e whizzing atoms and its emergent or semantic properties i e meaning and value radical empiricism gives interesting answers to questions about the limits of science if there are any the nature of meaning and value and the workability of reductionism these questions feature prominently in current debates about the relationship between science and religion where it is often assumed most pragmatists would disagree that science degrades everything that is meaningful into merely physical phenomena philosophy of mind both john dewey in nature and experience 1929 and half a century later richard rorty in his monumental philosophy and the mirror of nature 1979 argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body result from conceptual confusions they argue instead that there is no need to posit the mind or mindstuff as an ontological category ethics pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason nor any ontological difference between facts and values both facts and values have cognitive content knowledge is what we should believe values are hypotheses about what is good in action pragmatist ethics is broadly humanist because it sees no ultimate test of morality beyond what matters for us as humans its basic idea is pretty straightforward good values are those for which we have good reasons viz the good reasons approach it predates other philosophers that have stressed important similarities between values and facts such as jerome schneewind and john searle william james contribution to ethics as laid out in his essay the will to believe has often been misunderstood as a plea for relativism or irrationalism more realistically it argues that ethics always involves a certain degree of trust or faith and that we cannot always wait on adequate proof when making moral decisions moral questions immediately present themselves as questions whose solution cannot wait for sensible proof a moral question is a question not of what sensibly exists but of what is good or would be good if it did exist a social organism of any sort whatever large or small is what it is because each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members will simultaneously do theirs wherever a desired result is achieved by the co operation of many independent persons its existence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in one another of those immediately concerned a government an army a commercial system a ship a college an athletic team all exist on this condition without which not only is nothing achieved but nothing is even attempted james 1896 of the classical pragmatists john dewey wrote most extensively about morality and democracy edel 1993 in his classic article about the three independent factors in morals dewey 1930 he tried to integrate the three basic perspectives on morality the right the virtuous and the good he holds that all three provide meaningful ways to think about moral questions and that the possibility of conflict between the three elements exists and cannot always be easily solved anderson sep dewey also criticized the dichotomy between means and ends which he saw as responsible for the degradation of our everyday working lives and education both conceived as merely a means to an end and stressed the need for meaningful labor and a conception of education not as a preparation for life but life itself dewey was opposed to other philosophies of his time notably the emotivism of alfred ayer dewey envisioned the possibility of ethics as an experimental discipline and thought values can be best characterized not as feelings or imperatives but as hypotheses about what actions will lead to satisfactory results or what he termed consummatory experience a further implication of this view is that because we re not always sure about what we want or don t always know if what we want is what would really satisfy us ethics is a fallible undertaking aesthetics john dewey s art and experience based on the william james lectures he delivered at harvard was an attempt to show the integrity of art culture and everyday experience field iep art for dewey is or should be a part of everyone s creative lives and not just the privilege of a select group of artists he also emphasizes that the audience is more than a passive recipient dewey s treatment of art was a move away from the transcendental approach to aesthetics in the wake of immanuel kant who emphasized the unique character of art and the disinterested nature of aesthetic appreciation philosophy of religion both dewey and james have investigated the role that religion can still play in contemporary society the former in a common faith and the latter in the varieties of religious experience it should be noted from a general point of view that for william james something is true only insofar as it works thus the statement for example that prayer is heard may work on a psychological level but a will not actually help to bring about the things you pray for b may be better explained by referring to its soothing effect than by claiming prayers are actually heard as such pragmatism isn t antithetical to religion but it isn t an apologetic for faith either analytical neoclassical and neopragmatism neopragmatism is a container for various thinkers some of them radically opposed to each other such as richard rorty and hilary putnam the name is usually taken to mean that the thinkers in question significantly diverge from the big three peirce james dewey either in their philosophical program many of them are loyal to the analytic tradition or in thought c i lewis was very critical of john dewey important analytical thinkers include the aforementioned c i lewis w v o quine donald davidson hilary putnam and the early work of richard rorty stanley fish the later rorty and jürgen habermas are closer to continental thought neoclassical pragmatism a handy denominator but not in widespread circulation denotes those thinkers that stay closer to the project of the classical pragmatists sidney hook and susan haack known for the theory of foundherentism are probably the most famous ones contrary to what the name might suggest neoclassical pragmatism is everything but conservative not all pragmatists are easily characterized point in case is stephen toulmin whose thought dovetails nicely with that of the neoclassical pragmatists but who arrived at it largely independently from either the classical or neoclassical tradition namely via wittgenstein who he calls in retrospect a pragmatist of a sophisticated kind foreword for dewey 1929 in the 1988 edition p xiii and who doesn t commonly identify himself as a pragmatist it is probable considering the advent of postanalytic philosophy and the diversification of anglo american philosophy that more philosophers will be influenced by pragmatist thought daniel dennett a student of quine is a good example without necessarily publicly committing themselves to that philosophical school contemporary echoes and ties in the twentieth century the movements of logical positivism behaviorism functionalism and ordinary language philosophy all have similarities with pragmatism like pragmatism logical positivism provides a verification criterion of meaning that is supposed to rid us of nonsense metaphysics however logical positivism doesn t stress action like pragmatism does furthermore the pragmatists rarely used their maxim of meaning to rule out all metaphysics as nonsense usually pragmatism was put forth to correct metaphysical doctrines or to construct empirically verifiable ones rather than to provide a wholesale rejection ordinary language philosophy is closer to pragmatism than other philosophy of language because of its nominalist character and because it takes the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between language and world pragmatism has ties to process philosophy much of their work developed in dialogue with process philosophers like henri bergson and alfred north whitehead who aren t usually considered pragmatists because they differ so much on other points douglas browning et al 1998 rescher sep criticism although many later pragmatists such as w v o quine were actually analytic philosophers the most vehement criticisms of classical pragmatism came from within that school of thought especially bertrand russell was known for his vituperative attacks on what he thought was little more than epistemological relativism and short sighted practicalism realists in general often could not fathom how pragmatists could seriously call themselves empirical or realist thinkers and thought pragmatist epistemology was but a disguised manifestation of idealism hildebrand 2003 edmund husserl criticized psychologism a critical aspect of pragmatist epistemology in his the prolegomena of pure logic gottlob frege an important founder of analytic philosophy did the same in his the foundations of arithmetic their criticism is honest but not decisive it remains to be seen if indeed psychology because of its naturalism had to miss entirely the accomplishment the radical and genuine problem of the life of the spirit as husserl claimed in the vienna lecture it need hardly be said that pragmatists insist that the exact opposite is the case pragmatism suffered another kind of depreciation because of the immense popularity of analytic philosophy and its ahistorical attitude after their deaths the classical pragmatists were either ignored forgotten or caricatured this is especially the case with schiller secondary sources on the work of schiller are extremely rare as are his primary works by some schiller is considered one of the philosophers who gave pragmatism a bad name by his over the top rhetoric and defense of a crude and unsophisticated form of pragmatism neopragmatism in the vein of richard rorty has been criticized as relativistic both by neoclassical pragmatists such as susan haack haack 1997 and by many analytic philosophers dennett 1998 rorty s early analytical work however differs notably from his later work which some including rorty himself consider to be closer to literature criticism than to philosophy proper most criticism is aimed at this latter phase of rorty s thought a list of pragmatists classical pragmatists 1850 1950 charles sanders peirce 1839 1914 was the founder of american pragmatism later called by

 id=1174091 title game over nonfiltered 1140 processed 1125 dbindex 1481151 game over is the ending text of many video games notably used in pinball machines and later arcade games it has since been adopted widely and is now commonly associated with video games in general history early the phrase was used at the end of games whether the player has won the game or not early devices such as electromechanical pinball machines would light up the phrase with a lamp lightbulb this usage was carried over into arcade games early video arcade games such as space invaders have the phrase game over simply superimposed on the screen while more recent games usually have a separate game over screen some arcade games additionally used the game over not only to indicate the end of the game but also to signify that the game was not currently being played a flashing game over would appear over a demo of the game to indicate that it was not in use modern the usage of game over varies most games of today have dropped the usage of game over for a successful completion of the game and instead use other ending texts such as the end or an outro and credits sequence game over is then only used to signify failure though some series continue to use the phrase for all endings with the advance of computing power modern game over screens tend to be more elaborate than mere flashing text the phrase may be animated and accompanied by graphics furthermore many modern games don t actually use game over as the failing ending text for example the resident evil series uses the ending text you are dead or you died in a font that resembles bloody slashes mortal kombat 4 contains a gory game over sequence in which the beaten fighter falls down a chasm into a spike pit if they run out of credits or choose not to continue many other variant texts exist from mission failed to your adventure has ended to good night to dead end to you lose occasionally the screen contains no text at all but merely a picture as in dracula or duke nukem time to kill the phrase can also be spoken by someone off screen as the scores are shown such as in the series or by the head of one of the antagonist characters as in crash bandicoot 2 and crash bandicoot warped bad endings a game over is not necessarily the same thing as a bad ending a bad ending occurs when the player finishes the game but is not completely successful for some reason bad endings are usually ending branches where the player has chosen poorly or otherwise failed some task for example the main character agrees to join the villain and rule together the damsel in distress is not freed or the curse afflicting a character is not broken and that character is dead in the ending these endings usually have their own unique screens and results distinct from a standard death twists on usage as games have matured new twists have been found to keep game over sequences unique in prince of persia the sands of time for instance the game is related as a story being narrated by the prince if the prince or farah dies the prince stumbles a bit and says no wait that didn t happen may i start again or no no she didn t die i defeated those monsters and moved on shall i restart the metal gear series is particularly notorious for breaking the fourth wall and has exploited the game over screen in game events in metal gear solid 2 several bizarre events occur one of which is the sudden switch to the mission failed screen except that the phrase fission mailed is in the corner with the gameplay continuing in the small window that normally shows the main character s dead body metal gear solid 3 snake eater continues this tradition with a fake death pill that when taken shows the game over screen though the player can still access items and revive themselves also if you happen to wait long enough on the game over screen the letter change and re arrange to read time paradox a reference to the fact the game is a prequel to the previous metal gear solid games the events in the games would not have happened if the main character actually died at this point cultural influences the usage of the words game over in english certainly predates even pinball machines however modern usage outside of gaming usually at least references the end of a computer video game meaning it is sometimes used to signify an abrupt and nasty end similar to the one a player might meet in such a video game in the 1986 film aliens bill paxton s character hudson uses the phrase to indicate what he thinks is a hopeless situation game over man game over this phrase shortened to game over man was later used as part of the game over screen of the snes game alien³ based on the film of the same name in the 2004 film saw the film concludes with tobin bell s character locking leigh whannell s in a bathroom to die and saying game over japanese pink film director hisayasu sato often concludes his films abruptly with the use of the legend game

 id=667349 title dynamic systems development method nonfiltered 1141 processed 1126 dbindex 1481152 dynamic systems development method dsdm is a framework originally based upon rapid application development rad dsdm utilizes continuous user involvement in an iterative development and incremental approach which is responsive to changing requirements to develop a software system that satisfies the business requirements on time and on budget dsdm is one of a number of agile methods for developing software and it forms a part of the agile alliance dsdm was developed in the united kingdom in the 1990s by the dsdm consortium of vendors and experts in the field of information system is development by combining their best practice experiences the dsdm consortium is a non profit vendor independent organisation which owns and administers the framework the first version was completed in january 1995 and was published in february 1995 the current version in use as of april 2006 is version 4 2 framework for business centered development released in may 2003 dsdm public version 4 2 www dsdm org was made available for individuals to view and use in july 2006 however anyone reselling dsdm must still be a member of the not for profit consortium as an extension of rapid application development dsdm focuses on information systems projects that are characterized by tight schedules and budgets dsdm addresses the common reasons for information systems project failure including exceeding budgets missing deadlines and lack of user involvement and top management commitment dsdm consists of 3 phases pre project phase project life cycle phase and post project phase the project life cycle phase is subdivided into 5 stages feasibility study business study functional model iteration design and build iteration and implementation dsdm recognizes that projects are limited by time and resources and plans accordingly to meet the business needs in order to achieve these goals dsdm encourages the use of rad with the consequent danger that too many corners are cut dsdm applies some principles roles and techniques in some circumstances there are possibilities to integrate practices from other methodologies such as rational unified process rup extreme programming xp and prince2 as complements to dsdm another agile method that has some similarity in process and concept to dsdm is scrum principles of dsdm there are 9 underlying principles of dsdm consisting of four foundations and five starting points for the structure of the method these principles form the cornerstones of development using dsdm user involvement is the main key in running an efficient and effective project where both users and developers share a workplace so that the decisions can be made accurately the project team must be empowered to make decisions that are important to the progress of the project without waiting for higher level approval dsdm focuses on frequent delivery of products with assumption that to deliver something good enough earlier is always better than to deliver everything perfectly in the end by delivering product frequently from an early stage of the project the product can be tested and reviewed where the test record and review document can be taken into account at the next iteration or phase the main criteria for acceptance of deliverable in dsdm is on delivering a system that addresses the current business needs it is not so much directed at delivering a perfect system addressing all possible business needs but focuses its efforts on critical functionality development is iterative and incremental driven by users feedback to converge on an effective business solution all changes during the development are reversible the high level scope and requirements should be base lined before the project starts testing is carried out throughout the project life cycle see test driven development for comparison communication and cooperation among all project stakeholders is required to be efficient and effective dsdm is also supported by some other principles or so called assumptions no system is built perfectly in the first try the pareto principle 80 20 rule in the process of developing an information system 80 of the business benefit comes from 20 of the system requirements therefore dsdm starts implementing this first 20 of system requirements to meet 80 of the business needs which is good enough as long as the users are intimately involved in the development process and in a position to ensure that the missing 20 would not cause any serious business consequences implementing the entire requirements often causes the project to go over deadlines and budgets therefore it is most times unnecessary to construct the perfect solution project delivery should be on time on budget and with good quality dsdm only requires each step of the development to be completed far enough for the next step to begin this way a new iteration of the project can commence without having to wait for the previous to be completed entirely and with every iteration the system is improved incrementally recall that the business requirements are changing over time at any rate both project management and development techniques are incorporated in dsdm dsdm can also be used in both new projects and for expanding current systems risk assessment should focus on business function being delivered not on the construction process nor on development process artifacts such as requirements and design documents management rewards product delivery rather than task completion estimation should be based on business functionality instead of lines of code prerequisites for using dsdm in order for dsdm to be a success a number of prerequisites need to be realized first there needs to be interactivity between the project team future end users and higher management this addresses well known failures of is development projects due to lack of top management motivation and or user involvement the second important prerequisite for dsdm projects is the decomposability of the project the possibility of decomposition into smaller parts enables the iterative approach and activities that are hard to prioritize often cause delays exactly the effect that dsdm was developed to avoid another group of projects for which dsdm is not well suited are safety critical ones the extensive testing and validation found in these kinds of projects conflict with dsdm goals of being on time and on budget finally projects that aim at re usable components might not be well suited for development using dsdm because the demands on perfection are too high and conflict with the 80 20 principle described earlier process data diagram of dsdm project life cycle below is the process data diagram of dsdm as a whole with all of its 5 stages this diagram depicts the dsdm iterative development started on functional model iteration design and build iteration and implementation phase the description of each stage will be explained later in this entry the phases of dsdm the dsdm framework consists of three sequential phases namely the pre project project life cycle and post project phases the project phase of dsdm is the most elaborate of the three phases the project life cycle phase consists of 5 stages that form an iterative step by step approach in developing an is the three phases and corresponding stages are explained extensively in the subsequent sections for each stage phase the most important activities are addressed and the deliverables are mentioned phase 1 the pre project in the pre project phase candidate projects are identified project funding is realized and project commitment is ensured handling these issues at an early stage avoids problems at later stages of the project phase 2 the project life cycle the process overview in the figure above shows the project life cycle of this phase of dsdm it depicts the 5 stages a project will have to go through to create an is the first two stages the feasibility study and business study are sequential phases that complement to each other after these phases have been concluded the system is developed iteratively and incrementally in the functional model iteration design build iteration and implementation stages the iterative and incremental nature of dsdm will be addressed further in a later section stage 1 the feasibility study during this stage of the project the feasibility of the project for the use of dsdm is examined prerequisites for the use of dsdm are addressed by answering questions like can this project meet the required business needs is this project suited for the use of dsdm and what are the most important risks involved the most important techniques used in this phase are the workshops the deliverables for this stage are the feasibility report and the feasibility prototype that address the feasibility of the project at hand it is extended with a global outline plan for the rest of the project and a risk log that identifies the most important risks for the project stage 2 the business study the business study extends the feasibility study after the project has been deemed feasible for the use of dsdm this stage examines the influenced business processes user groups involved and their respective needs and wishes again the workshops is one of the most valuable techniques workshops in which the different stakeholders come together to discuss the proposed system the information from these sessions is combined into a requirements list an important property of the requirements list is the fact that the requirements are can be prioritized these requirements are prioritized using the moscow approach based on this prioritization a development plan is constructed as a guideline for the rest of the project an important project technique used in the development of this plan is timeboxing this technique is essential in realizing the goals of dsdm namely being on time and on budget guaranteeing the desired quality a system architecture is another aid to guide the development of the is the deliverables for this stage are a business area definition that describes the context of the project within the company a system architecture definition that provides an initial global architecture of the is under development together with a development plan that outlines the most important steps in the development process at the base of these last two documents there is the prioritized requirements list this list states all the requirements for the system organized according to the moscow principle and last the risk log is updated with the facts that have been identified during this phase of dsdm stage 3 functional model iteration the requirements that have been identified in the previous stages are converted to a functional model this model consists of both a functioning prototype and models prototyping is one of the key project techniques within this stage that helps to realize good user involvement throughout the project the developed prototype is reviewed by different user groups in order to assure quality testing is implemented throughout every iteration of dsdm an important part of testing is realized in the functional model iteration the functional model can be subdivided into four sub stages identify functional prototype determine the functionalities to be implemented in the prototype that results from this iteration agree schedule agree on how and when to develop these functionalities create functional prototype develop the prototype investigate refine and consolidate it with the combined functional prototype of previous iterations review prototype check the correctness of the developed prototype this can be done via testing by end user then use the test records and user s feedbacks to generate the functional prototyping review document the deliverables for this stage are a functional model and a functional prototype that together represent the functionalities that could be realized in this iteration ready for testing by users next to this the requirements list is updated deleting the items that have been realized and rethinking the prioritization of the remaining requirements the risk log is also updated by having risk analysis of further development after reviewing the prototyping document meta data model of functional model iteration the associations between concepts of deliverables in functional model iteration stage are depicted in the meta data model below this meta data model will be combined with the meta process diagram of functional model iteration phase in the next part process data diagram of functional model iteration identify functional prototype activity is to identify the functionalities that would be in the prototype of current iteration recall that both analysis and coding are done prototypes are built and the experiences gained from them are used in improving the analysis models based also on updated prioritized requirements list and updated risk log the built prototypes are not to be entirely discarded but gradually steered towards such quality that they can be included in the final system agree schedule is to determine when and how the prototyping will be implemented it extends the scope to the available timetable and prototyping plan and since testing is implemented throughout the whole process it s also an essential part of this phase and therefore it is included in the review prototype activity right after the functional prototype is built and the test record will eventually be used in the review prototype process and generates the review document below is the process data diagram of functional model iteration stage stage 4 design and build iteration the main focus of this dsdm iteration is to integrate the functional components from the previous phase into one system that satisfies user needs it also addresses the non functional requirements that have been set for the is again testing is an important ongoing activity in this stage the design and build iteration can be subdivided into four sub stages identify design prototype identify functional and non functional requirements that need to be in the tested system agree schedule agree on how and when to realize these requirements create design prototype create a system that can safely be handed to end users for daily use they investigate refine and consolidate the prototype of current iteration within prototyping process are also important in this sub stage review design prototype check the correctness of the designed system again testing and reviewing are the main techniques used since the test records and user s feedbacks are important to generate the user documentation the deliverables for this stage are a design prototype during the phase that end users get to test and at the end of the design and build iteration the tested system is handed over to the next phase in this stage the system is mainly built where the design and functions are consolidated and integrated in a prototype another deliverable for this stage is a user documentation stage 5 implementation in the implementation stage the tested system including user documentation is delivered to the users and training of future users is realized the system to be delivered has been reviewed to include the requirements that have been set in the beginning stages of the project the implementation stage can be subdivided into four sub stages user approval and guidelines end users approve the tested system for implementation and guidelines with respect to the implementation and use of the system are created train users train future end user in the use of the system implement implement the tested system at the location of the end users review business review the impact of the implemented system on the business a central issue will be whether the system meets the goals set at the beginning of the project depending on this the project goes to the next phase the post project or loops back to one of the preceding phases for further development the deliverables for this stage are a delivered system on location ready for use by the end users trained users and detailed project review document of the system phase 3 post project the post project phase ensures the system operating effectively and efficiently this is realized by maintenance enhancements and fixes according to dsdm principles the maintenance can be viewed as continuing development based on the iterative and incremental nature of dsdm instead of finishing the project in one cycle usually the project can return to the previous phases or stages so that the previous step and the deliverable products can be refined core techniques of dsdm timeboxing timeboxing is one of the project techniques of dsdm it is used to support the main goals of dsdm to realize the development of an is on time within budget and with the desired quality the main idea behind timeboxing is to split up the project in portions each with a fixed budget and a delivery date for each portion a number of requirements are selected that are prioritized according to the moscow principle because time and budget are fixed the only remaining variables are the requirements so if a project is running out of time or money the requirements with the lowest priority are omitted this does not mean that an unfinished product is delivered because of the pareto principle that 80 of the project comes from 20 of the system requirements so as long as those most important 20 of requirements are implemented into the system the system therefore meets the business needs and that no system is built perfectly in the first try moscow moscow represents a way of prioritizing items in the context of dsdm the moscow technique is used to prioritize requirements it is an acronym that stands for must have this requirement to meet the business needs should have this requirement if at all possible but the project success does not rely on this could have this requirement if it does not affect the fitness of business needs of the project would have this requirement at later date if there is some time left or in the future development of the system an elaborate explanation of the moscow principle can be found here prototyping this technique refers to the creation of prototypes of the system under development at an early stage of the project it enables the early discovery of shortcomings in the system and allows future users to test drive the system this way good user involvement is realized one of the key success factors of dsdm or any system development project for that matter testing a third important aspect of the goal of dsdm is the creation of an is with good quality in order to realize a solution of good quality dsdm advocates testing throughout each iteration since dsdm is a tool and technique independent method the project team is free to choose its own test management method for example tmap workshop one of dsdm s project techniques that aims at bringing the different stakeholders of the project together to discuss requirements functionalities and mutual understanding in a workshop the stakeholders come together and discuss the project modelling this technique is essential and purposely used to visualise the diagrammatic representation of a specific aspect of the system or business area that is being developed modelling gives a better understanding for dsdm project team over a business domain configuration management a good implementation of this configuration management technique is important for the dynamic nature of dsdm since there is more than one thing being handled at once during the development process of the system and the products are being delivered frequently at a very fast rate the products therefore need to be controlled strictly as they achieve partial completion roles of dsdm there are some roles introduced within dsdm environment it is important that the project members need to be appointed to different roles before they start to run the project each role has its own responsibility the roles are executive sponsor so called the project champion an important role from the user organization who has the ability and responsibility to commit appropriate funds and resources this role has an ultimate power to make decisions visionary the one who has the responsibility to initialize the project by ensuring that essential requirements are found early on visionary has the most accurate perception of the business objectives of the system and the project another task is to supervise and keep the development process in the right track ambassador user brings the knowledge of user community into the project ensures that the developers receive enough amount of user s feedbacks during the development process advisor user can be any user that represents an important viewpoint and brings the daily knowledge of the project project manager can be anyone from user community or it staff who manages the project in general technical co ordinator responsible in designing the system architecture and control the technical quality in the project team leader leads his team and ensures that the team works effectively as a whole developer interprete the system requirements and model it including developing the deliverablecodes and build the prototypes tester checks the correctness in a technical extents by performing some testings tester will have to give some comments and documentation scribe responsible to gather and record the requirements agreements and decisions made in every workshop facilitator responsible in managing the workshops progress acts as a motor for preparation and communication specialist roles business architect quality manager system integrator etc iterative and incremental nature next to timeboxing and prioritizing of requirements the dsdm also provides an iterative and incremental approach to is development this can be seen in the figure depicting the process overview above the functional model iteration design build iteration and implementation stages are all depicted in an iterative manner that shows that each of these stages can go over the different sub stages several times before entering the next stage every iteration addressing a set of new functionalities thanks to the incremental development approach every iteration is build on a functioning predecessor and each increment can be turned back when if needed next to this property the figure also shows arrows going back to previous stages for example there is an arrow going back from implementation to the business study if a big functionality has been discovered during development that couldn t be implemented it might be possible to start all over by defining new requirements in a business study another example of stepping back to a previous stage is the arrow from implementation to the functional model iteration this could be the case when functionality had to be omitted during the previous functional model iteration because of time and or budget constraints only when all the requirements needed to realize the set project and business goals are met will the project proceed into the post project phase because of the iterative nature of dsdm it is essential to maintain good requirements management and configuration management in place throughout the entire project this ensures that the project does implement the desired requirements in the desired fashion as was decided in the early phases of the project critical success factors of dsdm within dsdm a number of factors are identified as being of great importance to ensure successful projects factor 1 first there is the acceptance of dsdm by senior management and other employees this ensures that the different actors of the project are motivated from the start and remain involved throughout the project factor 2 the second factor follows directly from this and that is the commitment of management to ensure end user involvement the prototyping approach requires a strong and dedicated involvement by end user to test and judge the functional prototypes factor 3 then there is the project team this team has to be composed of skillful members that form a stable union an important issue is the empowerment of the project team this means that the team or one or more of its members has to posses the power and possibility to make important decisions regarding the project without having to write formal proposals to higher management which can be very time consuming in order for the project team to be able to run a successful project they also need the right technology to conduct the project this means a development environment project management tools etc factor 4 finally dsdm also states that a supportive relationship between customer and vendor is required this goes for both projects that are realized internally within companies or by outside contractors an aid in ensuring a supporting relationship could be ispl meta model meta modeling as explained in the wikipedia item meta modeling takes a higher level look at methods and techniques in doing so it offers possibilities for comparing similar methods and techniques and engineering new methods from existing ones the meta data model depicted below identifies the concepts and associations between these concepts within dsdm as can be seen from the figure two main concepts can be identified namely the phase and the flow concept each flow originates from a phase within dsdm flows can be divided up in the sub concepts data and product this subdivision is denoted with a c which means that the subdivision is disjoint and complete in other words a flow is always either a data flow or a product flow but never both in the situation of dsdm a data flow can be an arc returning to one of the preceding phases product flows are tangible goods that result from one of the phases and are the input of the next phase for example reports and prototypes then there is the second concept phase that is also be divided two sub concepts with a complete and disjoint ordering these sub concepts are the sequential and the iterative phases as was explained in an earlier section dsdm starts with two sequential phases the feasibility and business study next a number of iterative phases follow i e functional model design build and implementation phases the picture also mentions a number of rules and issues that are not included in the model but that are important for this meta model first there are the rules that concerns the behavior of the flows these rules restrict the freedom of the flows so that they correspond to the phase transitions within dsdm next to the rules a number of important issues are addressed that ensure that the dsdm project life cycle is guaranteed comparison to other is development methods over the years a great number of information system development methods have been developed and applied divided in structured methods rad methods and object oriented methods many of these methods show similarities to each other and also to dsdm for example extreme programming xp also has an iterative approach to is development with extensive user involvement the rational unified process is a method that probably has the most in common with dsdm in that it is also a dynamic form of information system development again the iterative approach is used in this development method like xp and rup there are many other development methods that show similarities to dsdm but dsdm does distinguish itself from these methods in a number of ways first there is the fact that it provides a tool and technique independent framework this allows users to fill in the specific steps of the process with their own techniques and software aids of choice another unique feature is the fact that the variables in the development are not time resources but the requirements this approach

 id=8092892 title wimbledon effect nonfiltered 1143 processed 1128 dbindex 1481154 the wimbledon effect is a chiefly british and japanese analogy which possibly originated in japan which compares the tennis fame of the all england lawn tennis and croquet club in wimbledon london with the economic success of the united kingdom s financial services industries especially those clustered in the city of london the point of the analogy is that the all england club and the city are highly successful despite the lack of local champions the championships wimbledon at the all england club is the most internationally prestigious tennis event despite the rarity of british winners london s financial industry has boomed since the deregulation of u k financial markets the big bang in the 1980s under the thatcher government but has also become dominated by foreign companies especially american investment banks rather than british firms a result opposite to the original intention of the reforms the analogy is typically used to mark a debate over whether it matters if an industry is primarily domestically owned if easing of foreign ownership restrictions allows the economy to benefit from foreign investment and increased global competition the phrase can be used positively to assert the economic success of liberal attitudes towards foreign ownership and sometimes to emphasize that such attitudes promote a level playing field for domestic and foreign interests alike or it can be used negatively to emphasize how these policies have eroded a nation s ability to produce globally leading domestic companies this opposing perspective is represented by economic patriotism and national champion policies the analogy has also been used in policy discourses outside britain most notably in the business discourse of japan whose financial markets and other parts of the economy as of 2006 have not yet been substantially opened up to foreign competition compared with its international peers it has also for instance been used in banking reform debates in south korea as well as in discussing business process outsourcing in india see also economic globalization references and external links banks warn against wimbledon effect korea times november 21 2006 wheeling dealing newsweek january 23 2006 the competitive position of london as a global financial centre report by corporation of london z yen november 2005 spate of takeover bids sign of economic strength the financial times 14 november 2005 buying british the guardian 1 november 2005 importing success leader the guardian 19 june 2004 our agenda is to be mr asia knowledge wharton november 5 2003 foreign penetration of japan s investment banking market will japan experience the wimbledon effect discussion paper by nicole pohl shorenstein asia pacific research center stanford university july 2002 foreigners at the wheel asiaweek september 22 2000 a fearful symmetry the spectator june 1998 analytica glossary of japanese financial terms endofarticle doc doc

as the unquestioned leading city of the world however after peaking in population in 1950 the city slowly declined with changes in industry and commerce urban sprawl outside the city and crime reaching something of a crisis period in the 1970s post war through mid century as many of the world s great cities lay in ruin after world war ii new york city assumed a new global prominence even becoming home to united nations headquarters built 1947 1952 after the war new york inherited the role of paris as center of the art world with abstract expressionism and became a rival to london as an art market however the population declined after 1950 with increasing suburbanization in the new york metropolitan area as pioneered in levittown new york prosperity was accompanied by an unprecendented building boom beginning around 1950 and lasting for about twenty years this led to a drastic change in the appearance of especially midtown and downtown manhattan where bland office towers in the new international style began to replace the ziggurat style towers of the postwar era also rapidly changing was the eastern edge of the east village close to the fdr drive large scale public housing projects supplanted many traditional apartment blocks in a built out city construction always entailed destruction after the old beaux arts pennsylvania station was torn down growing concern for preservation led to the creation of the landmarks preservation commission law of 1965 the city s other great train station grand central was also threatened with demolition but was eventually saved meanwhile new york city s network of freeways spread under the guidance of developer robert moses with consequent increased traffic congestion in 1960 after lord buckley s death the hated new york city cabaret card required of nightclub workers was abolished the federal immigration act of 1965 abolished national origin quotas and laid the basis for the city s modern asian american community economic tribulation had by then begun an early sign of the city s waning competitiveness was the loss of both its national league baseball teams to booming california the dodgers and the giants both moved after the 1957 season only one was replaced by the mets in 1962 on november 9 1965 new york endured a widespread power blackout along with much of eastern north america the

little improvement in black citizens inadequate housing education and employment but added to the city s growing reputation as unsafe the stonewall rebellion a series of violent conflicts between lesbians gay men bisexual and transgender people and police officers known as the stonewall riots and collectively as the stonewall rebellion is credited with catalyzing the modern lgbt rights movement worldwide the first night of rioting began on friday june 27 1969 not long after 1 20 a m when police raided the stonewall inn a gay bar in greenwich village it was one of the first times in modern history a significant number of lgbt people collectively resisted arrest by the end of july the gay liberation front glf was formed in new york and by the end of the year the glf could be seen in cities and universities around the united states similar organizations were soon created in other countries including canada france britain germany belgium the netherlands australia and new zealand the following year in commemoration of the stonewall riots the glf organized a march from greenwich village to central park between 5 000 and 10 000 men and women attended the march a precursor to the contemporary lgbt pride parades 1970s the 1970s are widely regarded as new york s nadir the city had become notorious the world over for high rates of crime and other social disorder a popular song in

highlight was the opening of the mammoth world trade center complex in 1972 conceived by david rockefeller and built by the port authority of new york and new jersey on the site of the radio row electronics district in lower manhattan the twin towers briefly displaced the empire state building in midtown as the world s tallest before being displaced in turn by chicago s sears tower in 1973 however the financial crisis high crime rates and damage from the blackouts led to a widespread belief that new york city was in irreversible decline many white middle class families moved to the city s suburbs and to other economically healthier locales by the end of the 1970s nearly a million people had left a population loss not recovered for another twenty years the election of the more

 id=30543 title alhambra nonfiltered 1149 processed 1134 dbindex 1481160 this article is about the alhambra in granada spain for other meanings see alhambra disambiguation the alhambra arabic al amr literally the red is an ancient palace and fortress complex of the moorish monarchs of granada in southern spain known as al andalus when the fortress was constructed occupying a hilly terrace on the south eastern border of the city of granada it was the residence of the muslim kings of granada and their court but is currently a museum exhibiting exquisite islamic architecture overview this terrace or plateau which measures about 740 m 2430 ft in length by 205 m 674 ft at its greatest width extends from w n w to e s e and covers an area of about 142 000 m² it is enclosed by a strongly fortified wall which is flanked by thirteen towers the river darro which foams through a deep ravine on the north divides the plateau from the albaicín district of granada the assabica valley containing the alhambra park on the west and south and beyond this valley the almost parallel ridge of monte mauror separate it from the antequeruela district history the name alhambra signifying in arabic the red al hamra is probably derived from the colour of the sun dried tapia or bricks made of fine gravel and clay of which the outer walls are built some authorities however hold that it commemorates the red flare of the torches by whose light the work of construction was carried on nightly for many years others associate it with the name of the founder muhammed ibn al ahmar and others derive it from the arabic dar al amra house of the master the palace was built chiefly between 1248 and 1354 in the reigns of al ahmar and his successors but even the names of the principal artists employed are either unknown or doubtful the splendid arabesques of the interior are ascribed among other kings to yusef i mohammed v ismail i etc after the christian conquest of the city in 1492 the conquerors began to alter the alhambra the open work was filled up with whitewash the painting and gilding effaced the furniture soiled torn or removed charles v 1516 1556 rebuilt portions in the renaissance style of the period and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a renaissance style structure which has never been completed philip v 1700 1746 italianised the rooms and completed his palace right in the middle of what had been the moorish building he ran up partitions which blocked up whole apartments in subsequent centuries under spanish authorities moorish art was further defaced and in 1812 some of the towers were blown up by the french under count sebastiani while the whole buildings narrowly escaped the same fate napoleon had tried to blow up the whole complex just before his plan was carried out a soldier who secretly wanted the plan of napoleon his commander to fail defused the explosives and thus saved the alhambra for posterity in 1821 an earthquake caused further damage the work of restoration undertaken in 1828 by the architect josé contreras was endowed in 1830 by ferdinand vii and after the death of contreras in 1847 it was continued with fair success by his son rafael d 1890 and his grandson mariano setting the situation of the alhambra is one of rare natural beauty the plateau commands a wide view of the city and plain of granada towards the west and north and of the heights of the sierra nevada towards the east and south moorish poets described it as a pearl set in emeralds in allusion to the brilliant colour of its buildings and the luxuriant woods round them the park alameda de la alhambra which in spring is overgrown with wild flowers and grass was planted by the moors with roses oranges and myrtles its most characteristic feature however is the dense wood of english elms brought thither in 1812 by the duke of wellington the park is celebrated for the multitude of its nightingales and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades these are supplied through a conduit 8 km 5 miles long which is connected with the darro at the monastery of jesus del valle above granada in spite of the long neglect wilful vandalism and sometimes ill judged restoration which the alhambra has endured it remains the most perfect example of moorish art in its final european development freed from the direct byzantine influences which can be traced in the mezquita cathedral of córdoba more elaborate and fantastic than the giralda at seville the majority of the palace buildings are in ground plan quadrangular with all the rooms opening on to a central court and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles designed on the same principle though varying in dimensions and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages in every case the exterior is left plain and austere as if the architect intended thus to heighten by contrast the splendour of the interior within the palace is unsurpassed for the exquisite detail of its marble pillars and arches its fretted ceilings and the veil like transparency of its filigree work in stucco sun and wind are freely admitted and the whole effect is one of the most airy lightness and grace blue red and a golden yellow all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure are the colours chiefly employed the decoration consists as a rule of stiff conventional foliage arabic inscriptions and geometrical patterns wrought into arabesques of almost incredible intricacy and ingenuity painted tiles are largely used as panelling for the walls a tour of the alhambra the moorish portion of the alhambra resembles many medieval christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle a palace and a residential annexe for subordinates the alcazaba or citadel its oldest part is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the north west that is all massive outer walls towers and ramparts are left on its watch tower the torre de la vela 25 m 85 ft high the flag of ferdinand and isabella was first raised in token of the spanish conquest of granada on january 2 1492 a turret containing a huge bell was added in the 18th century and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881 beyond the alcazaba is the palace of the moorish kings or alhambra properly so called and beyond this again is the alhambra alta upper alhambra originally tenanted by officials and courtiers access from the city to the alhambra park is afforded by the puerta de las granadas gate of pomegranates a massive triumphal arch dating from the 15th century a steep ascent leads past the pillar of charles v a fountain erected in 1554 to the main entrance of the alhambra this is the puerta judiciaria gate of judgment a massive horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower and used by the moors as an informal court of justice a hand with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye is carved above this gate on the exterior a key the symbol of authority occupies the corresponding place on the interior a narrow passage leads inward to the plaza de los aljibes place of the cisterns a broad open space which divides the alcazaba from the moorish palace to the left of the passage rises the torre del vino wine tower built in 1345 and used in the 16th century as a cellar on the right is the palace of charles v a cold looking but majestic renaissance building out of harmony with its surroundings which it tends somewhat to dwarf by its superior size the extremely intricate and detailed designs of the moors alhambra stand in stark contrast to charles palace which consists primarily of white walls with no particularly striking features many modern architectural scholars are thus disgusted by charles v s preference for simplistic renaissance styling which they believe detracts from the alhambra s architectural magnificence construction of charles palace begun in 1526 was abandoned about 1650 the present entrance to the palacio árabe or casa real moorish palace is by a small door from which a corridor conducts to the patio de los arrayanes court of the myrtles also called the patio de la alberca court of the blessing or court of the pond from the arabic birka pool this court is 42 m 140 ft long by 22 m 74 ft broad and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement full of goldfish and with myrtles growing along its sides there are galleries on the north and south sides that on the south 7 m 27 ft high and supported by a marble colonnade underneath it to the right was the principal entrance and over it are three elegant windows with arches and miniature pillars from this court the walls of the torre de comares are seen rising over the roof to the north and reflected in the pond the salón de los embajadores hall of the ambassadors is the largest in the alhambra and occupies all the torre de comares it is a square room the sides being 12 m 37 ft in length while the centre of the dome is 23 m 75 ft high this was the grand reception room and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance it was in this setting that cristopher columbus received isabel and ferdinand s support to sail to the new world the tiles are nearly 4 ft 1 2 m high all round and the colours vary at intervals over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions interwoven with flowers and leaves there are nine windows three on each facade and the ceiling is admirably diversified with inlaid work of white blue and gold in the shape of circles crowns and stars a kind of imitation of the vault of heaven the walls are covered with varied stucco work of most delicate pattern surrounding many ancient escutcheons the celebrated patio de los leones court of the lions is an oblong court 116 ft 35 m in length by 66 ft 20 m in breadth surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns a pavilion projects into the court at each extremity with filigree walls and light domed roof elaborately ornamented the square is paved with coloured tiles and the colonnade with white marble while the walls are covered 5 ft 1 5 m up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles with a border above and below enamelled blue and gold the columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed with a view to artistic effect and the general form of the piers arches and pillars is most graceful they are adorned by varieties of foliage etc about each arch there is a large square of arabesques and over the pillars is another square of exquisite filigree work in the centre of the court is the celebrated fountain of lions a magnificent alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble not designed with sculptural accuracy but as emblems of strength and courage it has been said that the lions were most likely sculpted by members of the caliphate s christian community as making such representational sculpture was not considered allowed by the followers of islam the sala de los abencerrajes hall of the abencerrages derives its name from a legend according to which the father of boabdil last king of granada having invited the chiefs of that illustrious line to a banquet massacred them here this room is a perfect square with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base the roof is exquisitely decorated in blue brown red and gold and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner opposite to this hall is the sala de las dos hermanas hall of the two sisters so called from two very beautiful white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement these slabs measure 50 by 22 cm 15 by 7 in and are without flaw or stain there is a fountain in the middle of this hall and the roof a dome honeycombed with tiny cells all different and said to number 5000 is a magnificent

cypress avenues are said to retain their original moorish character the villa de los martires martyrs villa on the summit of monte mauror commemorates by its name the christian slaves who were employed to build the alhambra and confined here in subterranean cells the torres bermejas vermilion towers also on monte mauror are a well preserved moorish fortification with underground cisterns stables and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men several roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of monte mauror in the construction of the alhambra the moors had no depictions of

ali shah regarding not fixing the cases before it when the proceedings of the court started it was pointed out to the bench that a fax has been received from chief justice syed sajjad ali shah with the direction to the assistant registrar quetta registry that no case should be fixed for hearing before the said bench until further orders one of the senior judge observed that it is misconduct on the part of chief justice as none of the supreme court judge can be restrained from the work on executive order and said that judicial order had already suspended the chief justice to perform his

court since as he said he was obliged to uphold the constitution of pakistan gen karamat pointed out that there was an established chain of command and any instructions of that sort should have come from the elected prime minister and the president who is also the supreme commander reinforcing his argument general karamat said a precedent would have been established if he had acted on the former chief justice shah s request promoting chief justices of provincial high courts to make demands on corps commanders to deal with certain situations that s why he said he decided to keep the army out of the political trappings the attack on supreme court pakistan grappled with its worst ever constitutional crisis when an unruly mob stormed into the supreme court forcing chief justice sajjad ali

scotland as mary ii of scotland from 11 april 1689 until her death mary a protestant came to the thrones following the glorious revolution which resulted in the deposition of her roman catholic father james ii mary reigned jointly with her husband and first cousin william iii who became the sole ruler of both countries upon her death in 1694 popular histories usually refer to the joint reigns as those of william and mary mary although a sovereign in her own right did not wield power during most of her reign instead ceding it to her husband she did however govern the realms when william was engaged in military campaigns abroad early life mary born at st james palace in london on 30 april 1662 was the eldest daughter of james duke of york the future james ii of england and of his first wife lady anne hyde mary s uncle was king charles ii her maternal grandfather edward hyde 1st earl of clarendon served for a lengthy period as charles s chief advisor although her mother bore eight children only mary and her younger sister anne survived into adulthood the duke of york converted to roman catholicism in 1668 or 1669 but mary and anne had a protestant upbringing pursuant to the command of charles ii mary s mother died in 1671 her father married again in 1673 taking as his second wife the catholic mary of modena also known as mary beatrice d este at the age of fifteen princess mary became betrothed to the protestant stadtholder william prince of orange william was the son of her aunt mary princess royal and prince william ii of nassau at first charles ii opposed the alliance with a dutch ruler he preferred that mary marry the heir to the french throne the dauphin louis but later under pressure from parliament and with a coalition with the catholic french no longer politically favourable he approved the union pressured by parliament the duke of york agreed to the marriage falsely assuming that it would improve his popularity amongst protestants the first cousins mary and william married in london on 4 november 1677 mary reportedly wept throughout the ceremony mary went to the netherlands where she lived as william s consort although she was devoted to her husband the marriage was often unhappy her three pregnancies ended in miscarriage or stillbirth and her childlessness would be the greatest source of unhappiness in mary s life her animated and personable nature made her popular with the dutch people but her husband was often cold and neglectful and long maintained an affair with elizabeth villiers one of mary s ladies in waiting though over time he became more relaxed in mary s company the glorious revolution upon the death of charles ii without legitimate issue in 1685 the duke of york became king as james ii in england and ireland and as james vii in scotland he had a controversial religious policy his attempt to grant freedom of religion to non anglicans was not well received as the technique he chose was to annul acts of parliament by royal decree several protestant politicians and noblemen entered into negotiations with mary s husband as early as 1687 after james took the step of forcing anglican clergymen to read the declaration of indulgence the proclamation granting religious liberty to dissenters from their churches in may 1688 his popularity plunged alarm amongst protestants increased when his wife queen mary gave birth to a son james francis edward in june 1688 for the son would unlike mary and anne be raised a roman catholic some charged that the boy was supposititious having been secretly smuggled in to queen s room in a bed warming pan as a substitute for her stillborn baby although there was no evidence to support the allegation mary publicly challenged the boy s legitimacy sending a pointed list of questions to her sister anne regarding the circumstances of the birth on 30 june the immortal seven secretly requested william then in the netherlands with mary to come to england with an army at first william was reluctant he was jealous of his wife s position as the heiress to the english crown and feared that she would become more powerful than he was mary however convinced her husband that she did not care for political power telling him she would be no more but his wife and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him king for life william agreed to invade and issued a declaration which referred to james new born son as the pretended prince of wales he also gave a list of grievences of the english people and stated that his proposed expedition was for the sole purpose of having a free and lawful parliament assembled the dutch army finally landed on 5 november having been turned back by a storm in october the disaffected english army and navy went over to william and english people s confidence in james stood so low that they did not attempt to save their king on 11 december the defeated king attempted to flee but was intercepted a second attempt at flight on 23 december was successful james escaped to france where he lived in exile until his death mary was upset by the circumstances surrounding the deposition of her father but william ordered her to appear cheerful on their triumphant arrival in london as a result she was criticised for appearing cold to her father s plight james too wrote a diatribe against her criticising her disloyalty an action which deeply affected the pious mary in 1689 a convention parliament summoned by the prince of orange assembled and much discussion relating to the appropriate course of action ensued william of orange felt insecure about his position he wished to reign as a king rather than function as a mere consort of a queen the only precedent for a joint monarchy dated from the sixteenth century when queen mary i married the spanish prince philip it was agreed that the latter would take the title of king but philip ii remained king only during his wife s lifetime and restrictions were placed on his power william however demanded that he remain king even after his wife s death although some prominent statesmen proposed to make her the sole ruler mary remaining loyal to her husband refused on 13 february 1689 parliament passed the declaration of right in which it deemed that james by attempting to flee on 11 december 1688 had abdicated the government of the realm and that the throne had thereby become vacant parliament offered the crown not to james s eldest son james francis edward who would have been the heir apparent under normal circumstances but to william and mary as joint sovereigns it was however provided that the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said prince of orange in the names of the said prince and princess during their joint lives the declaration was later extended to exclude not only james and his heirs from the throne but all catholics since it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince the bishop of london henry compton crowned william and mary together at westminster abbey on 11 april 1689 normally the archbishop of canterbury performs coronations but the archbishop at the time william sancroft although an anglican refused to recognise the validity of james ii s removal on the day of the coronation the convention of the estates of scotland which was much more divided than the english parliament finally declared that james was no longer king of scotland william and mary were offered the separate scottish crown the two kingdoms were not united until the acts of union in 1707 they accepted on 11 may even after the declaration there was still substantial support for james in scotland the viscount of dundee raised an army and won a convincing victory at killiecrankie on 27 july the huge losses suffered by dundee s troops coupled with his fatal wounding at the start of the battle served to remove the only effective resistance to william and the uprising was quickly crushed suffering a resounding defeat the next month at the battle of dunkeld reign in december 1689 parliament passed one of the most important constitutional documents in english history the bill of rights this measure which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier declaration of right established restrictions on the royal prerogative it declared amongst other things that the sovereign could not suspend laws passed by parliament levy taxes without parliamentary consent infringe the right to petition raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent deny the right to bear arms to protestant subjects unduly interfere with parliamentary elections punish members of either house of parliament for anything said during debates require excessive bail or inflict cruel or unusual punishments the bill of rights also addressed the question of succession to the throne following the death of either william iii or mary ii the other was to continue to reign next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple to be followed by mary s sister anne and her children last in the line of succession stood any children william iii might have had from any subsequent marriage from 1690 onwards william often remained absent from england at first fighting jacobites in ireland whilst her husband was away mary administered the government of the realm she proved a firm ruler ordering the arrest of her own uncle henry hyde 2nd earl of clarendon for plotting to restore james ii to the throne in 1692 she dismissed and imprisoned the influential john churchill 1st earl of marlborough on similar charges the dismissal somewhat diminished her popularity and harmed her relationship with her sister anne who was strongly influenced by churchill s wife sarah anne appeared at court with sarah obviously supporting the disgraced churchill which led to mary angrily demanding that anne dismiss sarah and vacate her lodgings mary later failed to visit anne during her pregnancy and relations remained strained until mary s death william had crushed the irish jacobites by 1692 but he continued with campaigns abroad in order to wage war against france in the netherlands when her husband was away mary acted in her own name but on his advice whilst he was in england mary completely refrained from interfering in political matters as had been agreed in the bill of rights she did however participate in the affairs of the church all matters of ecclesiastical patronage passed through her hands she died of smallpox at kensington palace on the 28th december 1694 and was buried at westminster abbey upon her death baroque composer henry purcell of england was commissioned to write her funeral music entitled music for the funeral of queen mary the ominous march catalogued as z860 a has subsequently been used in other media such as the title theme in the movie a clockwork orange william who had grown increasingly to rely on mary was devastated by her death reportedly said that from being the happiest he was now going to be the miserablest creature on earth legacy after mary ii s death william iii continued to rule as king princess anne s last surviving child william duke of gloucester died in july 1700 and as it was clear that william iii would have no more children parliament passed the act of settlement 1701 which provided that the crown would go to the nearest protestant relative sophia electress of hanover and her protestant heirs when william iii died in 1702 he was succeeded by anne and she in turn was succeeded by the son of the deceased electress sophia george i mary endowed the college of william and mary in the present day

 id=9738 title e mail nonfiltered 1184 processed 1169 dbindex 1481196 electronic mail abbreviated e mail or often email is a store and forward method of composing sending storing and receiving messages over electronic communication systems the term e mail as a noun or verb applies both to the internet e mail system based on the simple mail transfer protocol smtp and to intranet systems allowing users within one organization to e mail each other often these workgroup collaboration organizations may use the internet protocols for internal e mail service origins of e mail e mail predates the internet existing e mail systems were a crucial tool in creating the internet mit first demonstrated the compatible time sharing system ctss in 1961 it allowed multiple users to log into the ibm 7094 from remote dial up terminals and to store files online on disk this new ability encouraged users to share information in new ways e mail started in 1965 as a way for multiple users of a time sharing mainframe computer to communicate although the exact history is murky among the first systems to have such a facility were sdc s q32 and mit s ctss e mail was quickly extended to become network e mail allowing users to pass messages between different computers the messages could be transferred between users on different computers by 1966 but it is possible the sage system had something similar some time before the arpanet computer network made a large contribution to the evolution of e mail there is one report which indicates experimental inter system e mail transfers on it shortly after its creation in 1969 ray tomlinson initiated the use of the sign to separate the names of the user and their machine in 1971 the arpanet significantly increased the popularity of e mail and it became the killer app of the arpanet modern internet e mail how internet e mail works the diagram above shows a typical sequence of events that takes place when alice composes a message using her mail user agent mua she types in or selects from an address book the e mail address of her correspondent she hits the send button her mua formats the message in internet e mail format and uses the simple mail transfer protocol smtp to send the message to the local mail transfer agent mta in this case smtp a org run by alice s internet service provider isp the mta looks at the destination address provided in the smtp protocol not from the message header in this case bob b org an internet e mail address is a string of the form localpart domain example which is known as a fully qualified domain address fqda the part before the sign is the local part of the address often the username of the recipient and the part after the sign is a domain name the mta looks up this domain name in the domain name system to find the mail exchange servers accepting messages for that domain the dns server for the b org domain ns b org responds with an mx record listing the mail exchange servers for that domain in this case mx b org a server run by bob s isp smtp a org sends the message to mx b org using smtp which delivers it to the mailbox of the user bob bob presses the get mail button in his mua which picks up the message using the post office protocol pop3 this sequence of events applies to the majority of e mail users however there are many alternative possibilities and complications to the e mail system alice or bob may use a client connected to a corporate e mail system such as ibm s lotus notes or microsoft s exchange these systems often have their own internal e mail format and their clients typically communicate with the e mail server using a vendor specific proprietary protocol the server sends or receives e mail via the internet through the product s internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting if alice and bob work for the same company the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate e mail system alice may not have a mua on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service alice s computer may run its own mta so avoiding the transfer at step 1 bob may pick up his e mail in many ways for example using the internet message access protocol by logging into mx b org and reading it directly or by using a webmail service domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail when the main mail exchange server is not available emails are not secure if email encryption is not used correctly it used to be the case that many mtas would accept messages for any recipient on the internet and do their best to deliver them such mtas are called open mail relays this was important in the early days of the internet when network connections were unreliable if an mta couldn t reach the destination it could at least deliver it to a relay that was closer to the destination the relay would have a better chance of delivering the message at a later time however this mechanism proved to be exploitable by people sending unsolicited bulk e mail and as a consequence very few modern mtas are open mail relays and many mtas will not accept messages from open mail relays because such messages are very likely to be spam note that the people e mail addresses and domain names in this explanation are fictional see alice and bob internet e mail format the format of internet e mail messages is defined in rfc 2822 and a series of rfcs rfc 2045 through rfc 2049 collectively called multipurpose internet mail extensions mime although as of july 13 2005 see rfc 2822 is technically a proposed ietf standard and the mime rfcs are draft ietf standards these documents are the de facto standards for the format of internet e mail prior to the introduction of rfc 2822 in 2001 the format described by rfc 822 was the de facto standard for internet e mail for nearly two decades it is still the official ietf standard the ietf reserved the numbers 2821 and 2822 for the updated versions of rfc 821 smtp and rfc 822 honoring the extreme importance of these two rfcs rfc 822 was published in 1982 and based on the earlier rfc 733 internet e mail messages consist of two major sections header structured into fields such as summary sender receiver and other information about the e mail body the message itself as unstructured text sometimes containing a signature block at the end the header is separated from the body by a blank line internet e mail header the message header consists of fields usually including at least the following from the e mail address and optionally name of the sender of the message to the e mail address and optionally name of the receiver of the message subject a brief summary of the contents of the message date the local time and date when the message was originally sent each header field has a name and a value rfc 2822 specifies the precise syntax informally the field name starts in the first character of a line followed by a followed by the value which is continued on non null subsequent lines that have a space or tab as their first character field names and values are restricted to 7 bit ascii characters non ascii values may be represented using mime encoded words note that the to field in the header is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered the actual delivery list is supplied in the smtp protocol not extracted from the header content the to field is similar to the greeting at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope also note that the from field does not have to be the real sender of the e mail message it is very easy to fake the from field and let a message seem to be from any mail address it is possible to digitally sign e mail which is much harder to fake some internet service providers do not relay e mail claiming to come from a domain not hosted by them but very few if any check to make sure that the person or even e mail address named in the from field is the one associated with the connection some internet service providers apply e mail authentication systems to e mail being sent through their mta to allow other mtas to detect forged spam that might apparently appear to be from them other common header fields include cc carbon copy received tracking information generated by mail servers that have previously handled a message content type information about how the message has to be displayed usually a mime type many e mail clients present bcc blind carbon copy recipients not visible in the to field as a header field since the entire header is visible to all recipients bcc is not included in the message header addresses added as bcc are only added to the smtp delivery list and do not get included in the message data iana maintains a list of standard header fields e mail content encoding e mail was originally designed for 7 bit ascii much e mail software is 8 bit clean but must assume it will be communicating with 7 bit servers and mail readers the mime standard introduced charset specifiers and two content transfer encodings to encode 8 bit data for transmission quoted printable for mostly 7 bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data the 8bitmime extension was introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings but many mail transport agents still don t support it fully for international character sets unicode is growing in popularity saved message filename extension most but not all e mail clients save individual messages as separate files or allow users to do so different applications save e mail files with different filename extensions eml this is the default e mail extension for mozilla thunderbird and is used by microsoft outlook express emlx used by apple mail msg used by microsoft office outlook messages and mailboxes messages are exchanged between hosts using the simple mail transfer protocol with software like sendmail users can download their messages from servers with standard protocols such as the pop or imap protocols or as is more likely in a large corporate environment with a proprietary protocol specific to lotus notes or microsoft exchange servers mail can be stored either on the client on the server side or in both places standard formats for mailboxes include maildir and mbox several prominent e mail clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer e mail between them when a message cannot be delivered the recipient mta must send a bounce message back to the sender indicating the problem spamming and e mail worms the usefulness of e mail is being threatened by three phenomena spamming phishing and e mail worms spamming is unsolicited commercial e mail because of the very low cost of sending e mail spammers can send hundreds of millions of e mail messages each day over an inexpensive internet connection hundreds of active spammers sending this volume of mail results in information overload for many computer users who receive tens or even hundreds of junk messages each day e mail worms use e mail as a way of replicating themselves into vulnerable computers although the first e mail worm affected unix computers the problem is most common today on the more popular microsoft windows operating system the combination of spam and worm programs results in users receiving a constant drizzle of junk e mail which reduces the usefulness of e mail as a practical tool a number of anti spam techniques mitigate the impact of spam in the united states u s congress has also passed a law the can spam act of 2003 attempting to regulate such e mail australia also has very strict spam laws restricting the sending of spam from an australian isp http www aph gov au library pubs bd 2003 04 04bd045 pdf but its impact has been minimal since most spam comes from regimes that seem reluctant to regulate the sending of spam privacy problems regarding e mail e mail privacy without some security precautions can be compromised because e mail messages are generally not encrypted e mail messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages many internet service providers isp store copies of your e mail messages on their mail servers before they are delivered the backups of these can remain up to several months on their server even if you delete them in your mailbox the received headers and other information in the email can often identify the sender preventing anonymous communication there are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above for example virtual private networks or the tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while gpg pgp or s mime can be used for end to end message encryption and smtp starttls or smtp over transport layer security secure sockets layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the smtp client and the smtp server another risk is that e mail passwords might be intercepted during sign in one may use encrypted authentication schemes such as sasl to help prevent this see also e mail

 id=232940 title war on poverty nonfiltered 1190 processed 1175 dbindex 1481202 the war on poverty was first introduced by lyndon b johnson during his state of the union address on january 8 1964 legislation proposed by johnson was designed in response to the poverty of over 35 million americans that year and followed difficult economic conditions associated with a national poverty rate of around 19 the war on poverty speech led congress to pass the economic opportunity act a law that established the office of economic opportunity oeo to administrate the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty as a part of the great society johnson s view of a federally directed application of resources to expand the government s role in social welfare programs from education to healthcare was a continuation of franklin delano roosevelt s new deal and four freedoms speech from the 1930s and 1940s the concept of a war on poverty waned after the 1960s deregulation growing criticism of the welfare state and an ideological shift to reducing federal aid to impoverished people in the 1980s and 1990s culminated in the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 that bill clinton claimed end welfare as we know it nonetheless the legacy of the war on poverty remains in the continued existence of such federal programs as head start and job corps background this administration today here and now declares unconditional war on poverty in america michael harrington s book the other america 1962 is sometimes credited with being a catalyst in this moment major initiatives economic opportunity act of 1964 august 20 1964 social security act of 1965 july 30 1965 the office of economic opportunity was the agency responsible for administering most of the war on poverty programs created during united states president lyndon b johnson s administration including vista job corps head start though that program was later transferred to the department of health education and welfare legal services and the community action program the oeo was established in 1964 and quickly became a target of both left wing and right wing critics of the war on poverty directors of the oeo included sargent shriver bertrand harding and donald rumsfeld the oeo launched project head start as an eight week summer program in 1965 the project was designed to help end poverty by providing preschool children from low income families with a program that would meet emotional social health nutritional and psychological needs head start was then transferred to the office of child development in the department of health education and welfare later the department of health and human services by the nixon administration in 1969 the job corps trains disadvantaged and at risk youth and has provided more than 2 million disadvantaged young people with the integrated academic vocational and social skills training they need to gain independence and get quality long term jobs or further their education job corps continues to help 70 000 youths annually at 122 job corps centers throughout the country besides vocational training many job corps also offers ged programs as well as high school diplomas and programs to get students into college criticisms president johnson s war on poverty speech was delivered at a time of recovery the poverty level had fallen from 22 4 in 1959 to 19 in 1964 when the war on poverty was announced and it was viewed by critics as an effort to get the united states congress to authorize social welfare programs many economists such as milton friedman have argued that johnson s policies actually had a negative impact on the economy due to their interventionist nature economists such as these recommend that the best way to fight poverty is not through government welfare but through economic growth results and legacy in the decade following the 1964 introduction of the war on poverty poverty rates in the u s dropped to 11 1 and has remained between 11 and 15 ever since since 1973 poverty has remained well below the historical u s averages in the range of 20 25 poverty among americans between ages 18 64 has fallen only marginally since 1966 from 10 5 then to 10 1 today poverty has significantly fallen among americans under 18 years old from 23 in 1964 to 16 3 today the most dramatic decrease in poverty was among americans over 65 which fell from 28 5 in 1966 to 10 1 today in 2004 more than 35 9 million or 12 of americans including 12 1 million children were considered to be living in poverty with an average growth of almost 1 million per year the oeo was dismantled by president nixon in 1973 though many of the agency s programs were transferred to other government agencies according to the readers companion to u s women s history many observers point out that the war on poverty s attention to black america created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s the perception by the white middle class that it was footing the bill for ever increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods many whites viewed great society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low income urban minorities they lost sympathy especially as the economy declined during the 1970s historical notes the u s government continues to use the antiquated orshansky measure of the poverty line a measure which is only adjusted for inflation and not adjusted for the actual cost of living against median income in the 1960s the average cost of living was 30 of individual income though in recent years the cost of living averages to 50 of household income because of this skew in measuring the poverty line some believe that the current u s census statistics published could actually be closer to 50 million americans references article from the

 id=209963 title fluid bearing nonfiltered 1204 processed 1189 dbindex 1481216 fluid bearings are bearings which solely support the bearing s loads on a thin layer of liquid or gas they can be broadly classified as fluid dynamic bearings hydrostatic or gas bearings they are frequently used in high load high speed or high precision applications where ordinary ball bearings have short life or high noise and vibration they are also used increasingly to reduce cost for example hard disk drive motor fluid bearings are both quieter and cheaper than the ball bearings they replace operation fluid bearings use a thin layer of liquid or gas fluid between the bearing faces typically sealed around or under the rotating shaft there are two principal ways of getting the fluid in to the bearing in gas bearings and hydrostatic bearings the fluid is pumped in through an orifice or through a porous material in hydrodynamic bearings the bearing rotation sucks the fluid on to the inner surface of the bearing forming a lubricating wedge under or around the shaft hydrostatic bearings rely on an external pump the power for that pump is arguably part of overall bearing friction better seals can reduce leak rates and pumping power but may increase friction hydrodynamic bearings rely on bearing motion to suck fluid in to the bearing and may have high friction and short life at low speeds or during starts and stops thus a secondary bearing may be used for startup and shutdown to prevent damage to the hydrodynamic bearing a secondary bearing may have high friction and short operating life but good overall service life if bearing starts and stops are infrequent characteristics and principles of operation fluid bearings can be relatively cheap compared to other bearings with a similar load rating the bearing can be as simple as two smooth surfaces with seals to keep in the working fluid in contrast a conventional bearing may require many high precision rollers with complicated shapes hydrostatic and gas bearings do have the complication and expense of external pumps most fluid bearings require little or no maintenance and have almost unlimited life conventional mechanical ball bearings usually have shorter life and require regular maintenance pumped hydrostatic and aerostatic gas bearing designs retain low friction down to zero speed and need not suffer start stop wear provided the pump does not fail fluid bearings generally have very low friction far better than mechanical bearings one source of friction in a fluid bearing is the viscosity of the fluid hydrostatic gas bearings are among the lowest friction bearings however lower fluid viscosity also typically means fluid leaks faster from the bearing surfaces thus requiring increased power for pumps or seals since no rigid mechanical element supports load it may seem fluid bearings can give only low precision in practice fluid bearings have clearances that change less under load are stiffer than mechanical bearings it might seem that bearing stiffness as with maximum design load would be a simple function of average fluid pressure and the bearing surface area in practice when bearing surfaces are pressed together the fluid outflow is greatly constricted this significantly increases the pressure of the fluid between the bearing faces as fluid bearings faces are comparatively large areas even small fluid pressure differences cause large restoring forces maintaining the gap it is also very difficult to make a mechanical bearing which is atomically smooth and round and mechanical bearings deform in high speed operation due to centripetal force in contrast fluid bearings self correct for minor imperfections fluid bearings are typically quieter and smoother more consistent friction than mechanical bearings for example hard disks manufactured with fluid bearings have noise ratings for bearings motors on the order of 20 24 db which is a little more than the background noise of a quiet room drives based on rolling element bearings are typically at least 4 db noisier some fluid bearings foil bearings foil bearings are a type of air bearing that was introduced in turbine applications in the 1960s by garrett airesearch they use a gas as the working fluid usually air journal bearings pressure oiled journal bearings appear to be plain bearings but are arguably fluid bearings for example journal bearings in gasoline petrol and diesel engines pump oil at low pressure in to a large gap area of the bearing as the bearing rotates oil is carried in to the working part of the bearing where it is compressed with oil viscosity preventing the oil s escape as a result the bearing hydroplanes on a layer of oil rather than on metal on metal contact as it may appear this is an example of a hydrodynamic bearing which does not use a secondary bearing for start stop in this application a large part of the bearing wear occurs during startup and shutdown though in engine use substantial wear is also caused by hard combustion contaminants that bridge the oil film hockey air hockey is a game based on an aerostatic bearing which suspends the puck and player s paddles to provide low friction and thus fast motion the bearing uses a flat plane with periodic orifices which deliver air just over ambient pressure the puck and paddles rest on air one part of ice hockey is ice skating ice skates are a hydrodynamic fluid bearing where the skate and ice are separated by a layer of water caused by entropy formerly thought to be caused by pressure induced melting see ice skating for details kingsbury michell tilting pad fluid bearings kingsbury michell dynamic tilting pad fluid bearings were invented independently and almost simultaneously by both the american tribologist albert kingsbury and a british born australian anthony george maldon michell the bearing has shoes or pads on pivots when the bearing is in operation the rotating part of the bearing carries fresh oil in to the pad area fluid pressure causes the pad to tilt slightly building a wedge of pressurised fluid between the shoe and the other bearing surface the pad tilt adaptively changes with bearing load and speed various design details ensure continued replenishment of the oil to avoid overheating and pad damage kingsbury michell fluid bearings are used in a wider variety of heavy duty rotating equipment including in hydroelectric plants to support turbines and generators weighing hundreds of tons they are also used in very heavy machinery such as submarine propeller shafts the first tilting pad bearing in service was probably that built under a g m michell s guidance by george weymoth pty ltd for a centrifugal pump at cohuna on the murray river victoria australia in 1907 just two years after michell had published and patented his three dimensional solution to reynold s equation by 1913 the great merits of the tilting pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications the first english ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross channel steamer the paris but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the first world war the practical results were spectacular the troublesome thrust block became dramatically smaller and lighter significantly more efficient and remarkably free from maintenance troubles it was estimated that the royal navy saved coal to a value of 500 000 in 1918 alone as a result of fitting michell s tilting pad bearings according to the asme see reference link the first kingsbury michell fluid bearing in the usa was installed in the holtwood hydroelectric power plant on the susquehanna river near lancaster pennsylvania usa in 1912 the 2 25 tonne bearing supports a water turbine and electric generator with a rotating mass of about 165 tonnes and water turbine pressure adding another 40 tonnes the bearing has been in nearly continuous service since 1912 with no parts replaced the asme reported it was still in service as of 2000 as of 2002 the manufacturer estimated the bearings at holtwood should have a maintenance free life of about 1 300 years external links michell bearing co asme history brochure

rather than the more specialised surveys of attenborough s later productions each of the twelve 50 minute episodes features a different aspect of the journey through life from birth to adulthood and continuation of the species through reproduction the series was produced in conjunction with the australian broadcasting service and turner broadcasting system inc the executive producer was peter jones and the music was composed by george fenton part of david attenborough s life series it was preceded by the living planet 1984 and followed by life in the freezer 1993 background the series took over three and a half years to film during which time attenborough travelled almost a quarter of a million miles the production team sought to further push the boundaries of natural history filmmaking following on from the advances made in the living planet and were provided with several new challenges the sequence of chimpanzees hunting colobus monkeys was only possible through the efforts of hedwige and christophe boesch who had spent five years studying the apes in the ivory coast forests of west africa meanwhile a bivouac of army ants in panama was able to be filmed internally with the aid of a medical endoscope furthermore a new type of camera lens enabled tree ants to be filmed in enlarged close up just in front of attenborough with both subjects in sharp focus this gave the illusion that the insects were much larger than their actual size filming critical moments in the life of a herd of elephants necessitated the expertise of cynthia moss who had devoted 25 years to researching the animals in kenya she was able to advise the production team on the right moments to film specific events the camera team had only one chance to film a 60 000 strong flock of waders flying over david attenborough s head in norfolk and the rspb was enlisted to predict their flightpath by contrast the florida scrub jays couldn t have been more co operative since the particular group being filmed had been studied closely and were used to humans a bird could land on attenborough s hand right on cue the inside of a termite mound proved especially challenging for attenborough it was so cramped that he could only face in one direction he therefore had to slowly crawl backwards out of shot when performing re takes behaviour seen for the first time included the sequence that was eventually selected to illustrate the series dvd cover that of a killer whale pouncing on a colony of sea lions on a patagonian beach and playing with its young prey before consuming it this meant some risks being taken by the cameramen as they placed themselves in the water just feet away from the creatures in order to obtain close ups of an attack run episodes the savage rocky shores of christmas island 200 miles south of java in the indian ocean it s november the moon is in its third quarter and the sun is just setting and in a few hours from now on this very shore a thousand million lives will be launched 1 arriving broadcast 4 october 1990 the first episode examines the various methods by which creatures come into the world attenborough s opening statement alludes to the annual spawning of the christmas island red crab of which there are estimated to be some 120 million the exercise is all the more hazardous since the species is a land crab and the eggs have to be deposited in the sea where the most ancient animals on the planet still live and breed one of the most prolific aquatic egg producers is the giant clam but some land animals also lay vast quantities and the mantis is one example in the western united states attenborough observes a wasp that digs a burrow conceals it and stocks it with fresh caterpillars for her emerging young the grubs of another start life inside caterpillars and eat the unsuspecting hosts the problems of larger animals are illustrated by snow geese in the arctic which have to defend their eggs from arctic foxes the process of embryonic growth inside the egg from laying to hatching is shown in detail the malleefowl warms its eggs with rotting leaves and attenborough demonstrates the care with which it regulates them by adding sand to its mound to have it kicked back in his face the sea louse is a crustacean that commits suicide its grubs consume so much of the mother s energies that she dies after birth mammals shown giving birth to fully formed young include wildebeest antelope sea lions and chinchillas 2 growing up broadcast 11 october 1990 this programme describes the ways that various species care for their young attenborough defines childhood as achieving two tasks growing and surviving he highlights the elephant seal as an animal that experiences a compressed childhood being abandoned after three weeks and left for up to another eight alone while it becomes large enough to be able to swim for terns there is safety in numbers as the dense population works together to drive out marauding gulls the snow geese in the russian arctic show intense devotion as they escort their goslings by foot to the coast some 50 kilometres away scorpions carry their young on their backs while a shrew will leave hers under a stone while she goes to feed the eider duck is one creature that shares responsibility for its offspring females regularly supervise the ducklings of others in a group the mara is another that uses a crèche system as does the bat whose nurseries can be up to a million strong the florida scrub jay has developed complex parental relationships using teams rather than pairs such behaviour is exhibited on a larger scale by elephants where all females take an interest in raising a single calf a chimpanzee s childhood is socially complicated as an individual must learn how to behave towards others as well as master the use of tools albatrosses must be accomplished fliers as soon as possible chicks are shown being hunted by tiger sharks 3 finding food broadcast 18 october 1990 the next instalment is devoted to the ways in which animals gather their sustenance attenborough begins in the south american rainforest where the proliferation of animal and plant life does not necessarily make it easy to find food some leaves are poisonous and so those that eat them have to be careful other plants use food or nectar as a bribe to get their pollen transported and several species of hummingbird have developed exclusive relationships with certain of them fruit is also on offer again as a means of reproduction and creatures such as squirrel monkeys eat little else meanwhile parrots and macaws take kaolin as an antidote to their diet of toxic seeds attenborough witnesses a 60 000 strong flock of knot and dunlin suddenly take advantage of a low tide to feed on tiny mud dwelling molluscs barracuda hunt small fish and drive shoals of them into bays to be eaten by pelicans which are besieged by gulls that attempt to steal their catches one species of gecko is able to differentiate between worker termites and the more dangerous soldiers the web of the orb spider is hailed as one of the most elegant food catching devices and the methods of two others nephila and its kleptoparasite visitor argyrodes are explored in detail finally tropicbirds their crops full with food en route back to their nests are ambushed in mid air by a group of frigatebirds whose aim is to make them surrender their cargo 4 hunting and escaping broadcast 25 october 1990 this episode looks at those that hunt other creatures and ways of avoiding capture attenborough is attacked by a pair of skuas as he approaches their nest which demonstrates this particular bird s aggressive behaviour both when taking food and defending its young off the shores of patagonia the same group of killer whales returns each year to ambush sea lion pups which stray out of the safer shallow waters having grabbed their prey they take it back out to sea and play with it for some time before killing it poison can be used both as a weapon and a deterrent such as by the viper and tomato frog respectively some animals advertise their defensive measures in advance in case deployment occurs too late among them are the skunk which discharges an appalling smell and some salamanders that display their toxicity by remaining stationary with their warning markings visible several species of stick insect and their elaborate camouflage are shown however none of these methods of protection pose problems to army ants which can subdue any of their prey simply by virtue of their size and vast numbers the harris hawk is unusual since it hunts in teams and a group of six are shown practising their skill in the desert of new mexico the final sequence depicts a troop of chimpanzees displaying strategy and co ordination as it successfully pursues colobus monkeys through a forest in the ivory coast 5 finding the way broadcast 1 november 1990 this programme explores forms of navigation attenborough starts in africa at dusk by describing some of the species that don t rely on sight the spotted hyena uses its acute sense of smell to guide it while it hunts nocturnally while galagos urinate on their hands so they can completely mark their movements some animals use echolocation and these include swiftlets bats and river dolphins by contrast electric eels use fields of electricity to sense their environment during the hours of daylight other methods are employed the rufous elephant shrew with its carefully cleared network of pathways has a sharp mental picture of its habitat even knowing the various shortcuts with which to evade capture attenborough visits the sahara to illustrate a species that makes the longest overland journey of any insect cataglyphis an ant that uses the sun s position to enable it to return to its nest in a straight line lobsters in the bahamas are shown marching in columns to escape stormy waters in its search for perpetual daylight in which to fish the arctic tern makes a 19 000 kilometre journey from one end of the earth to the other the albatross is highlighted as one of the most skilled navigators it can travel up to 1300 kilometres over sea in search of food for its chicks and still find its way back to the nest finally attenborough stands on a waterfall in ireland to tell of the three year 10 000 kilometre journey made by elvers 6 home making broadcast 8 november 1990 this instalment deals with how animals construct their shelters from the elements and predators burrows and holes can provide considerable refuge and attenborough inspects the home of the american prairie dog an elaborate construction that has its own air conditioning system silk is such a valuable commodity that those that can t make it steal it instead the hermit hummingbird uses it to attach its nest to the underside of a leaf while the indian tailorbird stitches two leaves together however the expert in complex nest building is the weaverbird which makes its abode from over 1 000 strips of grass that are perfectly interwoven and dismantling it if it fails to attract a mate the beaver is responsible for one of the biggest animal dwellings its wooden lodge that rises from the river bed stays in place from one generation to the next and so requires constant maintenance some stingless bees use their wax and the resin of tree bark to create labyrinthine structures containing various compartments mud is also used by several creatures such as the potter wasp and the cliff swallow the termites intricate creations allow for security heating air conditioning self contained nurseries and gardens and sanitation systems attenborough hails the species as the consummate home maker and explores a 15 foot colony in west africa that contains 1 5 million insects he crawls right inside to examine its method of ventilation 7 living together broadcast 15 november 1990 this episode focuses on those species that co operate and depend on or exploit others spotted deer follow langur monkeys as they travel from tree to tree eating any leaves that get dropped from above in return the deer serve as a lookout when the primates are feeding on the ground underwater a hermit crab is shown adding sea anemones to its shell in order to protect itself from attack by an octopus and a goby assists a virtually blind shrimp fleas lice and mites are parasites they share no mutual partnership and instead take advantage of creatures for food or shelter however parasites have their predators and an example are the finches of the galápagos islands that clear the resident giant tortoises of their ticks and oxpeckers which do the same for giraffes in africa and even use its fur to line their nests some fish regularly clean others and wrasse and shrimp appear to specialise in this regard as do remora which permanently hang on to their hosts one parasite that grows inside its host is the fluke and one is shown gestating inside a snail having previously been unknowingly eaten because it needs to transfer to a bird s gut to develop further it causes the snail to advertise its presence to allow itself to be consumed thus completing the circle however some microscopic creatures inhabit the stomachs of large herbivores in order to break down the cellulose of their diet thereby aiding their digestion 8 fighting broadcast 22 november 1990 this programme details how fighting both physical and psychological is used for food land or to gain a mate territorial conflict is demonstrated by the hummingbird and attenborough illustrates its aggressiveness by placing a stuffed specimen nearby only to have it speared by its opponent s bill the midas cichlid on the other hand has no weapons to speak of and so uses its mouth to hold on for trials of strength by contrast the forelegs of a mantis shrimp are powerful enough to crack the shell of another crustacean therefore disputes or courtship are fraught with danger animals that possess lethal food gathering weapons usually don t use them against one another as neither side wishes to risk death for example one venomous snake will aim to floor the other rather than bite wolves and big cats largely use snarls and body posture to convey their threat there are no holds barred between rival zebras kicking and biting is employed until a victor emerges whereas giraffes slam their necks against each other normally peacable mountain gorillas are shown squabbling when play gets out of hand and one of them communicates real fright by urinating uncontrollably large herbivores that have horns or antlers are naturally inclined to use them to assert their dominance over the females in a herd duelling male ibex and alaskan bull moose undergo some of the most ferocious engagements sometimes to the death 9 friends and rivals broadcast 29 november 1990 this instalment investigates the ways in which those animals that live in social groups interact with each other the solitary eagle is contrasted with whooper swans landing in scotland after a 1 600 kilometre journey from iceland once arrived they must battle for territory with those already there and pairs or families are usually victorious attenborough uses a group of farmyard chickens to demonstrate a pecking order a pride of lions is shown co operating to subdue a buffalo afterwards each animal peacefully awaits its turn at the carcass baboons live in troops of up to 150 and their complex dominance hierarchy is examined in detail vampire bats display mutual assistance by regurgitating blood for any neighbour that has missed out on a night s feeding dwarf mongooses live in family groups of around a dozen while some look for food or sleep others are always posted on the lookout for predators and quickly raise the alarm if necessary meanwhile some of the most extreme co operation is demonstrated by the underground naked mole rat whose 80 strong clusters are divided into workers who tunnel perpetually soldiers who only act when danger threatens and a single queen for breeding leafcutter ants are shown transporting their food deep below ground it has to be planted in a special fungus to remove its indigestible cellulose and each stage of the operation is carried out by a different caste of individuals 10 talking to strangers broadcast 6 december 1990 this episode concentrates on communication in kenya attenborough accompanies a tribesman who calls to a honeyguide which in turn answers him and leads the pair to a bees nest the tribesman extracts the honey and some is left to reward the bird african hunting dogs are shown hunting gazelles of which the target is the individual that leaps lowest larks evade merlin by sending a similar message by continuing to sing while being chased it tells the pursuer that its prey is fit and therefore will be difficult to catch in 80 of cases this turns out to be true vervet monkeys cries are among the most complex their utterances are effectively words a vocabulary that defines each of their predators so an alarm call is specific to a particular threat some creatures transmit their presence by display and attenborough observes thousands of fireflies illuminating the darkness sounds travel further underwater and over 200 species of fish use them to communicate in turn sea lions have become adept at sensing their proximity however the most visual aquatic animal is the squid which uses colour change and posture to communicate finally attenborough swims with dolphins they converse with a series of ultrasonic clicks and each has a family call inherited from its mother effectively a surname they also use normal sound body posture and touch in short in terms of ability to communicate they are man s closest rival 11 courting broadcast 13 december 1990 this programme surveys the methods employed in attracting a mate mainly those of birds the indian florican inhabits long grass and so is difficult to see in order to gain attention it trampolines in the same spot for up to 400 times a day whales sing to their prospective partners and the female s calls can be heard by suitors for over eight kilometres when animals send out signals of attraction they must also ensure that they don t entice the wrong species and so have markings that differ prominently attenborough highlights the booby as an example there are around half a dozen species all of which may occupy the same island however the blue footed booby reassures its chosen mate by continually lifting its feet tropicbirds and marsh harriers are shown providing graceful aerobatic displays while the sac winged bat uses a strong perfume to lure a companion among those birds that produce the most spectacular visual displays are the lyrebird which also has an elaborate song the peacock and the riflebird and indeed most other birds of paradise the bowerbird invites potential partners to inspect its bower a specially prepared area that contains a hut or walkway augmented by strikingly coloured objects the intricate dances performed by manakins in trinidad are also examined finally attenborough observes the topi s display courts whose sharply defined boundaries are jealously guarded by rival males 12 continuing the line broadcast 20 december 1990 the final instalment illustrates how species fulfil their ultimate raison d être and ensure that their genes are passed on to the next generation it is a universal problem but one which has given rise to a variety of solutions barnacles cannot move but each has both male and female sex cells allowing each neighbour to be a potential mate on the other end of the scale a female elephant undergoes a long pregnancy 22 months and so wishes to ensure that her calf is fathered by a strong and proven male she is therefore very choosy about her partner a female chinchilla is even more so and rejects an unwanted suitor by squirting urine in its face mating is a dangerous business when weapons are involved and a male tarantula approaches his intended with trepidation only when he succeeds in holding off her poison fangs is he able to progress any further for some the right moments to get together are few and far between a male crab for example must wait until a female moults her shell before he is able to fertilise her male sea lions are shown fighting over a harem and some use the battle to their advantage by making off with reluctant females attenborough observes that the monogamous relationships enjoyed by humans are rare within the animal kingdom but he highlights the royal albatross as a beautiful exception the pair of birds featured met as five year olds and have been together for twenty years if you watch animals objectively for any length of time you re driven to the conclusion that their main aim in life is to pass on their genes to the next generation most do so directly by breeding in the few examples that don t do so by design they do it indirectly by helping a relative with whom they share a great number of their genes and in as much as the legacy that human beings pass on to the next generation is not only genetic but to a unique degree cultural we do the same so animals and ourselves to continue the line will endure all kinds of hardship overcome all kinds of difficulties and eventually the next generation appears dvd and book the series is

songwriter of black label society and guitarist for ozzy osbourne wylde has also fronted the southern rock band pride glory as well as releasing the more acoustic oriented album book of shadows under his own stage name career wylde started playing the guitar at the age of 15 and used to work at silverton music in silverton new jersey he grew up in jackson and went to jackson memorial highschool where he graduated from in 1985 he practiced guitar as much as 12 hours per day often he would play the guitar almost non stop between coming home from school and leaving for school the next morning he would then sleep through the school day growing up wylde played locally with his first band called stone henge then later with local jersey band zyris years later a virtually unknown 20 year old wylde landed the coveted role as lead guitarist and co writer for ozzy osbourne he sent ozzy a demo tape in 1987 and was hired to replace the departed jake e lee jake had replaced the deceased randy rhoads an idol of wylde s for whom he even built a shrine it is said that wylde at the age of 20 incorrectly stated as being 19 was hired after only one audition wylde s then girlfriend now wife barbaranne heard ozzy was looking for a new guitarist on the howard stern radio show while playing at a local gig a photographer spoke to wylde urging him to audition for ozzy and offered to send a presskit along to osbourne wylde who at the time was working at a local getty gas station decided he had nothing to lose ozzy dismissed the tape among thousands of others as just another randy rhoads clone but a couple weeks later randy castillo ozzy s drummer at the time told him he d found this great guitarist from new jersey wylde recalled how he received a phone call from sharon osbourne thinking it was one of his friends mother telling him there was a ticket for him to fly out and audition for ozzy ozzy soon recognized him from the tape and press kit and hired him as his new guitarist ozzy had run through many hopefuls following lee s departure at his fated audition wylde reminisces that he was hired on the spot even before he started playing when he was still tuning his guitar he first appeared in no rest for the wicked in 1988 with ozzy osbourne in addition to black label society wylde has been part of a southern style blues band called pride glory that released one self titled album before disbanding he has also released an acoustic solo project entitled book of shadows that contained a much different style of music than he had been accustomed to producing in the past again forming wylde s signature technique with even more diversity going from a local nobody to holder of a coveted role in merely a matter of months zakk wylde s guitar playing style is usually characterized by his use of pinch harmonics and wide vibrato his guitar soloing technique is usually characterized by his use of the minor pentatonic scale playing rapid box pattern licks using strict alternate picking creating a very distinctive choppy attack compared to the more fluid playing styles of other rock guitarists another notable feature of wylde s playing is his liberal use of chicken pickin a technique which is usually associated with country music and which is comparatively rarely seen in heavy metal a technique he has picked up from watching albert lee one of his influences he is known for his use of gibson les paul custom model guitars with a unique bulls eye graphic on them a design he used to deliberately differentiate himself visually from randy rhoads who was also frequently identified by his white les paul custom interestingly one of wylde s favorite stage guitars of late is a replica of rhoads flying v the bulls eye paint job was originally supposed to look like the spiral from the movie vertigo but when it came back incorrect from the luthier he liked the result and stuck with it wylde s signature les pauls include a red and flame maple bulls eye model a black and antique white bulls eye model an orange buzz saw model which zakk got the pattern off a zippo lighter and a camo bulls eye model with mother of pearl neck inlays and a green camouflage paint scheme his original bulls eye les paul was bought from a regular store front and is christened the grail it was lost to wylde for some time when it fell off the truck as he was coming back from a gig in texas rewards were posted to anyone that had information about the guitar it holds sentimental value to him since it was a gift from his parents wylde and the grail were only reunited years later after a fan bought it at a pawn shop and realized he may very well have the missing guitar after checking the initials z w on its back and the serial number marked on the headstock he then contacted wylde s webmaster to arrange its return ozzy has always left the option open to his band members to leave if they wish but wylde has stayed faithfully by ozzy s side ever since he was a teenager wylde has also in the past auditioned and was poised to become part of guns n roses but a miscommunication between management led to wylde never having the opportunity to play with axl rose wylde has stated that he has no respect for musicians who release material not true to themselves as a consequence the band limp bizkit and their frontman fred durst are regularly ridiculed during black label society s live events on january 17 2006 zakk wylde was immortalized at the hollywood rock walk of fame located at 7425 sunset blvd featuring his hand prints and signature

 id=5904729 title patristic anthology nonfiltered 1225 processed 1210 dbindex 1481237 a patristic anthology commonly called a florilegium is a systematic collections of excerpts more or less copious from the works of the church fathers and other ecclesiastical writers of the early period compiled with a view to serve dogmatic or ethical purposes these encyclopedic compilations are a characteristic product of the later byzantine theological school and form a very considerable branch of the extensive literature of the greek catenæ two classes of christian florilegia may here be distinguished the dogmatic and the ascetical or ethical the dogmatic florilegia are collections of patristic citations designed to exhibit the continuous and connected teaching of the fathers on some specific doctrine the first impulse to compilations of this nature was given by the christological controversies that convulsed the eastern church during the fifth century when both at the gatherings of the great church councils and in private circles the practical need had made itself definitely felt of having at hand for ready reference a convenient summary of what the fathers and most approved theologians had held and taught concerning certain controversial doctrines such a summary setting forth the views of nestorius and the mind of the orthodox fathers was first laid before the council of ephesus in 431 by st cyril of alexandria summaries of dogmatic utterances were used also at the council of chalcedon in 451 and at the fifth general council in 533 only in the seventh century the dogmatic florilegia assumed a fully developed and definite form at the sixth general council in 680 two of these collections played a very prominent rôle one constructed by macarius the patriarch of antioch in favour of the monothelites and the other a counter collection presented by the legates of pope agatho during the iconoclastic controversy similar collections were produced mention is made of one on the cult of relics and images which the synod of jerusalem sent to john bishop of gothia about 760 the oldest extant and at the same time most extensive and valuable of these dogmatic compilations is the antiquorum patrum doctrino de verbi incarnatione first completely edited from a manuscript in the vatican library by f diekamp doctrina patrum de incarnatione verbi ein griechisches florilegium aus der wende des 7 und 8 jahrhunderts münster 1907 it is extraordinarily rich in fragments from writings of the patristic period which are now lost of the 977 citations mainly of a christological character which it contains 751 alone are from the works of the fathers representing 93 ecclesiastical writers diekamp ascribes the work to the period between the years 685 and 726 and though nothing can be said with certainty concerning the author a slight probability points to anastasius of sinai as its compiler a florilegium somewhat similar to the doctrina is mentioned by photius in his bibliotheca migne p g cliii 1089 92 but not a trace of it survives to day another compilation of this kind covering the whole province of theology in five books is ascribed to the monk doxopatres identical perhaps with the eleventh century john doxopatres the first two books treating of adam and christ are all that remain a number of other dogmatic florilegia are still extant in manuscript form but they have never been edited nor even critically examined the authors of most of them are unknown the ascetical florilegia are collections of moral sentences and excerpts drawn partly from the scriptures and partly from the fathers on such topics as virtues and vices duties and exercises of a religious life faith discipline etc they are not so numerous as the dogmatic florilegia and apparently were all compiled before the tenth century their material as a rule is gathered indiscriminately from various authorities though in some instances it is furnished by only a single writer a distinct preference being then shown for the works of the more illustrious fathers basil the great gregory of nazianzus and st john chrysostom an extensive christian florilegium of the sixth century entitled tà ierá sacred things is probably the earliest of these anthologies the work consisted originally of three books the first of which treated of god the second of man and the third of the virtues and vices in the course of time it underwent contraction into one book its material was recast and arranged in alphabetical order under títloi or sections its name changed to tà ierà parállela sacra parallela from the fact that in the third book a virtue and a vice were regularly contrasted or paralleled and its authorship widely ascribed to st john damascene that the damascene was really the compiler of the sacra parallela and that he used as his principal source the capita theologica a florilegium of maximus confessor has been maintained firmly against loofs wendland and cohn by k holl fragmenta vornicänischer kirchenväter aus den sacra parallela leipzig 1899 though tà ierá is no longer extant in its original form considerable portions of the first two books have come down to us in manuscript and parts of the third are preserved in the bee melissa of antonius a greek monk of the eleventh century migne p g cxxxvi 765 1124 of the sacra parallela there are several recensions one of which is given in migne p g xcv 1040 1586 xcvi 9 544 other extant ascetical florilegia still remain unedited as in the case of the dogmatic florilegia most of them are anonymous the character and value of the christian florilegia cannot be definitely or finally estimated until the various manuscripts that now lie scattered through the libraries of europe and the east have received a more thorough and critical investigation than has hitherto been accorded to them questions as to date authorship sources structure relative dependence etc have as yet been treated only in a general way as the characteristic production of an age of theological decadence these collections of ancient christian fragments have no high literary value they are however of great importance to us because they frequently embody the only remains of important patristic writings the difficulties connected with their uses arise chiefly from the unsatisfactory condition of the text the uncertainty concerning the names to which the fragments have been ascribed and the want of sufficient data to determine the dates only a small part of the extant material has been printed source

arts which taught drawing skills free of charge to the sons of families from the lowest classes of society the aim was both to train artisans and artists so as to improve the quality of the parisian

austria the pope consulted him on the best way to organize police services in their states he had agents and spies everywhere in the city and abroad including as far away as in america and in india such was his reputation that foreign governments often required his help in searching for fugitives once a minister of maria theresa wrote to sartine asking him to arrest a famous thief who was thought to be hiding in paris sartine replied to the minister that the thief was actually in vienna and gave the minister the street address where the thief was hiding as well as a description of the thief s disguise sartine personally analyzed an enormous correspondence and received his subordinates and commissioners of police anytime of day and night he was the first to use repentant thieves and reprieved convicts as informants and agents to courtiers who found this shocking he used to say pray tell me the name of honest people who would like to do such a job sartine was also a man of action with great presence of mind on one occasion having to quell a riot on the place maubert he met the crowd at the head of a company of musketeers and had an officer respectfully remove his hat and tell the crowd gentlemen we come here in the name of the king but our orders are to shoot at the scoundrels only i therefore pray the honest people to leave the square the crowd disbanded without a gunshot although admired by his contemporaries he was also criticized for using his highly efficient secret police to spy not only on criminals but also on ordinary citizens his services opened private letters sent through the mail which was a frequent practice in europe at the time and spied on families sartine was thus aware of all sorts of scandals in the city notably sexual scandals and he sent daily reports to the king containing saucy and intimate details about courtiers clerics and private citizens which were said to amuse the king and relieve him from the boredom of court life furthermore his political police was known for its efficiency in detecting agitators dissenters anticlerical propagandists and other people perceived as trouble makers who were imprisoned without trial through the lettres de cachet some sources say that there were never more political prisoners at the bastille and at the fortress of vincennes than under his tenure in parallel with his career as lieutenant general of police of paris antoine de sartine became maître des requêtes in december 1759 and conseiller d état in 1767 he was the director of the library from 1763 to 1774 succeeding

the book trade and the press like his friend malesherbes he was a liberal and supported the philosophers of the enlightenment in particular diderot and his encyclopédie which he protected against the attacks of the ecclesiastical party antoine de sartine was close to the party of the minister choiseul who had been disgraced by louis xv in 1770 and ordered to retire to his estate after the king s death in may 1774 choiseul was allowed to return to paris and his party regained favor at court thus on august 24 of the same year sartine was appointed secretary of state for the navy with the honorific rank of minister of state in 1775 and left his office of lieutenant general of police to his protégé lenoir secretary of state for the navy antoine de sartine inherited a strong french navy resurrected by choiseul after the disasters of the seven years war when france lost canada louisiana and india and which would later defeat the british navy in the war of american independence in the ministry sartine surrounded himself with able men such as the comte de fleurieu he modernized and rationalized the french navy by seven decrees september 27 1776 he gave naval officers the high hand over french ports and naval dockyards which were put under the direction of the comte de fleurieu he also reorganized the corps of naval artillery and marine infantry in 1775 after the aborted attempt

aristocracy as conflict with england was looming on the horizon he increased shipbuilding budgets fourfold enabling large scale shipbuilding when france entered the american war of independence in the

commissioned the construction of dry docks in brest rochefort lorient and toulon particularly interested in foundries he created the naval foundry of indret near nantes now a unit of dcn specialized in conventional and nuclear propulsion in these critical times he fought successfully against insubordination in the navy notably by publishing a regulation in 1780 dealing with hygiene onboard the vessels of the fleet and with marine crew health issues drawing from his police experience he also used his spy network in the fight against england the budget deficit which was aggravated by france s participation in the war of american independence led to conflict between the finance minister necker who sought to limit expenditures and sartine who wanted to expand the french navy even further necker accused sartine of exceeding the budget allocated to the navy by 20 million livres approx us 100 million in 2006 necker complained sharply to king louis xvi that this overrun threatened an already almost bankrupt state eventually the king dismissed sartine on october 14 1780 and replaced him with the marquis de castries sartine however was dismissed with honors he received a reward of 150 000 livres approx us 700 000 for his services and he was granted a 70 000 livres yearly pension antoine de sartine tried to justify his actions as minister in a vitriolic pamphlet against necker whom he accused of having sold himself to the english but he didn t win over the public and was the victim of numerous puns and epigrams such as this one i swept paris with extreme care and wishing to sweep the english from the seas i sold my broom so dearly that i was swept away myself later years sartine lived in retirement in paris until the start of the french revolution hated by the revolutionary crowds for his tenure as lieutenant general of police and his use of the lettres de cachet to imprison people without trial attacked by manuel in his la police de paris dévoilée the paris police uncovered he decided to leave france shortly after the storming of the bastille on july 14 1789 which probably saved his life his son charles marie antoine de sartine born in 1760 who was maître des requêtes from the age of 20 until 1791 and chose to stay in france was arrested in 1794 sentenced to death by the revolutionary tribunal and guillotined on june 17 of that year along with his 19 year old wife and his mother in law the comtesse de sainte amaranthe sartine took refuge in barcelona where he had spent his childhood there he was active among émigré circles around 1797 he

any being this is supposed to be the place where there is only one soul which is present in the form of lord vishnu this concept of srcm is hypothetical in nature and is generally misleading i e that in brahmaloka any individual soul can reside in the form they were present on this earth this concept itself deviates from the original view of brahmaloka according to hindu philosophy and which can be used to manipulate the public for reference kindly see complete works of swami vivekanda vol 2 chapter cosmos see discussion page for further research sites on brahmaloka samskaras these are the grossness of attachment desire and fear which separate human beings from their divine nature they are seen to be the root cause of all experiences including both suffering and joy fundamental to the philosophy of sahaj marg is the concept of cleaning whereby samskaras are removed facilitating spiritual progress this concept which is used in srcmtm is the most misleading and this is what causes its adherents to become according to some more and more ignorant and negligent of their family and societal responsibilities if we try and understand the premise the theory of karma we will come to the conclusion that it is not possible for one not to pay for his her deeds this is the basic law of nature action and reaction and this is what is explained in detail in karma yoga according to karma yoga all good deeds will bring results in the form of bliss and joy and all bad deeds will return in the form of pain and the theory goes no one can save him herself from the effects of their karma according to this concept if a person has done some good and though living isolated in a forest he she will experience pleasure and if a person has done bad he will undergo pain there is no escaping from this law if a person causes pain to anyone it will ultimately come back all actions thoughts deeds and view s ultimately return back to the originator this is the law of nature and no one can remain unaffected by his her actions ref complete works of swami vivekananda vol 1 karma yoga in case of srcm we find that it is claimed that the effects of one s deeds can be erased which is in contradiction to the law of karma whereas all the enlightened personalities of the past like swami vivekananda gautama buddha lord krishan have all said that one cannot escape from one s deeds see references teachings from the sahaj marg material its adherents see it as a natural simple heart based approach to realizing the presence of the divine within their lives the shri ram chandra mission is the main proponent of the sahaj marg system sahaj marg is a remodeled and modified version of raja yoga yoga of the mind simplified to suit and help the man of present day world to achieve the same inner perfection as the master which according to sahah marg is a synonym for god realization it is a non renunciate form of raja yoga the renunciation renouncing the material world of raja yoga having been replaced by detachment detachment from the material world and attachment to the divine adherents will note that the austerities tapas and the yamas with regards to the non receiving of any gifts as described by swami vivekananda are not part of sahaj marg complete works of swami vivekananda see references the mind is the key instrument in a human being and by proper regulation of mind through meditation under practical guidance and support of a spiritual master who erases one s samskaras imprints on the soul by our past thoughts or actions one can evolve to the highest that the master has attained the master transmits to the disciple directly or through a preceptor that the disciple sees once a week in a private sitting there is also one or two group sittings and reading of master s material every week there is a suggested daily practice which involves a daily meditation a daily cleansing a weekly private sitting with a preceptor and one or two group sittings per week there are gatherings on the birthdays of the masters some abhyasis organize discussions of the guru s writings reading of the master s writings is suggested vegetarianism is encouraged sahaj marg claims to be a non monastic movement those who adhere to the practices are referred to as abhyasis a preceptor is an abhyasi who has been prepared and permitted by the master to introduce people to the sahaj marg system and conduct group meditation sahaj marg says that adherents of all religions are welcome and do not have to reject their religion to practice sahaj marg the practice of sahaj marg is free of charge and there are three meditations together with a trained preceptor for the starting of the practice there are no physical impedments to leaving the practice on other religions on other religions sahaj marg claims to erase samskaras imprint on the soul the current master chariji stated that abhyasis were lucky if they were in religion he said they would have to go to church and you know tell lies in that wonderful place called the confessional lord forgive me for what i have done this week and there would be an equally sinful priest on the other side of the curtain saying in the name of the lord jesus christ i absolve you of your sins something that according to chariji he has no power to do no man on earth has power he states to absolve you of your sins except two people one oneself and the other god in between there is nobody who can do it he stated then he added that is why religion is useless that is why religion has failed that s why the master stated the abhyasis are all there not in church speech reverence respect restraint denmark nov 2005 see references and later chariji stated that he was no christ you know to crucify himself on the cross for all of them did they think christ was a wise man he asked that he christ became crucified so that forever and ever after humanity would be absolved of its sins i don t think so he said it gave people more license for indulgence but after all he said they have been forgiven two thousand years ago for what they are going to do today what their children were going to do ten years hence he said that he did not think he christ was wise according to chariji he christ left no room no incentive for human beings to change become moral become spiritual he said that they were all happy that they had a christ who got crucified he added that none of us weep for christ and that we were happy god bless him we say which is another blasphemy he then said that the abhyasis need blessings not christ speech reverence respect restraint denmark nov 2005 see references at a preceptors seminar in january 2001 chariji stated in the indian scene the hindus and hinduism is corrupt god is personified as somebody who can be bribed with gifts with so called prasads offering temptation of heaven which fact babuji emphasized in his teachings saying that religions depends on two instruments temptation and fear i am afraid that sahaj marg is suffering in this way because even when christian people become abhyasis and preceptors they somehow somewhere along the way seem to lose this idea of love charity compassion faith and become preceptors so what spirituality offers and can deliver our priesthood i would categorize you as say temporarily as priesthood they destroy speech preceptor s seminar jan 2001 see references written in the sahaj marg material abhyasi s question why do i have to give up my existing religious practices master s answer all religious practice involve the worship of god as being outside us it is called bahya upachara in sanskrit spirituality puts god where he really is inside the human heart and indeed at the heart of every created thing as lord krishna says in the bhagavad gita one cannot mix the two in the vedas murthy pooja is called the lowest form of worship mantra is only a way of pleasing the mind and bhajans please the senses while giving the illusion of being a form of worship

the world propagated by itself why two sexes he questioned apparently not so that one sex should marry among themselves according to sahaj marg masters so what the church may allow i don t have to condone or accept he said not mentionning what churches condones or performs same sex marriages to me chariji said it is a very blatant misuse of so called privileges of the human being fundamental

master expressly forbid idol worship to abhyasis the preceptor apparently becomes such an idol the author states i believe that any abhyasi who says my preceptor when talking about the preceptor who is serving him has fallen into this form of idol worship i seems there is concern that the preceptor can be transformed into an idol or idolised the author follows here again the master may be in the background but is that master s rightful place so master s message is quite clear all credit goes to our master when we give credit where it is not due that too is a form of idol worship we should beware of falling into such errors salient features of sahaj marg smri series 3 page 52 53 see references on donations on donations the abhyasis is to think that it is their mission it is their master

because any organisation including a democracy has the power of accepting or rejecting we can t say it is a free organisation yes or no he asked no he replied chariji claimed that sahaj marg has no

presented by the government of zulfqar ali bhutto of the pakistan s people party in 1970 shaykh muhammad karam shah began publishing the ziya i haram monthly which is primarily a journal of islamic studies that presents articles and essays related to academia shaykh muhammad karam shah regularly and with much passion used to write the editorial of this journal providing guidance to the common muslim in relation to current affairs this editorial was titled sirre dilbaran the secret of the leaders the editorial of this journal is headed with the same title even today due to his views on many occasions he was heavily criticised by various circles when he included secular subjects in his curriculum he was criticised by his contemporaries when he stood up for fundamental islamic viewpoints he was criticised by politicians who wanted scholars to avoid this area and stay within their mosques he wanted politicians to understand the values and principles of islam and implement them in pakistan moreover he wanted muslim scholars to realise the circumstances and challenges they face in the modern world on a few occasions he paid a price for his stance due to his strong opposition to zulfqar ali bhutto s government he was imprisoned for three months and his monthly journal was placed under the regulations of press censorship following the events of 1977 and the nizam mustafa movement general zia ul haq chief of the pakistani army took over the presidency by a military coup and dismissed bhutto s government general zia ul haq seemed to desire the islamisation of pakistan he found the present judicial system inadequate and thus in 1980 founded the federal shari a court some of the decisions made by the judges in this court caused many outcries and criticisms for example when the federal shari a court announced that the punishment for adultery rajm stoning to death was not an islamic legal punishment this verdict was met with immense opposition from the muslim scholars it is no surprise that at the forefront of these critics was shaykh muhammad karam shah who severely criticised this decision in his monthly editorial due to shaykh muhammad karam shah s

violated in pakistan after three days of continuous deliberations thirteen out of fifteen judges at the commission adjudicated in favour of shaykh muhammad karam shah and declared that the rights of the qadiyanis were in fact not being violated by the pakistanis or the government of pakistan this was a great victory for islam as the followers of ghulam ahmed qadiyani who claimed to be a prophet

 id=44768 title mont blanc nonfiltered 1302 processed 1285 dbindex 1481316 mont blanc french for white mountain or monte bianco italian same meaning also known as la dame blanche french the white lady in the alps 4 808 m 15 774 ft is the highest mountain in western europe the mountain lies between the regions of aosta valley italy and haute savoie france the location of the summit itself is a subject of controversy between the two countries and each tends to place it within its own boundaries on maps in a convention between france and kingdom of sardinia in turin 1861 the border was fixed on the highest point of mont blanc and this was the last official definition of this border but often the french maps do not respect this solution the two most famous towns near mont blanc are chamonix in haute savoie france site of the first winter olympics and courmayeur in the aosta valley in italy begun in 1957 and completed in 1965 the 11 6 km 7 mi mont blanc tunnel runs beneath the mountain between these two cities and is one of the major trans alpine transport routes the mont blanc massif is popular for mountaineering hiking and skiing history first ascents the first recorded ascent of mont blanc was on august 8 1786 by jacques balmat and the doctor michel paccard this climb initiated by horace bénédict de saussure who gave a reward for the successful ascent traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering the first woman to reach the summit was marie paradis in 1808 united states president to be theodore roosevelt also led an expedition reaching the summit while on his honeymoon in 1886 now the summit is ascended by an average 20 000 mountaineer tourists each year and could be considered an easy yet long ascent for someone who is well trained and used to the altitude this impression is reinforced by the fact that from l aiguille du midi where the cable car stops mont blanc seems quite close being merely 1000 m higher however every year the mont blanc massif takes many victims and in peak weekends normally around august the local rescue service flies an average of 12 missions mostly directed towards people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain these are courses that require knowledge of high altitude mountaineering a guide or at least a veteran mountaineer and proper equipment it is a long course that includes delicate passages and the hazard of rock slides also at least one night at the refuge is required to get used to the altitude less could lead to altitude sickness and possible death who owns the summit since the french revolution this question has spurred many debates before this event the whole mountain was in the kingdom of sardinia for several centuries the first treaty to define a border in the region is dated may 15 1796 in this treaty the sardinian king was forced by napoleon to cede savoie and nice s territories to the french republic and in article 4 of this treaty it says the border between the sardinian kingdom and the departements of the french republic will be established on a line determined by the most advanced points on the piedmont side of the summits peaks of mountains and other locations subsequently mentioned as well as the intermediary peaks knowing starting from the point where the borders of faucigny the duchy of aoust and the valais to the extremity of the glaciers or the monts maudits first the peaks or plateaus of the alps to the rising edge of the col mayor this act is even more confusing because it states that the border should be visible from the town of chamonix and courmayeur the summit is not visible from courmayeur because part of the mountain lower down obscures it already inaccurate at the time this treaty is no longer valid because it was replaced by a later legal act this act was signed in turin on march 24 1860 by napoleon iii and victor emmanuel ii of savoy and deals with the annexation of savoie a demarcation agreement signed on march 7 1861 defines the new border one of the prints from the sarde atlas made in 1823 and positions the border exactly on the summital edge of the mountain and measures it to be 4 804 m high the convention of march 7 1861 recognizes this through an attached map but takes into consideration the limits of the massif and draws the border on the icecap of the mont blanc and therefore makes it both french and italian watershed analysis of modern topographic mapping not only places the main summit on the border but also suggests that the border should follow a line northwards from the main summit towards mont maudit leaving the south east ridge to mont blanc de courmayeur wholly within italy despite the fact that the franco italian border was redefined in both 1947 and 1963 the commission made up of both italians and french tactfully ignored the mont blanc issue the vallot cabin the first real scientific investigations on the summit were conducted by the botanist meteorologist joseph vallot at the end of the 19th century he wanted to stay near the top of the summit so he had to build his own permanent cabin the janssen observatory in 1891 pierre janssen a scientific academic envisaged the construction of an observatory at the summit of mont blanc gustave eiffel agreed to take on the project provided he could find strong foundations the swiss surveyor imfeld dug down 15 m but found nothing solid so eiffel gave up despite this the observatory was built in 1893 levers attached to the ice supported the observatory this worked to some extent until 1906 when the building started leaning heavily the movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly but three years later two years after jannsen s death a crevasse started opening under the observatory and it was abandoned eventually the building fell and only the tower could be saved in extremis air crashes the mountain was the scene of two fatal air india air crashes in 1950 and 1966 both planes were approaching geneva airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent 48 and 117 people lost their lives altitude the summit of mont blanc is a thick perennial ice and snow dome whose thickness varies so no exact and permanent summit altitude can be determined but accurate measurements have been made for a long time its official altitude was 4 807 m then in 2002 the ign and expert surveyors with the aid of gps technology measured it to be 4 810 40 m after the 2003 heatwave in europe a team of scientists re measured the height on the 6th and 7th of september the team was made up of the glaciologist luc moreau two surveyors from the gps company three people from the ign seven expert surveyors four mountain guides from chamonix and saint gervais and four students from various institutes in france this team noted that the altitude was 4 808 45 m and the peak was 75 cm away from where it had been in 2002 after these results were published more than 500 points were measured to assess the effects of climate change and the fluctuations in the height of the mountain at different points from then on the altitude of the mountain has been measured every two years the interpretation that the heatwave had caused this fluctuation is disputed because the heatwave is known not to have significantly affected the glaciers above 4000 m the height and position of the summit could have been moved by general glacial forces at this altitude the temperatures rarely rise above 0 c during the summer of 2003 the temperature did rise to 2 c and even 3 c but this would not have been enough for the ice which stayed at 15 c to melt the summit was measured again in 2005 and the results of were published on 16 december 2005 the height was found to be 4 808 75 m 30 cm more than the previous recorded height the actual rock summit is at 4 792 m and is 40 m away from the ice covered summit climbing routes there are a few classic climbing routes of mont blanc the most popular route to climb mont blanc is the voie des cristalliers also known as voie royale starting from saint gervais the tramway du mont blanc tmb is taken to get to the nid d aigle the ascent then begins in the direction of the tête rouge cabin and then through the goûter corridor considered very dangerous because of frequent rock falls leading to goûter cabin for night shelter the next day the route leads to the dôme du goûter the vallot cabin and l arrête des bosses la voie des 3 monts is also known as la traversée starting from chamonix the téléphérique de l aiguille du midi is taken towards the col du midi the cosmiques cabin is used to spend the night the next day the ascent continues through mont blanc du tacul and mont maudit the historic itinerary through the grand mulets which is most frequently traversed in winter by skis or in summer to go down to chamonix the normal italian itinerary is also known as la route des aiguilles grises after crossing the miage glacier the night is spent at the gonella cabin the next day proceeds through the col des aiguilles grises and then the dôme du goûter concluding at l arrête des bosses the miage bionnassay mont blanc crossing is usually done in three days the route begins from contamines montjoie with the night spent in the conscrits cabin the following day the dômes de miages is crossed and the night spent at the durier cabin the third day proceeds through l aiguille de bionnassay and then the dôme du goûter from the summit of mont blanc on a clear day the jura the vosges the black forest and the massif central mountain ranges can be seen as well as the principal summits of the alps exploits in 1886 future us president theodore roosevelt led the third recorded expedition to the peak in 1960 the airplane pilot henri giraud landed on the summit which is only 30 m long in 1990 the swiss pierre andré gobet leaving from chamonix completed the ascent and descent in 5 hours 10 minutes and 14 seconds on may 30 2003 stéphane brosse and pierre gignoux try to beat the record by ski walking they went up in 4 hours and 7 minutes and came back down in 1 hour and 8 minutes in total they did the ascent and descent in 5 hours and 15 minutes on august 13 2003 seven french paragliders landed on the summit they reached a peak altitude of 5 200 m thanks to the hot weather conditions which provided

production this is the 100th episode though i m a little bit country was actually aired as such its production was alluded to in a joke in the episode plot this episode begins in a manner very similar to the first episode cartman gets an anal probe with eric cartman cartman arriving and talking about a dream where he was abducted by aliens when the children realize this they and chef decide to do something about the anal probe cartman has they first see a proctologist then a scientist they discover the satellite dish in cartman s butt is sending off pictures of earth into space then a group of visitors show up and the children and chef flee however the children are ultimately abducted the kids wake up on the ship and meet najix an alien who looks like stan s dad explaining to them that he chose an appearance that would be most pleasing to them the disappointed children say it s like the movie contact which sucked he shows his true form a terrifying monster so the children have him go through a series of transformations mostly of celebrities until cartman suggests a taco that craps ice cream najix then explains he and the other aliens make a reality show called earth which chef and the scientists discover at the same time on earth they proceed to tell everyone which leads the alien network heads to cancel the show and prepare to destroy the earth the boys go to planet fognl to meet the alien heads who are joozians a species that control all media in the universe the aliens don t listen to the boys but insist on taking them to lunch a hekma topless bar then get a prostitute s hotel room the two joozians then very drunk and high on blach begin sucking on each others jagons and sticking their fingers in each others thrushers kenny takes a picture of it and the boys then blackmail the aliens with it the joozians agree to erase everyone s memory of the truth about earth then send the oblivious boys back to their own planet kenny still has the picture and though no one can remember what it is chef tells kenny to keep it as he feels sure it s something very important references to popular culture sounds from the game doom are used in this episode the door open and close sound the movie contact is parodied the alien construction and tearing down of the earth is a reference to douglas adams the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy the opening of the decrypted alien reality tv show resembles the initial opening of star trek the next generation that was only used during the first season the alien chase scene in the first act parodies the archetypal chase scene in the dukes of hazzard a caricature of boss hogg can be seen on a billboard during the chase scene with the words eat big pig s bbq the alien giving chase also impersonates the cackling laugh of sheriff roscoe p coltrane the children wake up aboard the alien ship sealed into cubicles with a slimy substance this is a reference to the alien movies however cartman initially believes that he is stuck inside helen hunt s ass the aliens car is a buick lesabre complete with a mock buick emblem right the plot of the episode also parodies the truman show according to the shape shifting alien each planet has only one species living on it this is a reference to popular science fiction works such as star trek in which each alien species seems to exist on a world without or at least extremely limited additional animal life the saddam hussein form the shapeshifting alien takes on and the song he sings is a parody on a scene right at the end of 1987 s mel brooks spaceballs movie the scientist named jeff trying to help the boys and chef looks like a south park version of jeff goldblum in a reference to independence day when puzzling out alien technology and action jeff goldblum s character follows unlikely chains of thought to come to conclusions that curiously turn out to be exactly correct the clip where people are running scared across a bridge is from the danish monster horror movie reptilicus the joozians the joozians who run the universe s media are parodies of jews and the charge that jews secretly run the media they are shown with stereotypically jewish appearance such as their very large noses use words that sound like hebrew and when kyle who is jewish samples some of their food and likes it the aliens claim that he seems to have joozian ancestry to which cartman replies tell us about it their symbol is a seven pointed star reminiscent of the star of david the joozians congratulate the boys for having their show earth make it to 100 episodes cancelled is however only the 97th episode of south park the true 100th episode is i m a little bit country in which stan s dad tells the viewers it is the 100th episode the joozians says a show should never go past 100 episodes because it then goes into weird stories and settings this is followed by a pause where the joozians are sitting and staring blankly into the camera this is a joke because the show was 3 episodes from its 100th and the episode features a weird plot where earth is actually a tv show for aliens in syndication the reference to the joozians apparent oral sex is

 id=6018331 title great lakes atlantic coast derecho nonfiltered 1311 processed 1294 dbindex 1481325 the great lakes atlantic coast derecho was a series of severe wind events associated with powerful thunderstorms known as derechos that occurred between july 17 and july 21 2006 across a wide swath of north central and northeastern north america stretching from the upper midwest through much of ontario and into the northeastern united states in the latter storms of the period the middle mississippi river valley was affected notably the city of st louis missouri which took a direct hit on sucessive nights by powerful derechos during the period over 3 000 000 people across the region were left without power from the storms early evidence points to a classic progressive derecho that struck parts of northern michigan northeastern ontario and quebec northeastern ontario derecho july 17 2006 the event the derecho originated from a severe thunderstorm that was forming across portions of the upper peninsula and the northernmost parts of the lower peninsula of michigan in the early afternoon hours of july 17 it crossed the north channel into northeastern ontario near sault ste marie where it quickly developed into a derecho line as it crossed manitoulin island just south of sault ste marie in lake huron numerous trees were uprooted and some homes sustained heavy damage an official wind gust of 128 km h 80 mp h was recorded at the killarney weather station on the north shore of lake huron tornado warnings were issued for the area and with the amount of damage reported there may been tornado touchdown s although unconfirmed as yet at about 3 30 4 00 pm edt 1930 2000 utc the storm raced through sudbury toppling hydro poles and trees highway 69 the major highway that links sudbury to toronto had to be shut down because electrical wires blocked the highway at that point the storm system started to take the form of a comma signature of a fast moving progressive derecho at about 5 30 pm edt 2130 utc the storm affected north bay a city of over 50 000 and the surrounding nipissing district numerous trees in the town were levelled and many buildings sustained heavy surface and some structural damage just south of the city radio towers and a lighthouse were also demolished by the violent winds at the nearby airport the wind measuring instrument snapped off before the peak gusts could be recorded some estimates put them higher than 180km h 111 mp h tornado warnings were also in effect for the area and several were reported or funnels observed but none have been confirmed within the district the communities of west nipissing callander east ferris and mattawa all about five hours north of toronto declared states of emergency in the wake of the storm at the same time the storm affected the algonquin park region mostly the northern portion and killed at least one michigan man and injured another also from michigan who were on a canoe trip near kiosk a small community located at the northern end of the park through the next two hours the storm entered the upper ottawa valley affecting places in renfrew county such as barry s bay deep river cobden petawawa and pembroke there were numerous reports of damage particularly blown off or damaged roofs after crossing the pembroke area the derecho started to lose some steam at times the storm moved at a forward speed of 100 120 km h 65 75 mph but had slowed down somewhat when in entered the pontiac region of western quebec also the north south oriented line became more disorganized at its southern end still the storms carried a lot of lightning strikes and damaging wind as it crossed portions of the outaouais region the city of gatineau and extreme northern portions of the city of ottawa primarily closer to the ottawa river at around 9 pm areas such as chelsea cantley la peche notre dame du laus and kazabazua were hard hit spectacular lightning was seen from downtown ottawa and when the storm was close enough some pinkish color could have been seen in the northern sky in the upper gatineau region north of the national capital region several houses had damage and scores of trees were snapped by winds in excess of 90 km h 55 mph five more campers were injured by fallen trees while camping in notre dame du lauswhich was caused by a microburst meanwhile in the maniwaki area a local radio station antenna suffered some extensive damage northwest of that town in grand remous several trailers in a park were heavily damaged or destroyed by the force of the winds but no injuries were reported there additional damage was reported in the papineau region further east as well as in mont laurier and the popular tourist village of mont tremblant in the upper laurentians the cities of ottawa and gatineau were brushed by the storm but escaped the worst of the effects during the rest of the late evening the activity weakened as it travelled through southern quebec and eastern ontario but still contained a fair amount of lightning when it crossed the laurentians north of montreal the following day the remnants of the derecho would re fire over parts of new england including maine but were not as severe as the original cluster aftermath as a result of the storm at least one person died in the algonquin park region while another person was severely injured as a result of fallen tree several other injuries occurred in many areas hit by the storms also two people were briefly missing at the la vérendrye wildlife reserve northwest of maniwaki quebec during the height of the storm hydro one in ontario reported that over 170 000 customers were left without power in the northeast part of the province and the 90 of the city of north bay lost power all of manitoulin island was without power many others areas including the sudbury area and the upper ottawa valley towns of pembroke mattawa and petawawa also had major power outages major outages was also reported in several areas in quebec particularly in the outaouais region 145 000 hydro quebec customers lost power but separate storms in the rouyn noranda val d or montreal trois rivieres and quebec city areas contributed to the some of the outages however if the storms would have move a few kilometres south thus hitting directly populated areas in the city of ottawa and downtown gatineau these numbers would have been much higher and property damage would have been greater final damage assessment from this destructive storm are fully unknown as yet in part because of the remoteness of large portions of the affected area it is also uncertain if there were not more injuries or deaths again due to inaccessibility to parts of the region especially with trees blocking so many remote roads environment canada will investigate areas with heavy damage to ascertain whether tornadoes touched down particularly on the manitoulin island and in larder lake near kirkland lake but at this stage almost all damage reports are straight line in nature and radar imagery also favors a classic progressive derecho storm with winds of up to and possibly exceeding 200 km h 120 mp h at its peak possibly with embedded tornados later that evening a powerful cool front crossed southern ontario causing further storm damage in ontario see below central great lakes upper midwest derecho july 17 2006 while the northern part of the system was producing severe damage only within canada northeast ontario southern quebec an associated cold front led to significant damage in the us midwest and southern ontario as it crossed the area later that evening there were dozens of reports of significant wind and or tornado damage especially in michigan but also in southern ontario wisconsin illinois iowa and as far south as northern missouri the setup was similar along the long cold front and the hot humid air mass led to the damaging derecho although the stronger derecho that affected areas well north of there formed much earlier that day in upper michigan just before noon local time it had a clearly defined bow echo squall line formation unlike these cells which were more fragmented southern ontario sweeping from west to east in the late evening hours the greatest concentration of damage was centred around newmarket scugog lake and the kawartha lakes region further to the east numerous trees and power lines were downed in those areas and one camper was killed when a tree crashed into a camping trailer at the warsaw caves provincial park 30 km 18 miles northeast of peterborough official wind gusts reached 98km h 61 mp h at pearson airport near toronto and 107 km h 66 mp h at peterborough airport heavy storms also crossed essex county in the southwest associated with southward moving line that hit much of lower michigan at least 70 000 people lost power in the south bringing in total at least 300 000 customers who lost power in ontario that day on july 19 2006 environment canada confirmed two tornadoes hit a residential section of newmarket see tornadoes of 2006 article michigan the hardest hit areas appear to be in northern and central lower michigan particularly in and around oceana county several houses were severely damaged and many others suffered varying degrees of damage in addition the oceana county fairgrounds lost at least one of its buildings due to the extreme winds at least one person was injured in the county extensive damage was also reported in benzie county wind speeds of 66 mph 106 km h were recorded in saginaw agricultural damage was severe many grape and cherry crops were heavily damaged or destroyed especially in antrim grand traverse and leelanau counties which will likely have a devastating effect on farmers as the storm took place while they were at maturity stage one person was killed by a lightning strike in the detroit area in michigan over 270 000 people were without power at the storm s peak wisconsin significant wind damage was also reported that afternoon in parts of wisconsin especially the northeastern part around sheboygan high winds knocked out power to at least 12 000 people and even knocked vehicles off interstate 43 winds were officially estimated to be at least 61 mph 97 km h but unofficial readings exceeded 75 mph 120 km h in kohler some thought it was a tornado that hit but it was later confirmed to have been straight line winds like most of the derecho significant damage was also reported in the city of manitowoc where hundreds of trees were blown down city wide knocking out power to hundreds of households winds unofficially reached 60 65mph at the storms peak no injuries were reported in the state illinois more damage was reported in extreme northern illinois along the same line trees and power lines were knocked over all over the northernmost areas some landing on power poles and buildings the extreme heat also compounded the problem forcing emergencies to be declared in several communities over 110 000 people were without power at the peak of the storm in illinois from northern chicagoland to the mississippi river peak wind gusts as high as 70 mph 110 km h were recorded in stephenson some of the hardest hit areas were crystal lake mundelein rockford lake zurich and buffalo grove damage was reported even in the city of chicago particularly on the northwest side numerous houses even lost their roofs as a result of the severe winds several people were injured some of which were due to lightning strikes iowa one tornado touched down at tama along with numerous other hail and high winds reports in the eastern part of the state atlantic coast derecho july 18 2006 the same system refired on july 18 over the northeastern united states it produced similar damage over a large swath of new england and the mid atlantic states the event like the system in ontario but unlike the squall line of the upper midwest this was a continuous series of storms that produced widespread damage along its path the most significant line began in western maryland then tracked north northeastward into southeastern pennsylvania northern new jersey and the northern suburbs of new york city before tracking eastward into southern new england they generally moved in an eastward direction with new cells popping up farther north as old cells dissipated the first cells affected the southernmost part of pennsylvania and western new jersey a new cell took over in northern new jersey crossing southern new york and southern new england tree and power line damage was widespread throughout the entire affected area a few people were injured and several other people barely escaped injuries as a result of trees falling onto houses and cars some of the most spectacular footage came out of providence harbor where a tanker caught in the winds exploded in the harbor while unloading gasoline fortunately it moved away from the dock preventing severe damage in the harbor two people were killed by fallen trees both in chester county pennsylvania no tornadoes were reported in the region aftermath there were hundreds of thousands of people left without power all across the region in the philadelphia area alone over 500 000 people were left without power at the peak of the storm according to peco and pse g many customers will be without power until the weekend at least it took place just after peco had set record highs for electricity usage as a result of the preceding extreme heat wave power crews from as far away as chicago were called in to help restore power after fixing up their damage from the previous day s storms a state of emergency was also declared in bucks county pennsylvania as a result of the storm in northern new jersey about 110 000 people were without power at the peak of the storm in new england the damage was just as severe over 22 000 customers lost power in connecticut at its peak in rhode island that number was 30 000 railroad service was also badly affected with several lines in northern new jersey and southern new york completely blocked by debris and their electric trains disrupted by power outages on several lines the wind graphic from the spc shows an extensive trail of wind damage with over 100 reports in the region st louis upper mississippi river derecho events july 19 21 2006 two powerful derechos about 36 hours apart made direct hits on st louis the first occurred on the evening of july 19 and the second occurred during the mid day hours on july 21 in all 9 storm related deaths were reported with 7 confirmed tornadoes the first storm cut power to over 590 000 customers in the st louis metropolitan area and injured 30 baseball fans at busch stadium ameren reported that it was the worst outage in their 100 year history it also hit an extensive swath of the upper mississippi river valley including sections of illinois a wind gust of 92 mp h 146 km h was recorded in macoupin county also affected were parts of iowa southern wisconsin and southern minnesota the second storm struck after power had been restored to 375 000 customers with 80 mp h winds the storm battered the same areas that had been affected previously ameren estimated that the total number of power outages from both storms exceeded 1 million heatwave the derecho that crossed into ontario and quebec was the result of a warm and very humid airmass that had plagued much of central and eastern canada and the vast majority of the continental u s temperatures in toronto ottawa windsor and montreal were approaching 35 c 95 f for a few days including the day of the storms while heat index values were exceeding well over 40 c 104 f in some areas temperatures hit 100 f 38 c at laguardia airport in new york on july 18th and in st louis missouri on july 19th before storms pummeled those metropolitan areas this heat wave was somewhat similar in structure but less deadly than the 1995 heat wave which had also spawned several destructive derechos across the great lakes near derecho events related to the heat after an initial cooldown period after the mid july storms the intense heat built up again over the great lakes region toward the end of july sparking another series of severe storms other near derecho events occurred on july 31 in eastern ontario august 1 in southern quebec from the upper laurentians to the eastern townships and on august 2 from eastern michigan to southeastern ontario the meteorological conditions were quite similar to the july 17 events however damage was less widespread but there were several dozen tornadoes reported 8 in ontario alone a single day record held since 1985 most of them contained within supercells that struck the

 id=993 title analog signal nonfiltered 1343 processed 1325 dbindex 1481358 an analog or analogue is any variable signal continuous in both time and amplitude it differs from a digital signal in that small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful analog is usually thought of in an electrical context however mechanical pneumatic hydraulic and other systems may also convey analog signals an analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal s information for example an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information electrically the property most commonly used is voltage followed closely by frequency current and charge any information may be conveyed by an analog signal often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena such as sound light temperature position or pressure and is achieved using a transducer for example in an analog sound recording the variation in pressure of a sound striking a microphone creates a corresponding variation in the voltage amplitude of a current passing through it an increase in the volume of the sound causes the fluctuation of the current s voltage amplitude to increase while keeping the same rhythm since most natural data is analog before the digital conversion required to get a digital signal resolution of analog recording and transmitting technology has been higher until recent times for practical reasons such as memory conservation and the cost of phasing out older digital recordings the resolution of some digital signals may remain lower than most analog signals for this reason some audiophiles prefer analog technology however in many cases the difference is too minimal to be noticed disadvantage the primary disadvantage of analog signaling is that any system has noise i e random variation as the signal is copied and re copied or transmitted over long distances these random variations become dominant electrically these losses can be diminished by shielding good connections and several cable types such as coaxial or twisted pair the effects of noise make signal loss and distortion impossible to recover since amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well even if the resolution of an analog signal is higher than a comparable digital signal in many cases the difference is overshadowed by the noise in the signal modulation another method of conveying an analog signal is to use modulation in this some base signal e g a sinusoidal carrier wave has one of its properties modulated amplitude modulation involves altering the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage waveform by the source information frequency modulation changes the frequency other techniques such as changing the phase of the base signal also work analog circuits do not involve quantisation of information into digital format the concept being measured over the circuit whether sound light pressure temperature or an exceeded limit remains from end to end clocks with hands are called analog those that display digits are called digital however many analog clocks are actually digital since the hands do not move in a smooth continuous motion but in small steps every second or half a second or every minute see digital for a discussion of digital vs analog sources some of an earlier version of this article was originally taken from federal standard 1037c in support of mil std 188 see also analog computer analog to digital converter digital to analog converter analog sound vs digital sound analog television analog synthesizer analog photocopier analog transmission analog fax machine attenuation distortion endofarticle doc doc

xiaozhuang and a daughter of the paramount general erzhu rong she later became a concubine of northern wei and eastern wei s paramount general gao huan background erzhu ying e s father erzhu rong had been a hereditary chief of the qihu tribe a branch of the xiongnu located at xiurong in modern shuozhou shanxi and during the agrarian rebellions during emperor xiaoming s reign had become increasingly powerful as a military general sometime during emperor xiaoming s reign she became emperor xiaoming s concubine with the rank of pin she was described to be capable as a soldier and she was able to use the bow well in 528 emperor xiaoming in a dispute with his mother empress dowager hu over her overly favoring her lover zheng yan and zheng s associate xu ge conspired with erzhu rong to have him advance south toward the capital luoyang to force empress dowager hu to remove zheng and xu when empress dowager hu discovered this she poisoned emperor xiaoming to death erzhu rong refused to recognize the young emperor yuan zhao that she put on the throne instead advancing on luoyang capturing it and throwing empress dowager hu and yuan zhao into the yellow river to drown he also slaughtered a large number of imperial officials and made emperor xiaoming s father emperor xuanwu s cousin yuan ziyou emperor as emperor xiaozhuang as empress erzhu rong was in control of the military at this point although emperor xiaozhuang retained substantial powers and erzhu rong wanted emperor xiaozhuang to marry erzhu ying e as empress to cement the relationship emperor xiaozhuang initially hesitated as pursuant to confucian regulations he would be committing incest if he did however the official zu ying convinced him that the union would be advantage and so he agreed empress erzhu was described to be jealous and did not tolerate emperor xiaozhuang s other consorts emperor xiaozhuang once asked her father s cousin erzhu shilong to persuade her to be less jealous instead she told erzhu shilong that emperor xiaozhuang depended on the erzhus for his throne and that things could still change erzhu shilong agreed with her worried about the hold that erzhu rong had on the military and how he had been willing to slaughter imperial officials including emperor xiaozhuang s own brothers yuan shao and yuan zizheng emperor xiaozhuang during empress erzhu s pregnancy in 530 tricked him into entering the palace with his close associate yuan tianmu the prince of shangdang and his son erzhu puti and killing them by falsely telling them that empress erzhu had given birth this precipitated a war between the imperial forces and the erzhus forces which lasted for two months during which empress erzhu gave birth to a son eventually the erzhu forces under the command of empress erzhu s cousin erzhu zhao captured luoyang and deposed and later killed emperor xiaozhuang making his distant relative yuan ye the prince of changguang and then later his cousin yuan gong the prince of guangling emperor erzhu zhao also put emperor xiaozhuang s and empress erzhu s infant son to death as gao huan s concubine the erzhus controlled the empire for a while but in 531 the general gao huan a former subordinate of erzhu rong s rose against them and by 532 gao had defeated the erzhus becoming the paramount general for northern wei and for the branch state eastern wei after northern wei s division into eastern wei and western wei in 534 shortly after gao s defeating of the erzhus she became a concubine of gao s she and another consort that gao took the princess ruru a princess of rouran were renowned for their military demonstrations and gao once commented that these two concubines of his were capable of defeating bandits in 535 when gao huan was angry with his son gao cheng for having had an affair with gao huan s concubine lady zheng he considered replacing his wife lou zhaojun gao cheng s mother with erzhu ying e but ultimately did not do so erzhu ying e bore him two sons gao you later the prince of pengcheng in 533 and gao ning later the prince of huashan in spring 545 erzhu ying e s brother erzhu wenchang and zheng zhongli the brother of gao huan s other favorite concubine zheng dache along with ren zhou conspired to assassinate gao huan and support erzhu wenchang as leader but the conspiracy was discovered and the conspirators were put to death along with their families however because of gao huan s favors for erzhu ying e and zheng dache he spared their brothers however she later became a buddhist nun even while gao huan was still alive for reasons lost to history gao huan built a temple for her after gao huan s death after gao huan s death in 547 and his son gao yang s abolition of eastern wei and establishment of northern qi as its

 id=370648 title soap bubble nonfiltered 1375 processed 1356 dbindex 1481390 a soap bubble is a very thin film of soap water that forms a sphere with an iridescent surface soap bubbles usually last for only a few moments and then burst either on their own or on contact with another object they are often used as a children s plaything but their usage in artistic performances shows that they can be fascinating for adults too soap bubbles can help to solve complex mathematical problems of space as they will always find the smallest surface area between points or edges structure the bubble s skin consists of a thin layer of water trapped between two layers of molecules often soap this surfactant possesses hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails the hydrophilic heads are attracted to the thin water layer and keep the bubble intact when the hydrophobic tails are agitated the bubble pops it may also burst when it hits pointy surfaces physics surface tension and shape a bubble can exist because the surface layer of a liquid usually water has a certain surface tension which causes the layer to behave somewhat like an elastic sheet however a bubble made with a pure liquid alone is not stable and a dissolved surfactant such as soap is needed to stabilize a bubble a common misconception is that soap increases the water s surface tension actually soap does the exact opposite decreasing it to approximately one third the surface tension of pure water soap does not strengthen bubbles it stabilizes them via an action known as the marangoni effect as the soap film stretches the surface concentration of soap decreases which causes the surface tension to increase thus soap selectively strengthens the weakest parts of the bubble and tends to prevent them from stretching further in addition the soap reduces evaporation so the bubbles last longer although this effect is relatively small their spherical shape is also caused by surface tension the tension causes the bubble to form a sphere as a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume this shape can be visibly distorted by air currents and hence by blowing if a bubble is left to sink in still air however it remains very nearly spherical more so for example than the typical cartoon depiction of a raindrop when a sinking body has reached its terminal velocity the drag force acting on it is equal to its weight and since a bubble s weight is much smaller in relation to its size than a raindrop s its shape is distorted much less the surface tension opposing the distortion is similar in the two cases the soap reduces the water s surface tension to approximately one third but it is effectively doubled since the film has an inner and an outer surface freezing soap bubbles blown into air that is below a temperature of 15 c 5 f will freeze when they touch a surface the air inside will gradually diffuse out causing the bubble to crumple under its own weight at temperatures below about 25 c 13 f bubbles will freeze in the air and may shatter when hitting the ground when at this low temperature a bubble is blown with warm breath the bubble will freeze to an almost perfect sphere at first but when the warm air cools and thus is reduced in volume there will be a partial collapse of the bubble a bubble blown successfully at this low temperature will always be rather small in size it will freeze quickly and continuing to blow will shatter the bubble merging when two bubbles merge the same physical principles apply and the bubbles will adopt the dookie shape with the smallest possible dookie surface area their common wall will bulge into the larger bubble as smaller bubbles have a higher internal pressure if the bubbles are of equal size the wall will be flat at a point where two or more bubbles meet they sort themselves out so that only three bubble walls meet along a line since the surface tension is the same in each of the three surfaces the three angles between them must be equal angles of 120 this is the most efficient choice again which is also the reason why the cells of a beehive use the same 120 angle thus forming hexagons only four bubble walls can meet at a point with the lines where triplets of bubble walls meet separated by cos 1 1 3 109 47 interference and reflection the iridescent colours of soap bubbles are caused by interfering light waves and are determined by the thickness of the film they are not the same as rainbow colours but are the same as the colours in an oil slick on a wet road as light impinges on the film some of it is reflected off the outer surface while some of it enters the film and reemerges after being reflected back and forth between the two surfaces the total reflection observed is determined by the interference of all these reflections since each traversal of the film incurs a phase shift proportional to the thickness of the film and inversely proportional to the wavelength the result of the interference depends on these two quantities thus at a given thickness interference is constructive for some wavelengths and destructive for others so that white light impinging on the film is reflected with a hue that changes with thickness a change in colour can be observed while the bubble is thinning due to evaporation thicker walls cancel out red longer wavelengths thus causing a blue green reflection later thinner walls will cancel out yellow leaving blue light then green leaving magenta then blue leaving a golden yellow finally when the bubble s wall becomes much thinner than the wavelength of visible light all the waves in the visible region cancel each other out and no reflection is visible at all when this state is observed the wall is thinner than about 25 nanometres and is probably about to pop this phenomenon is very useful when making or manipulating bubbles as it gives an indication of the bubble s fragility interference effects also depend upon the angle at which the light strikes the film an effect called iridescence so even if the wall of the bubble were of uniform thickness one would still see variations of color due to curvature and or movement however the thickness of the wall is continuously changing as gravity pulls the liquid downwards so bands of colours that move downwards can usually also be observed mathematical properties soap bubbles are also physical illustrations of the problem of minimal surfaces a complex mathematical problem for example while it has been known since 1884 that a spherical soap bubble is the least area way of enclosing a given volume of air a theorem of h a schwarz it was only recently proved in the year 2000 that two merged soap bubbles provide the optimum way of enclosing two given volumes of air with the least surface area this has been termed the double bubble theorem soap films seek to minimise their surface area that is to minimise their surface energy the optimum shape for an isolated bubble is thus a sphere many bubbles packed together in a foam have much more complicated shapes see weaire phelan structure for a discussion of this called the kelvin problem and plateau s laws for a discussion of the structure of the films coloured bubbles adding coloured dye to bubble mixtures fails to produce coloured bubbles because the dye attaches to the water molecules as opposed to the surfactant hence a colourless bubble forms with the dye falling to a point at the base dye chemist dr ram sabnis has developed a lactone dye that sticks to the surfactants thus enabling brightly coloured bubbles to be formed an example of this dye is crystal violet lactone these new bubble mixtures are currently only being sold in the usa under the trade name zubbles how to make soap bubbles the easiest ways are to use commercially produced soap bubble fluid marketed as a toy or to simply put some dishwashing soap in water however this latter might not work as well as expected and there are several tricks to improve the soap suds formula additives something to reduce the water s surface tension such as liquid soap or baby shampoo these may work better the more pure devoid of perfume or other additives the soap is or perhaps with more expensive soaps something to thicken the water most commonly used is glycerin available at the pharmacy which makes the bubbles more colourful too sugar icing sugar or corn syrup have similar effects it may be advantageous to dissolve the sugar in hot water however the soap sud can also be too thick and heavy so it is important not to add too much of these thickening substances distilled water as tap water contains calcium ions and these bind the soap distilled water works better procedure leaving the soap sud in an open container overnight makes it thicker too but again if the solution becomes too heavy it will be harder to make soap bubbles bubbles or foam on the surface of the soap sud should be avoided by stirring gently skimming them away or simply waiting until they are gone how easy it is to make soap bubbles depends on a vast number of factors every soap is different and environmental conditions influence performance too for example dusty air is unfavourable and so is wind also the more humid the air is the better which means making soap bubbles is easier on rainy days altogether the best procedure for finding the perfect solution is the trial and error method history of bubbles as playthings 17th century flemish paintings show children blowing with clay pipes this means that bubbles as playthings are at least 400 years old the london based firm of a f pears created a famous advertisement campaign for its soaps in 1886 using a painting by millais of a child playing with bubbles a chicago company called chemtoy began selling bubble solution in the 1940s and they have captivated children ever since according to one industry estimate retailers sell around 200 million bottles annually perhaps more than any other toy bubble blowers the easiest way is to use either a normal straw or one of the plastic blowers bubble wands that are sold with most commercial soap bubble solutions however as the blower s diameter determines the size of the soap bubble it might be necessary to build a blower bubble wands have been around since the 1920 s most closed ring structures will work a blower can be made by bending a wire into a loop with a handle where the wire should be thick enough so the ring remains stiff it can be improved by wrapping a thread or bandages around the wire so the soap water can stick better to the ring klutz press popularized a giant bubble blower invented by a man named david stein which used a cloth loop attached to a plastic wand with a slide permitting the loop to be gently opened or closed klutz sells bubble books which offer how tos and fun ideas usually with a ready to use bubble loop bubbles can be blown by using a bubble pipe which is made of plastic and usually takes the shape of a smoking pipe sometimes containing multiple bowls the bubble solution is poured into the bowl of the pipe when someone blows into the mouthpiece bubbles rise from the bowl sample

combine entertainment with artistic achievement they require a high degree of skill as well as perfect bubble suds some artists create giant bubbles or tubes often enveloping objects or even humans others manage to create bubbles forming cubes tetrahedra and other shapes or sculptures bubbles are often handled with bare hands one such performer is tom noddy to add to the visual experience they are sometimes filled with smoke or helium and combined with laser lights or fire soap bubbles can be filled with a flammable gas such as natural gas and then ignited of course this destroys the bubble

minnesota from 1964 1966 she received her bachelor of fine arts from the san francisco art institute in 1970 and in 1974 she began her career as an apprentice to bernice abbott davis first exhibition hung at the international center of photography new york in 1979 alongside her close friend robert mapplethorpe after her first trip to greenland in 1986 she gave up photographing the human form shifting her lens toward the monumental landscapes and cultural architectural icons for which she is renowned lynn davis is represented by the edwynn houk gallery in new york she lives in hudson new york with her husband writer rudy wurlitzer photography best know for her large scale black and white landscapes and photographs of monuments of the human and natural landscape perhaps the most noteworthy characteristic of her work is its striking tonality with strong grays subdued whites and blacks or often gold and selenium the genius of her sparse composition and controlled modeling of light produce a restrained majesty her obvious respect for her subject matter is evident not only in her celebrated architectural photos but in her portrait work as well her best known work was exposed during her travels to egypt australia cambodia burma thailand syria jordan turkey yemen lebanon and greenland under grant from the lannan foundation she undertook an ongoing project to photgraph various sites in the united states much of her work is done with vintage cameras like the ancient rolleiflex with which she records monuments in thailand and cambodia her husband rudy wurlitzer records this experience during a trip to thailand in his book hard travel to sacred places on the way back to the van lynn says that all morning her camera was on the edge of malfunctioning and that several times she thought the shutter had broken it was opening on the rewind which meant that everything would be overexposed she uses an ancient rolleiflex and has left her backup camera in new york it was strange lynn says with a faraway smile when it broke i just stopped and completely gave up i was ready to never take another picture and then the shutter just started to work again her meticulous work in the darkroom a blend of science and art is also responsible for the majestic tone of her work jonathon bailey in an article for camera arts listed her among a small group of photographers employing split toning to its fullest i think it s safe to suggest that all the photographers today who use some form of split toning in their work seem intimately connected to photography s past in some uniquely personal way each of these photographers seems to intuitively comprehend how the photographic process ultimately impacts the image s emotional impact i believe this aesthetic understanding flows directly out of a 19th century sensibility he attributed this in part to the unique and rich composition of her prints her prints appear in the permanent collections of the museum of modern art new york the los angeles county museum of art the chicago museum of contemporary art and the houston museum of fine arts among others in 1999 the j paul getty museum held an

 id=1631564 title business rules approach nonfiltered 1395 processed 1376 dbindex 1481410 business rules are abstractions of the policies and practices of a business organization the business rules approach is a development methodology where rules are in a form that is used by but does not have to be embedded in business process management systems the business rules approach formalizes an enterprise s critical business rules in a language the manager and technologist understand business rules create an unambiguous statement of what a business does with information to decide a proposition the formal specification becomes information for process and rules engines to run advantages the adoption of business rules adds another tier to systems that automate business processes compared to traditional systems this approach has the following major advantages lowers the cost incurred in the modification of business logic shortens development time rules are externalized and easily shared among multiple applications changes can be made faster and with less risk business rules represent a natural step in the application of computer technology aimed at enhancing productivity in the workplace automated business processes that have business logic embedded inside often take substantial time to change and such changes can be prone to errors and in a world where the life cycle of business models has greatly shortened it has become increasingly critical to be able to adapt to changes in external environments promptly these needs are addressed by a business rules approach through the use of business rules the agility of the business is enhanced and the manageability of business processes also increases as rules becomes more accessible technical details the programs designed specifically to run business rules are called rule engines more complete systems that support the authoring deployment and management of business rules are called business rules management systems brmss many commercial rule engines provide the rete algorithm or a proprietary algorithm that embodies many of the principles of rete however there are other execution algorithms such as the sequential algorithm ilog and blaze advisor terminology algorithms for evaluating decision tables trees as well as algorithms tuned for hierarchical xml the rete algorithm is a stateful pattern matching algorithm designed to minimize the evaluation of repetitive tests across many objects attributes and many rules there are different fields of usage which are best for rete based and non rete based execution algorithms for simple stateless applications with minimal sharing of conditions across rules a non rete based execution algorithm such as the sequential algorithm may be preferable for evaluating decision tables and trees an algorithm that exploits the hierarchical relationships between the rule conditions may perform better than a simple rete or sequential algorithm tuned for discrete rules business rules can be expressed in a way similar to conventional programming languages or in languages resembling natural ones haley systems haleyauthority and ruleburst limited s ruleburst 8 actually use natural language understanding to allow users to write rules in english rather than code in some commercial brms s such as pegasystems pegarules ilog s jrules fair isaac s blaze advisor or innovations visual rules rules can also be expressed in user friendly rule forms such as decision tables and decision trees provided with a suitable interface to design or edit decision tables or trees it is possible for business users to check or change rules directly with minimal it involvement when rules are expressed in a way similar to a natural language it is necessary to first define a vocabulary to be used which contains words and expressions that correspond to business objects and conditions and operations involving them to make the rules executable by a rule engine it is also necessary to implement the operations and conditions in a programming language with a defined and implemented vocabulary it is relatively easy to write rules in a brms changes can also be made quickly as long as they can be expressed in the existing vocabulary if not the vocabulary must be expanded accordingly rules can also be modelled with the business user taking the part of mapping their business logic and it being responsible for integration of data as well as integration of the generated code into the target application business rules are also key to the enterprise decision management approach to decision automation increasingly business rules are also viewed as a critical component of business process management solutions due to the need to ensure flexibility relation to database management as argued by christopher j date business rules translate into data integrity constraints when one thinks in terms of the relational model of database management thus a truly rdbms could be thought in terms of a declarative business rules engine with added data management capability this is currently implemented in rel and alphora dataphor however business rules need not only be regarded as constraints they can also be used to specify constructive business policies such as preferred clients get a discount of 10 used in this way business rules are like sql queries rather than data integrity constraints this solution direction is implemented in usoft by ness relation to business process management some analysts believe the combination of business rules technology with business process management offers an agile approach to workflow and enterprise integration bpm and br software support business goals by managing and running business processes and business rules in separate yet complementary ways a business process is often a complex map of flow controls it might have many subprocesses decisions and while loops wherever a decision or while loop appears business rules can evaluate the data provided by the process and control the basis for change in flows often there are separate reasons for updates to processes or rules new regulations or business strategies may affect the rules without changing core business processes new applications or procedures might change the business process in either case a composite approach to rules and processes can be very flexible as more and more bpm vendors either add business rules engines to their bpm engines or oem business rules management systems business rules seems to be becoming a subset of bpm see also business rules engine providers references http www javarules org endofarticle doc doc

 id=1875385 title vivian solon nonfiltered 1397 processed 1378 dbindex 1481412 vivian alvarez solon is an australian who was unlawfully removed to the philippines by the department of immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs dimia in july 2001 in may 2005 it became public knowledge that she had been deported although dimia knew of their mistake in 2003 solon s family had listed her as a missing person since july 2003 and until may 2005 did not know that she had been deported the circumstances surrounding solon s unlawful deportation have caused much controversy in the australian media in october 2005 a report on solon s deportation was released following an inquiry conducted by former victoria police commissioner neil comrie the report revealed that several senior dimia officials in canberra knew about solon s unlawful deportation in 2003 and 2004 and failed to act it also found that solon s mental and physical health problems were not given proper attention solon has since returned to australia on 18 november 2005 background vivian alvarez solon was born in the philippines on 30 october 1962 on 26 may 1984 she married an australian man robert young in the philippines she then changed her name to vivian solon young the two moved to brisbane queensland where solon was naturalised as an australian on 3 march 1986 in 1990 the couple separated and they divorced in 1993 after the divorce solon changed her name back to vivian alvarez solon between 1995 and 2000 solon received treatment for mental health issues she was diagnosed as suffering from a paranoid psychotic condition which affected her behaviour during this time she developed a minor criminal record with the queensland police and was at one point taken into protective custody by police in brisbane who were worried about the effects of her mental condition on one occasion her fingerprints were recorded and entered into the national law enforcement database crimtrac deportation from australia according to a police report ms solon had left her five year old son at the brisbane city hall childcare facility on february 16 2001 but did not return to pick him up queensland premier peter beattie revealed on may 6 2005 that her son now nine has been in foster care since at 11 47pm on the night of march 30 ambulance services were called to a park in lismore in the far north of new south wales they found solon next to an open drain in the park suffering from head injuries she also had difficulty moving her legs she had most likely sustained these injuries after falling into the drain although some media reports speculated that she had been in a car accident she was taken to lismore base hospital where she was treated for her injuries she was soon moved to the psychiatric ward because she was behaving aggressively towards hospital staff presumably because of her head injuries a social worker who visited solon at the hospital identified that she was of filipino background and suspected that she was an illegal immigrant on this basis the social worker contacted the local branch of the department of immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs dimia officers first interviewed solon on may 3 2001 according to the comrie report the officers presumed that solon was an illegal immigrant and did not do proper background checks on july 12 solon was transferred from the hospital to dimia custody taken to a motel in brisbane she told the officials that she was an australian citizen and did not want to leave the country however she was ignored on july 17 queensland police officially listed solon as a missing person several months after she had failed to collect her son from childcare however this information was not picked up by dimia a representative from the philippines consulate in brisbane visited solon on july 18 in the meeting solon said that she had been married to an australian man a mr young but this information was not passed on to dimia the consulate refused to issue solon with travel documents because they did not consider her fit enough to travel she was in a wheelchair at the time and so dimia arranged for a different doctor to visit her this doctor declared her fit to fly and so on july 20 solon was escorted onto a plane by queensland police and flown to manila handed over to qantas ground staff at the airport she was eventually taken to a hospice run by the catholic church discovery in july 2003 the missing persons bureau in queensland contacted dimia with an enquiry about solon who had been listed as a missing person for two years two dimia officers in canberra conducted searches of records and made a match between vivian solon as she was known to the missing persons authorities and vivian alvarez as she was known to dimia alvarez is her middle name they told their supervisor referred to in the comrie report as officer a on july 14 that an australian citizen had been deported but the supervisor did nothing on 20 august 2003 an episode of the television program without a trace was aired which contained a crime stoppers segment with information about solon and her photograph at the conclusion of the program one of the officers in canberra referred to in the comrie report as officer e again told the supervisor who again did nothing at the same time a dimia officer in brisbane who had worked on solon s case in 2001 also saw the crime stoppers segment and informed her supervisor that supervisor also did nothing officer e decided to approach the missing persons bureau directly in september 2003 the bureau approached the department of foreign affairs and trade dfat for help in searching for solon dfat informed the bureau that solon had traveled to the philippines eventually solon s former husband robert young was informed where solon was throughout early 2004 young persisted in questioning the bureau until it eventually decided to contact dimia the bureau was put through to officer a in canberra who had already been told twice of solon s unlawful deportation officer a then contacted the brisbane office and learned that other people there knew about the error made however again no action was taken and the minister for immigration at the time philip ruddock was not informed on 4 april 2005 young contacted the new minister for immigration senator amanda vanstone directly vanstone s office inquired into the case and discovered what had happened to solon solon s dimia case file was not stored with the normal case files and was instead found separately in the desk of one of officer a s subordinates vanstone then ordered the australian federal police afp in cooperation with the national bureau of investigation nbi in the philippines to locate solon nbi chief ricardo diaz reported on lateline on may 6 2005 that their search was unsuccessful after three weeks mr diaz also claimed that the afp was not forthcoming with information to locate ms solon while watching the news on abc asia pacific catholic priest father mike duffin an australian from saint vincent s parish church watched reports about the hunt for vivian solon and wondered if the reports may have referred to a vivian that was brought to the mother teresa sisters missionaries of charity in olongapo city by australian representatives four years ago he recognised her from the photo that was used in the report father duffin was surprised that the australian government was unaware of her location duffin said they are the ones who told her before she left australia she was coming to the mission coming to mother teresa sisters and then when they brought her they left her at the mother teresa sisters missionaries of charity so i find it very hard that they don t know where they left her do they have no records or do people forget things as soon as they do them however senator vanstone disputed father duffin s claims of prior knowledge by the australian government she informed the media on 12 may 2005 that immigration records had no mention of ms solon being brought to a convent instead her records showed that she was met at the airport by a woman from the overseas workers welfare association ms vanstone also revealed that the files also showed that there was mention of a discussion with solon on the possibility of her making contact with some nuns following identification of vivian solon at the mother teresa sisters missionaries of charity the australian government sent consular officials to confirm her identity senator vanstone announced that if ms solon wished to return to australia the australian government would provide assistance for her to do so there was speculation in the media that solon did not want to return to australia media controversy an anonymous senior immigration official reported to lateline that solon s situation was due to a systematic problem in the department of immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs lateline reported that the official said in the compliance area people on the whole are a bunch of cowboys under so much pressure to deport people all proper processes have broken down they put their energy into picking up people and deporting them without proper investigation the social worker who was one of the last people given access to ms solon before her deportation said she had requested from immigration the grounds for solon s deportation this one it just really baffled me because they said they couldn t find any paperwork or documentation about her while being escorted back to manila by australian embassy officials on may 13 2005 ms solon revealed that she was unaware that she had been deported according to solon she was informed by australian officials that she had to be sent to philippines for treatment and received travel assistance from them she also indicated that she had informed immigration officers that she had an australian passport but was not carrying it at that time lateline confirmed with the department of foreign affairs and trade on may 14 2005 that ms solon had been issued a passport valid at the time she was deported since ms solon has been an australian she was issued three passports and had traveled on an australian passport for ten years her last passport was issued on november 2000 but never collected comrie inquiry the solon case was initially referred to the palmer inquiry which was set up to inquire into the unlawful detention of cornelia rau in an immigration facility senator vanstone decided that the case should be inquired into separately and instructed the commonwealth ombudsman professor john mcmillan to hold an investigation the ombudsman appointed neil comrie former commissioner of the victoria police to conduct the investigation criticism of the inquiry the decision to hold a non judicial inquiry was criticised by certain groups who did not believe that it had sufficient powers to compel witnesses to testify dr sev ozdowski a commissioner on the human rights and equal opportunity commission called for a royal commission into solon s case saying it certainly warrants an open inquiry which can get all of the facts it warrants an inquiry which would allow witnesses to come forward which would provide protection to witnesses and it warrants an inquiry which will have access to all relevant documents so it could be a judicial inquiry it could be a royal commission it could be some other form of inquiry but it s important that it s an independent inquiry with access to both witnesses and information premier of queensland peter beattie had also written to prime minister john howard calling for a royal commission into solon s deportation and the detention of cornelia rau according to beattie the framework of the palmer inquiry did not provide sufficient legal protection leading to the refusal of twelve corrective services staff to refuse to give testimony on may 12 2005 australian democrats senator andrew bartlett with the support of the australian greens and the australian labor party alp initiated a debate in the australian senate for a judicial inquiry or royal commission into the operation and administration of mandatory detention deportation and enforcement the government expressed a belief that was not necessary to rush into a judicial inquiry then as the facts of the matters had not been determined by the palmer inquiry report of the inquiry the report was completed on 26 september 2005 and was released on 6 october the report was strongly critical of dimia concluding that a combination of incompetence inadequate training improper data systems and poor management led to solon s deportation the report found that dimia had not investigated solon s case properly before it decided to deport her the only evidence in solon s file which seemed to indicate that she was not legally in australia was a handwritten note which was not dated or signed by anyone which stated smuggled into australia as a sex slave wants to return to the philippines has been physically abused the inquiry concluded that dimia officials had simply acted on unfounded assumptions about solon rather than discovering real evidence they assumed that solon s surname was alvarez actually her middle name and conducted their initial searches based on this name as such they found no record of her there were eleven different spellings used by various officials which also led to confusion the initial investigation did not take into account the fact that solon had been treated in the psychiatric ward in lismore which might have explained inconsistencies in evidence she gave to dimia officials some key recommendations of the inquiry were that the negative culture in the compliance division of dimia be redressed that dimia should review its information systems that all staff should be instructed to take more care when performing their duties and not act on the basis of assumptions that all immigration detainees should be provided with adequate healthcare services the report also reaffirmed a number of the recommendations of the palmer inquiry response to the report following the release of the report senator vanstone announced that aud 50 3 million would be spent on a college of immigration border security and compliance in order to train dimia staff aud 17 9 million would also be spent on improving healthcare services at immigration facilities labor spokesperson for immigration tony burke called for senator vanstone to take responsibility for solon s deportation under the doctrine of ministerial responsibility however vanstone refused to resign saying that the general presumption was that ministers should not be responsible for things they did not know about she also said i m thinking of trying to buy the copyright on elton john s song i m still standing but i don t want to tempt fate so i ll just play it to myself quietly at night compensation claims before ms solon s return to australia there was speculation in both the media and in the legal community about the possibility of a compensation claim being brought by her against the commonwealth government and or the department of immigration sydney based lawyer george newhouse brought a legal team together including former federal court judge and human rights and equal opportunity commission president marcus einfeld q c and lawyer harry freedman who travelled to manila to discuss legal options with the solon family terry o gorman president of the australian council for civil liberties defended the urgency of legal action he said only the federal government having to pay out money and having to defend a court case will bring home to the federal immigration minister and the prime minister that rights and principles are there to be observed criticism of this government over its immigration policy is simply waived away only when they have to pay money will they sit up and take notice on vivian s return to australia on 18 november 2005 marcus einfeld q c confirmed that vivian s compensation would be determined by retired high court judge sir anthony mason after vivian and her legal team had reached agreement on the form of a private arbitration as part of the deal the commonwealth government confirmed that it would care for vivian until the arbitration process was completed on 30 november 2006 sir anthony mason awarded solon a compensation payout reported by the age newspaper as aud 4 5 million although the australian government refused

president of burlington industries a textile company ray kassar was hired in february 1978 as president of atari s consumer division by warner communications who at the time owned atari by this time rifts had begun to develop between the original atari staff most of whom had engineering backgrounds and the new hires brought in by warner who like kassar mostly had business backgrounds in november of 1978 when atari founder nolan bushnell left the company after a dispute with warner over the future of atari kassar became ceo under his leadership sweeping changes were made at atari and the laid back atmosphere that had existed under bushnell s leadership all but disappeared kassar s twenty five years at burlington industries had given him a taste for order organization and efficiency and his efforts to revamp atari along similar lines provoked substantial animosity kassar shifted the focus away from game development and more toward marketing and sales atari began to promote games all year around instead of just at the christmas season r d also suffered deep cuts and the discipline and security at atari became strict kassar became unaffectionately known to many at atari as the sock king and the towel czar due to his previous years in the textile industry after he once referred to atari programmers as high strung prima donnas in an interview with the san jose mercury news in 1979 during the kassar years atari s sales grew from 75 million in 1977 to over 2 2 billion just three years later though atari enjoyed some of its greatest success during this period the stifling atmosphere and lack of royalties or recognition to the individual game designers angered employees many of whom quit several of these former atari employees would go on to form activision during this period nearly all members of the original atari staff including al alcorn quit or were fired atari s upper management also suffered severe turnover rates many blamed ray kassar s autocratic management style but kassar was not held accountable in 1981 the highly popular and successful game yars revenge was released for the atari 2600 howard scott warshaw the game s designer got the names yar and razak by jokingly spelling ray kassar backwards in 1982 kassar donated a sum of money to brown university his alma mater in recognition the university named a university building the edward w kassar house the kassar house is currently home to the university s mathematics department contrary to popular belief kassar was not responsible for deal to make the e t the extra terrestrial game off of the blockbuster movie steve ross ceo of atari s parent company warner communications was the one who was in talks with steven spielberg and universal pictures kassar s response to ross query of how he liked the idea of making an e t based video game was i think it s a dumb idea we ve never really made an action game out of a movie ultimately though the decision was not kassar s to make and it went through and it was reported that atari had paid us 20 25 million for the rights an abnormally high figure for video game licencing at the time the game was not only poorly received and sold poorly but demand had been widely overestimated in july of 1983 kassar was forced to resign from atari over mounting allegations of illegal insider trading activity in december of 1982 kassar had sold 5 000 shares of stock in warner communications only hours before a much lower than expected fourth quarter earnings report would cause warner stock to drop nearly 40 in value in the following days the securities and exchange commission accused kassar and then atari vice president dennis groth of trading stock with illegal insider knowledge kassar settled returning his profits without acknowledging guilt or innocence the shares that kassar sold actually constituted only a small amount of his total holdings in the company and the sec later cleared him of any wrongdoing upon ray kassar s resignation james j morgan formerly of philip morris replaced him as ceo of atari in september of 1983 since that time kassar has focused on investments and other hobbies he is now retired from

 id=1393811 title agnostic theism nonfiltered 1416 processed 1397 dbindex 1481431 agnostic theism is the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism an agnostic theist is one who views that the truth value of certain claims particularly existence of god s is unknown or inherently unknowable but chooses to believe in god s in spite of this there are contrasting views of the term views of agnostic theism many views exist depending on how theism agnosticism belief and knowledge are defined theism as belief in god s agnosticism as don t can t know according to theism the opinion that gods or deities exist and agnosticism is that existence unknown or inherently unknowable belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification agnosticism does not violate this and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism the classical philosophical understanding of knowledge is that knowledge is justified true belief by this definition it is reasonable to assert that one may hold a belief and that belief may be true without asserting that one knows it agnostic theism could be interpreted as an admission that it is not possible to justify one s belief in god s sufficiently for it to be considered known according to fideism this logic statement was used christian theology teaches that people are saved by faith in the christian god i e trust in the empirically unprovable but if the christian god s existence can be proven either empirically or logically to that extent faith becomes unnecessary or irrelevant therefore if christian theology is true no immediate proof of the christian god s existence is possible see also sola fide according to faith faith by its very nature requires belief outside of known fact according to existence of god agnosticism agnostics may or may not still believe in gods based on fideilistic convictions theism as belief agnosticism as doubt of god s christian atheism a position that would qualify as agnostic theist would be in a temporary state of doubt in short a theist becomes an agnostic theist when they lose their confidence in the existence of a divinity to some degree but still choose to believe in it theists may admit that they experience such doubts that they do not wish to question in which case they become an agnostic theist if they experience something that assures them of the existence of some form of divinity then they will no longer qualify as agnostic theists theism as belief in knowing of god s agnosticism as doubt of god according to theologies opposed to fideism other christian views such as catholicism theism requires 100 belief with no doubt at all and agnosticism is a form of doubt what is agnostic theism on about com on what is agnostic theism the author talks about the position that agnosticism is more reasonable than theism because it eschews theism s dogmatism being inaccurate and how atheism and theism deal with belief agnosticism deals with knowledge weak agnosticism is about personally not having knowledge of god and strong agnosticism is believing that knowledge about god is impossible since belief and knowledge are independent it s possible to be both faith contrasts with knowledge and people believe through faith even christians have to admit they don t know everything about god especially using the phrase god works in mysterious ways other pages on atheism vs agnosticism it distinguishes the differences in meanings of agnosticism and atheism and explains how agnosticism is compatible with both atheism and theism also if atheism is closed minded then so is theism and if theism can be open minded then so can atheism problems and criticism this biggest problem and criticism of agnostic theism is the simple argument that in order to be religious you must believe in god whether or not you have proof if you acknowledge you don t have proof but you still believe in god this is consistent with fideism if you acknowledge you don t have proof and you let that knowledge affect your belief then you can not really consider yourself religious if the former statement that proof does not negate belief is to be considered a proper definition of agnostic theism then there is no difference between it and fideism george h smith s rebuttal in atheism the case against god george h smith argues that all agnosticism is a form of atheism defined here as lacking a belief in a deity his argument against agnostic theism is that it is contradictory to state that a being is inherently or currently unknowable and yet positively assert a belief in its existence his argument goes one cannot possibly know that something exists without some knowledge of what it is that exists if it is declared unknowable the concept of god becomes meaningless the agnostic theist s statement of belief therefore becomes equivalent to a blark exists this unspecified belief i believe in something is equivalent to nonbelief i am not convinced by any particular religious claim therefore the so called agnostic theist is in fact an atheist by being unable to assert a positive belief in any specific deity it ensues that all agnosticism is a form of atheism if the agnostic theist still wishes to believe he must ascribe attributes of some sort to the belief however they would then be claiming some knowledge of their deity and are therefore no longer agnostics but are theists instead smith concisely describes the paradox on pg 44 to posit the existence of something which by its nature cannot be known to man is to submerge oneself in hopeless contradictions when one claims that something is unknowable can one produce knowledge in support of this claim if one cannot one s assertion is arbitrary and utterly without merit if one can one has accomplished the impossible one has knowledge of the unknowable the theist who is called upon to explain the content of his belief and who then introduces the unknowable as a supposed characteristic of the concept itself is saying in effect i will explain the concept of god by pointing out that it cannot be explained see also agnostic

 id=7277012 title greedy algorithm for egyptian fractions nonfiltered 1422 processed 1403 dbindex 1481437 in mathematics an egyptian fraction is a representation of a natural number as a sum of unit fractions as e g 5 6 1 2 1 3 as the name indicates these representations have been used as long ago as ancient egypt but the first published systematic method for constructing such expansions is described in the liber abaci 1202 of leonardo of pisa fibonacci it is called a greedy algorithm because at each step the algorithm chooses greedily the largest possible unit fraction that can be used in any representation of the remaining fraction fibonacci actually lists several different methods for constructing egyptian fraction representations sigler 2002 chapter ii 7 he includes the greedy method as a last resort for situations when several simpler methods fail see egyptian fraction for a more detailed listing of these methods as salzer 1948 details the greedy method and extensions of it for the approximation of irrational numbers have been rediscovered several times by modern mathematicians earliest and most notably by sylvester 1880 see for instance cahen 1891 and spiess 1907 a closely related expansion method that produces closer approximations at each step by allowing some unit fractions in the sum to be negative dates back to lambert 1770 the expansion produced by this method for a number x is called the greedy egyptian expansion sylvester expansion or fibonacci sylvester expansion of x however the term fibonacci expansion usually refers not to this method but to representation of integers as sums of fibonacci numbers algorithm and examples in fibonacci s algorithm we expand the fraction x y that we desire to represent by repeatedly performing the replacement simplifying the second term in this replacement as necessary for instance in this expansion the denominator 3 of the first unit fraction is the result of rounding 15 7 up to the next larger integer and the remaining fraction 2 15 is the result of simplifying 15 mod 7 15 3 6 45 the denominator of the second unit fraction 8 is the result of rounding 15 2 up to the next larger integer and the remaining fraction 1 120 is what is left from 7 15 after subtracting both 1 3 and 1 8 as each expansion step reduces the numerator of the remaining fraction to be expanded this method always terminates with a finite expansion however compared to ancient egyptian expansions or to more modern methods this method may produce expansions that are quite long with large denominators for instance this method expands while other methods lead to the much better expansion wagon 1991 suggests an even more badly behaved example 31 311 by the greedy method we get an expansion with ten terms the last of which has over 500 digits in its denominator however there exists a much shorter representation 1 12 1 63 1 2799 1 8708 sylvester s sequence and closest approximation sylvester s sequence 2 3 7 43 1807 can be viewed as generated by an infinite greedy expansion of this type for the number one where at each step we choose the denominator instead of truncating this sequence to k terms and forming the corresponding egyptian fraction e g for k 4 results in the closest possible underestimate of 1 by any k term egyptian fraction curtiss 1922 soundararajan 2005 that is for example any egyptian fraction for a number in the open interval 1805 1806 1 requires at least five terms curtiss 1922 describes an application of these closest approximation results in lower bounding the number of divisors of a perfect number while stong 1983 describes applications in group theory maximum length expansions and congruence conditions any fraction x y requires at most x terms in its greedy expansion mays 1987 and freitag and phillips 1999 examine the conditions under which x y leads to an expansion with exactly x terms these can be described in terms of congruence conditions on y every fraction 1 y requires one term in its expansion the simplest such fraction is 1 1 every fraction 2 y for odd y 1 requires two terms in its expansion the simplest such fraction is 2 3 a fraction 3 y requires three terms in its expansion if and only if y 1 mod 6 for then y mod x 2 and y y 2 3 is odd so the fraction remaining after a single step of the greedy expansion is in simplest terms the simplest fraction 3 y with a three term expansion is 3 7 a fraction 4 y requires four terms in its expansion if and only if y 1 or 17 mod 24 for then the numerator y mod x of the remaining fraction is 3 and the denominator is 1 mod 6 the simplest fraction 4 y with a four term expansion is 4 17 the erd s straus conjecture states that all fractions 4 y have an expansion with three or fewer terms but when y 1 or 17 mod 24 such expansions must be found by methods other than the greedy algorithm more generally the sequence of the smallest denominators y leading to the longest expansion for each x is 1 3 7 17 31 109 253 97 271 approximation of polynomial roots stratemeyer 1930 and salzer 1947 describe a method of finding an accurate approximation for the roots of a polynomial by applying the greedy algorithm to compute the greedy expansion of the root at each step maintaining a polynomial the root of which is the remaining fraction to be expanded for instance suppose we want to find the greedy expansion of the golden ratio one of the two solutions of the polynomial equation p0 x x2 x 1 0 following stratemeyer and salzer we perform the following sequence of steps since p0 x 0 for x 1 and p0 x 0 for all x 2 there must be a root of p0 x between 1 and 2 that is the first term of the greedy expansion of the golden ratio is 1 1 if x1 is the remaining fraction after the first step of the greedy expansion it satisfies the equation p0 x1 1 0 which we can expand as p1 x1 x12 x1 1 0 since p1 x 0 for x 1 2 and p1 x 0 for all x 1 the root we are seeking lies between 1 2 and 1 and the next term in its greedy expansion is 1 2 if x2 is the remaining fraction after this step of the greedy expansion it satisfies the equation p1 x2 1 2 0 which we can expand as p2 x2 4x22 8x2 1 0 since p2 x 0 for x 1 9 and p2 x 0 for all x 1 8 the next term in the greedy expansion is 1 9 if x3 is the remaining fraction after this step of the greedy expansion it satisfies the equation p2 x3 1 9 0 which we can again expand as a polynomial equation with integer coefficients p3 x3 324x32 720x3 5 0 continuing this approximation process eventually produces the greedy expansion for the golden ratio other integer sequences the length minimum denominator and maximum denominator of the greedy expansion for all fractions with small numerators and denominators can be found in the on line encyclopedia of integer sequences as sequences a050205 a050206 and a050210 respectively in addition the greedy expansion of any irrational number leads to an infinite increasing sequence of integers and the oeis contains expansions of several well known constants some additional entries in the oeis though not labeled as being produced by the greedy algorithm appear to be of the same type related expansions in general if one wants an egyptian fraction expansion in which the denominators are constrained in some way it is possible to define a greedy algorithm in which at each step one chooses the expansion where d is chosen among all possible values satisfying the constraints as small as possible such that xd y and such that d is distinct from all previously chosen denominators for instance the engel expansion can be viewed as an algorithm of this type in which each successive denominator must be a multiple of the previous one however it may be difficult to determine whether an algorithm of this type can always succeed in finding a finite expansion in particular the odd greedy expansion of a fraction x y is formed by a greedy algorithm of this type in which all denominators are constrained to be odd numbers it is known that whenever y is odd there is a finite egyptian fraction expansion in which all denominators are odd but it is not known whether the odd greedy expansion is always finite

 id=8692493 title dracula spanish version nonfiltered 1423 processed 1404 dbindex 1481438 dracula is a spanish language version of the more famous tod browning directed dracula starring bela lugosi it the early days of sound it was common for hollywood studios to produce foreign language versions of their films usually in french spanish and german using the same sets costumes and etc unfortunately most of these foreign language versions no longer exist the spanish version of dracula is an exception the spanish language version of drácula was made by director george melford who simultaneously filmed the movie using the same sets at night in recent years this version has become more highly praised by some than the english language version the spanish crew had the advantage of watching the dailies from the english crew s version when they came in for the evening and they would figure out better camera angles and more effective use of lighting in an attempt to top it as a result this version s supporters consider it to be much more artistically effective the spanish semiologist roman gubern considers that the longer duration allows better development of the plot in spite of the shorted shooting time and smaller budget the spanish version was included as a bonus feature on the classic monster collection dvd in 1999 the legacy collection dvd in 2004 and the 75th anniversary edition dvd set in 2006 cast carlos villarías as carlos villar as count dracula lupita tovar as eva barry norton as juan harker pablo álvarez rubio as renfield eduardo arozamena as abraham van helsing josé soriano viosca as dr seward carmen guerrero as lucia amelia senisterra as marta manuel arbó as martin geraldine dvorak as bride cornelia thaw as bride dorothy tree as bride plot summary renfield a solicitor makes a journey into transylvania via stagecoach he mentions his destination castle dracula to the locals who react with alarm they tell him count dracula is a vampire and when he doesn t believe them one insists he wear a cross when he arrives at the castle the count bids him welcome after drinking drugged wine renfield drops the cross and is bitten aboard ship a now enslaved renfield laughs menaically below as dracula picks off the crew one by one when the ship reaches england he is the only living person found dracula meets dr seward and his family at the opera lucia is completely fascinated by him and that night becomes his victim professor van helsing is called in and he recognizes the danger for what it is he also realizes that dr seward s patient renfield is somehow tied up in events but soon after meeting the doctor s new neighbor dracula he figures out who is a vampire based on the fact dracula casts no reflection in the mirror not a moment too soon because by now seward s daughter eva is falling under his spell to her horror she feels increasingly weak and also increasingly wild at one point attacking her fiancee juan with seward s and harker s help van helsing seeks to trap dracula but he outwits them and escapes with eva by seizing control of a nurse s mind they follow renfield into carfax abbey an act which ends with dracula killing his slave by strangulation then tossing him from a tall staircase deep in the catacombs under carfax they find dracula asleep and eva still alive van helsing drives a stake through the vampire s heart deviations from the novel this list is not exhaustive but intended to convey a sense of the differences between the film and the novel the setting is shifted to circa 1930 renfield goes to transylvania and is victimized he is found insane aboard the demeter dracula does not youthen the characters of arthur holmwood and quincey morris are omitted dr seward is eva s father not lucy s suitor lucy is his ward dracula does not have multiple coffins he can only change into a bat not a wolf dracula must sleep by day dracula is killed by van helsing with a wooden stake differences with the english version at the borgo pass the coach driver from the castle who is dracula in disguise actually has his face covered renfield cuts his finger with a breadknife not a paper clip the brides bite renfield rather than dracula himself the plotline of whatever happened to lucia is resolved van helsing destroys her in this version we get to see an additional exterior shot of carfax abbey not seen in the us version eva s costume is far more revealing than the one worn by helen chandler when renfield is in carfax abbey he carried a torch rather than a lamp his death is more violent is this version as well in general there is a great deal more camera movement and atmospheric lighting trivia two years after this film was made lupita tovar married the producer paul kohner according to the book hollywood gothic only carlos villarías in the cast was allowed to watch dailies from the english language version he was encouraged to be as lugosi like as possible see also dracula us 1931

eventually kung lao faced shao kahn the emperor of outworld defeated kung lao and injured him so badly that he was believed to have died hearing of kung lao s apparent death enraged liu kang as he challenged shao kahn and successfully defeated him for the second time with outworld driven back kung lao decided not to return to the shaolin temples instead allowing everyone to believe that he was dead and went on to live a life of peace in respect to the beliefs of his ancestors this would not last long however as he was drawn away from his newfound peace to help fight against shinnok s forces when word reached him that goro the shokan warrior who had killed the great kung lao centuries ago was still alive after shinnok s defeat kung lao attacked goro who had signed a peace treaty with the centaurs under the mediation of kitana instead of being an attempted assassination however the blow was a ceremonial strike of vengeance for the great kung lao s death with this act the two warriors shook hands their feud over the next years were peaceful this ended on a brutal note at the time of mortal kombat deadly alliance when the sorcerers quan chi and shang tsung united and murdered liu kang in a vicious attack tsung posing as kung lao to get close to the champion kung lao found the body of his longtime friend and was told immediately by raiden that tsung was the assassin who had formed the deadly alliance with quan chi enraged kung lao vowed revenge upon the sorcerer and once again abandoned his pacifist shaolin beliefs he believed his current skills were insufficient to defeat shang tsung so after meeting with the other earthrealm warriors and traveling to outworld kung lao sought the advice of the martial arts teacher bo rai cho bo rai cho trained kung lao for a short time teaching him the whirlwind kick maneuver together they joined the other warriors in the assault against the two sorcerers kung lao would not rest until liu kang was avenged and shang tsung had paid with his life but the assault did not end well with liu kang dead raiden and his companions were fighting a losing battle kung lao and kitana challenged the deadly alliance kung lao fought shang tsung one on one but because of shang tsung s soulnado the sorcerer was able to keep his power at it s peak making the battle very difficult things would get worse as kung lao s allies would perish in the battle one by one kitana would fall against quan chi and kung lao would fall to the hands of shang tsung despite his improved skills it wasn t enough and kung lao died leaving only raiden to battle the deadly alliance however kung lao was revived by onaga as a slave during the events of deception but in mk armageddon he is shown apparently released from onaga s control without any explanation given as to how it happened ermac s deception ending which shows him and liu kang s spirit being successful in rescuing the slaved earthrealm warriors is generally accepted as the possible explanation though no official word has been made as to whether this is true or not fujin s bio for mortal kombat armageddon describes kung lao as having joined forces with the god of wind to bring their former comrades raiden and liu kang under control with the god of thunder becoming as ruthless as shao kahn and liu kang s corpse selectively slaying various people fujin then goes on to state in his bio that if no way was found to revert the two corrupted warriors back to normal both he and kung lao would be forced to finish them it is as yet unknown what kung lao s outlook on this matter is at least until his own bio is officially released by midway in his armageddon ending kung lao goes back in time after defeating blaze he meets his old ancestor and with his blessing takes his place in the mortal kombat tournament he defeats goro and becomes the mk champion and was a legend as a result liu kang never competed and his and kung lao s rivalry with him never came to be mortal kombat shaolin monks and characterization changes in the adventure game mortal kombat shaolin monks kung lao s character was explored to a greater degree than had been shown in the previous mk games however the character presented in mortal kombat shaolin monks is very different then the kung lao seen in mortal kombat ii through deadly alliance many fans do not consider the events of mk sm as canon as it contradicts mortal kombat ii story many times as the game progresses and kung lao fans are also highly critical of his characterisation here kung lao as depicted in mk sm is almost resentful of liu kang s victory in the shaolin tournament although he and liu kang are shown to be friends much of the time he constantly baits his fellow shaolin monk especially regarding princess kitana and the tournament that raiden in reality a disguised shang tsung has sent them to compete in a rivalry between the two shaolin monks was hence established for the first time in mk sm as the two fighters defeated shang tsung s warriors they gained victories in mortal kombat forming a race of sorts to become the champion of mortal kombat kung lao especially is seen gloating to liu kang that he will win this tournament this rivalry escalates until the two warriors are convinced that the other has been corrupted by the outworld this character is completely at odds with the kung lao in mortal kombat gold and mortal kombat deadly alliance in these games it is established that kung lao is at heart a man of peace he fights when he must to defeat shinnok to avenge liu kang and stop the deadly alliance but at his core he wishes to pursue the pacifist ideals of his ancestors and thus he disappeared after his death in shao kahn s invasion to live his life according to these principles in contrast the kung lao in mk sm is eager to fight and has an almost desperate need to beat liu kang in the outworld supposedly to free his ancestors with the somewhat immature dialogue at times between liu kang and kung lao in mk sm many fans were angry at the way the noble shaolin monk had been portrayed as a battle hungry glory seeker with mortal kombat armageddon s release it seems to the disappointment of many fans that the creative team are considering the rivalry between liu kang and kung lao as canonical kung lao s ending makes reference to this stating that he was able to go back in time stand in for the great kung lao to his agreement and defeat goro 500 years before liu kang ending the rivalry before it started combat characteristics signature moves wind teleport kung lao

backstabbed by kano in the battlewave series he joins with kitana baraka and sub zero in an attempt to ovethrow the emperor shao kahn during the comics he shares a very close relation with kitana contradicting the games official story about liu kang and kitana s love relationship kung lao was featured in his own eponymous one shot issue from malibu comics in the summer of 1995 the comic entitled rising son shows kung lao s struggle against shang tsung and his shape shifting mind tricks using his friend s forms kitana baraka and sub zero as well as his ancestor s form to kill him it would be the very last issue produced in malibu s mortal kombat series trivia his mk3 character bio was not included in the arcade version of mortal kombat 3 it was later made available for the home versions of mk3 kung lao s hat was inspired by the 1964 james bond movie goldfinger in which a character named oddjob threw his derby as a weapon he and kintaro are the only characters from the first two mk games who have not appeared in any of the movies and the cartoon series midway has not enlightened whether kung lao s hat is an ancestral item used by the great kung lao or a weapon he made for

english as the kouga ninja scrolls as the beautiful young princess of iga tsubagakure oboro was selected to be one of ten ninja to represent her clan against the ten chosen fighters of the rival koga manjidani clan born with mystic eyes oboro has the power to neutralize the techniques of any ninja that meets her gaze directly after the death of her grandmother ogen oboro ascends to take leadership of the clan but due to her passive demeanor soon finds her authority usurped by yakushiji tenzen among the iga princess oboro is something of an oddity sweet natured with a gentle disposition oboro lacks any real talent for either martial arts or ninjutsu and is also a bit of a clutz this along with her love for gennosuke of the rival koga clan has caused most of iga to view oboro as something of a black sheep a fact she is painfully aware of when the hattori truce is lifted the other iga ten are quick to take advantage of oboro s feelings for gennosuke tricking her into inviting him and udono jousuke into their compound where the iga can keep them under surveillance although hurt and betrayed by their actions oboro remains loyal to her clan and is greatly torn between her duty and her feelings when the truth of the renewed conflict is finally revealed to her ultimately she makes the decision to temporarily seal her eyes shut with a potion given to her by ogen called the seven days of darkness knowing that if she saw any of her clansmen attacking gennosuke she might be tempted to use her powers against them instead prior to the lifting of the hattori truce oboro was engaged to kouga gennosuke in an attempt to bring a lasting peace between both clans the two had known each other since childhood and were anxious to spend their lives with each other in the anime oboro would frequently meet with gennosuke along their clan s borders to practice a japanese fan dance which they planned to perform for their guests at their wedding in the anime she is voiced by nana mizuki japanese and laura bailey english conflicts oboro vs jingoro episode 4 while not a match in the traditional sense the scene is notable as it s the first time the audience witnesses oboro s stronger and borderline ruthless side after breaking up the fight between akeginu and udono jousuke oboro came across a trail left by amayo jingoro in his transformed state leading from the clan s salt shed to the guest house where gennosuke was staying upon confirming her lover s safety oboro located jingoro skulking in the rafters of the guest house s veranda and promptly used her mystic eyes to cancel his technique and forcibly revert him into a semi solid state despite akeginu s pleas for oboro to give him water so jingoro could safely resume him human form oboro ordered jingoro to be left alone and sent him crawling in agony toward a nearby spring as punishment for his transgression oboro vs tenzen episode 14 in perhaps the series darkest moment oboro was confronted in her cabin by tenzen while she and other remaining iga were travelling by boat to sunpu to intercept the koga tenzen again attempted to convince her to fight alongside the others and bring victory to their clan but oboro stated that even if her eyes weren t sealed by the seven days of darkness she was unable to physically or mentally stand against gennosuke and had already accepted that she would die by her lover s hands to which tenzen replied left him with only once choice as he menacingly caressed her cheek when oboro nervously asked if he intended to kill her tenzen replied that he was going to make her forget about gennosuke by filling her with the spirit of iga iow he was going to have sex with her outraged and frightened oboro attempted to slap him away but tenzen grabbed her wrist and pulled her against him his hand slipping inside her kimono to roughly fondle her breast oboro screamed in terror as tenzen then wrestled her to the deck pinning her beneath him as he pulled open her kimono and told oboro the others knew what was occuring and had agreed not to interfere in truth tenzen had sent akeginu and jingoro under false pretenses to the other side of the ship while chikuma koshirou stood guard outside the cabin as she turbulently struggled beneath him tenzen reminded oboro amidst his malicious pawing of her that the only men left in iga who could possibly qualify for her husband was himself koshirou and jingoro oboro frantically screamed that she would rather die than be with anyone besides gennosuke and begged tenzen to kill her but tenzen sinisterly answered that her bloodline was far too important to do so as he attempted to force her legs open outside koshirou covered his ears to block out oboro s cries for help his mind torn between his devotion to his princess and his loyalty to his sensei although he knew oboro was the rightful leader of tsubagakure and didn t deserve to be treated so cruelly he was unable to stand against his mentor s orders as tenzen was the best chance the iga had of obtaining victory it was only until after oboro began screaming for him specifically causing images of her innocent smiling face to flash in his mind that koshirou was unable to take it anymore and he frantically stumbled into oboro s cabin begging tenzen to stop but someone else had beaten him to it from out of the deck kasumi gyoubu had materialized behind tenzen and strangled him before tenzen could achieve penetration his powerful hands crushing tenzen s throat like a paper cup as both were blind neither oboro nor koshirou understood what had occured and unbeknownst to her gyoubu had materialized behind oboro and was seconds away from killing her in the same manner when akeginu and jingoro stormed into the cabin although safe for the moment the event traumatized oboro into staying as far away as she could from tenzen for the rest of the series oboro gennosuke vs tenzen episode 22 23 the climactic fight of the series unable to bear the agonized screams of kagerou oboro begged tenzen to cease his torture of her but found herself the target of his sadistic intentions as tenzen attempted to rape oboro a second time only to be interrupted by gennosuke who had come to rescue kagerou tenzen charged gennosuke and following a vicious duel through which tenzen had the advantage due to gennosuke s eyes still being sealed by the seven days of darkness gennosuke tricked tenzen into overextending himself which gave gennosuke the oppurtunity to decapitate him with his sword shortly afterward members of the takechiyo sect discovered tenzen s remains and put them back together but just as tenzen began to regenerate the seven days of darkness potion oboro had used on herself finally wore off and she stared at him with her mystic eyes with his technique being neutralized tenzen struggled against her until oboro greatly overpowered him and his head was blown into pieces finally killing tenzen once and for all but even though she was justified in doing so tenzen had manipulated the whole war between the clans used her feelings for gennosuke to lead him into a trap tortured kagerou to borderline death in front of her sacrificed innocent bystanders and even attempted to rape her twice oboro bitterly cried as she killed him in the manga right after that oboro dragged gennosuke s injured body behind a stair and waited for the arrival of lady kasuga managing to manipulate the situation into staging a fair last duel oboro vs gennosuke episode 24 the final battle of the series after being in the presence of hattori hanzo the 4th gennosuke and oboro stood facing each other on the banks of the same river their grandparents had killed each other on so as to finish the war between the clans oboro knew about this beforehand after she was approached by hanzo hattori s adopted son and right hand hattori kyouhachirou who provided her with the sword she d need to face gennosuke oboro knew however that she wouldn t be able to kill gennosuke so when the time came she stabbed herself through her chest with the sword that kyouhachirou gave her oboro s actions were not only a testimonial to her love for gennosuke despite all that had occured but was also an offering to the koga as compensation for those who had died as well as a way of striking back at the takechiyo sect for using her clan in its bid for power when gennosuke s eyes finally became unsealed oboro s dead body lying at his feet was the first thing he saw and he grieved deeply after enacting a small measure of retribution against okufu gennosuke wrote in blood that oboro was the survivor of the war thereby abdicating the koga s victory to the iga gennosuke then carried his lover s body into the river and fatally stabbed himself drifting away with oboro tightly clasped against him as the current bore them both to a place where they could finally be together for all eternity manga oboro in the anime is slightly more fatalistic mature and down to earth than her manga incarnation after learning of the hattori truce s nullification in the manga oboro decides that in order to show her regret to gennosuke for her clan s actions she will allow him to kill her and then wait for him in the afterlife in contrast oboro in the anime is doubtful that gennosuke would ever forgive her even if she allowed him to kill her but accepted it as her fate due to the devotion she felt for him as well as the hope her sacrifice would move him to not seek any further retribution upon her clan alternate information oboro is also featured as a character in the live action movie known as shinobi heart under blade being played by actress yukie nakama unlike her anime manga incarnation oboro in the film is both a capable fighter and gradually became less conflicted between her feelings for gennosuke and her duty to the iga following the deaths of all their comrades during their last duel gennosuke allows oboro to kill him in order to save their clans and keep their hope for peace later when tokugawa ieyasu sent troops to destroy the koga and iga villages oboro begs him to spare them blinding herself as a proof of her sincerity ieyasu accepts thus the villages are saved in the original novel oboro is described as having a face like the sun with large round mesmerizing eyes her personality is closer to the manga than the anime and comparatively speaking recieves noticeably less attention in the novel than either the manga or anime as with the manga and anime oboro lacks martial ability and her only skill is her mystic eyes

 id=756950 title martin documentation nonfiltered 1439 processed 1420 dbindex 1481454 martin documentation is a documentation methodology designed to provide different information about procedures depending on the audience and use of the document while also providing for procedure development procedure change and error correction in both procedures and their documentation martin documentation is intended both for documenting existing procedures and developing new ones implementation of a martin documentation project creating and maintaining martin documentation is a procedure and can therefore itself be described with martin documentation the first step in implementing a martin system is to create martin documents describing the documentation procedures for the particular organization i e workgroup factory or corporation however martin documentation recognizes that different procedures require different amounts and types of documentation at different times that procedures and their documentation change over time and procedures are created outside of formal frameworks this means that the procedures for creating the procedures and documentation can be very vague and informal at first e g a copy of this article and then grow as needed with the rest of the project framework martin documentation recognizes that procedures are created outside of any formal framework through the creativity of the human mind therefore a document describing a procedure can be a note scribbled on a piece of paper pre existing documentation from before the martin documentation project was started documentation from a vendor or any other source and the martin system allows all documents to be included within its framework the martin framework consists of a set of documents for each procedure the documents for a procedure can be thought of as a tree structure with a trunk branches and roots the same information is repeated in different places in the tree which suggests storing the information in a database where software can create documents as needed by gathering details from stored information and provide hyperlinks from one document to another trunk documents and branches documents making up the trunk formally describe the procedure as it should be performed documents at the top of the trunk the thinner documents describe the procedure in the least detail while documents at the bottom the thicker documents have the most detail each document in a trunk contains all the information in the document above it the trunk can be set up like an expanding outline and stored electronically with the different levels of documents being created from the outline as needed it may also be desirable to create documents that one could consider to be on the same level but have slightly different details e g for the same procedure performed with different equipment or at a different location suggested trunk levels indexing information e g document number catalog number department number project code etc some of this may be hidden when printing thicker documents be considered ancillary documents for the main document number or all of the indexing information may be ancillary to the title procedure title and possibly text descriptions of the indexing information short descriptions of the steps to be used by a trained person as a reminder and possibly headers for the steps described in the document below this should include procedures for preventing and detecting common errors detailed description of each step in the process this level or a variation of this level will most likely be used as the formal documentation when needed detailed description of each step with notes and explanations about particular situations and links to procedures for correcting errors above with explanations about why certain steps are done a particular way to be used as a guide when developing changes to procedures or creating a procedure on the fly for correcting an error branches each document on the trunk may be associated with ancillary documents which can be represented in a database as links to other information including other procedure documents root documents root documents can be pretty much anything having to do with the procedure often it will contain historical documents outside sources and documents about infrequent situations all procedures start out as root documents even if they only exist in the mind most procedures will become part of the martin system by inclusion as a root document this allows a procedure to be included by simply giving it a title and links to other documents in the system computer databases allow root documents to be stored electronically or may provide information for finding physical documents principles of martin documentation inclusion procedures and changes to procedures originate from outside the system and must be put into the martin system before they are lost people should be encouraged to record any ideas about a procedure in any form so that at the very least it may be included as a root document and available for future development all procedures start out as a procedure title or number attached to a root document some root documents may also be linked as ancillary documents to trunk documents procedures for including root documents should not be so complex as to discourage their inclusion and should instead be designed to encourage their inclusion for many procedures the root document may be all that is required for a very long time and an effort to create thicker trunk documents should not be considered a necessity expansion if it is necessary to create or change a trunk document the root documents existing trunk documents and existing ancillary documents are available as a resource it might be helpful to create a procedure document describing how to make the decision to expand the documentation of a procedure at what level a trunk document is created should depend on the nature of the need and the existing documentation for the particular procedure error prevention correction and detection procedures should include prevention detection and correction of errors procedures for correcting errors should not encourage people to leave errors uncorrected history martin documentation was inspired by the naturally occurring evolution of software documentation in free software projects originally described by jeffrey john martin endofarticle doc doc

 id=748253 title third wave feminism nonfiltered 1445 processed 1426 dbindex 1481460 third wave feminism is a term identified with several diverse strains of feminist activity and study beginning in the early 1990s the movement arose as a response to perceived failures of second wave feminism it was also a response to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second wave overview third wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems the second wave s essentialist definitions of femininity which according to the third wave often assumed a universal female identity and over emphasized the experiences of upper middle class white women a post structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality is also central to much of the third wave and helps to account for its heightened emphasis on the discursive power and fundamental ambiguity inherent in all gender terms and categories third wave theory usually encompasses queer theory women of color consciousness post colonial theory critical theory transnationalism ecofeminism and new feminist theory third wave feminists often focus on micropolitics writing about forms of gender expression and representation that are less explicitly political than their predecessors they also challenged the second wave s paradigm as to what is or is not good for females third wave in popular culture ideals and debates associated with third wave feminism were reflected in popular culture of the 1990s and 2000s some feminists see it as a cultural movement and trace its origin to the early 90 s riot grrrl movement see main article girl power history in the fall of 1991 president george h w bush nominated clarence thomas to the supreme court during the senate judiciary committee hearings anita hill an african american law professor from oklahoma came forward and said that she had been sexually harassed by thomas almost a decade earlier while she had been employed under him in response to the thomas hearings rebecca walker published an article titled becoming the third wave in a 1992 issue of ms in which she declared i am not a postfeminism feminist i am the third wave this event is often marked as the beginning of the usage of the term third wave applied to feminism the wave concept of social progress was floated by futurist alvin toffler in his 1980 book titled the third wave as amber kinser has argued walker s was a notable expansion of feminist space for women of color the roots of the third wave began however in the mid 1980 s feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like gloria anzaldua bell hooks chela sandoval cherrie moraga audre lorde maxine hong kingston and many other feminists of color called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice they sought to negotiate prominent space within feminist thought for consideration of race related subjectivities this focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the hill thomas hearings but began to shift with the freedom ride 1992 this drive to register voters in poor communities of color was surrounded with rhetoric that focused on rallying young feminists for many the rallying of the young is the emphasis that has stuck within third wave feminism dietary concerns some third wave feminists such as carol adams reject the consumption of meat and analogize the use and objectification of animals to the use and objectification of women in society this criticism focuses on societal construction of ties between women and the environment and references the fact that a large majority of

 id=1112756 title retirement plans in the united states nonfiltered 1450 processed 1430 dbindex 1481465 a retirement plan is an arrangement to provide people with an income possibly a pension during retirement when they are no longer earning a steady income from employment or an asset from which a person may draw an income from as needed there are significant though varied and complicated tax advantages for many types of retirement plans in passing the laws offering those advantages congress has expressed a desire to encourage plans that provide retirement security plans designed to replace a specific amount of steady income are known as defined benefit plans though exceptions do apply and those designed to accumulate as an asset without requiring a specified income are known as defined contribution plans retirement plans may be set up by employers insurance companies the government or other institutions such as employer associations or trade unions retirement plans have increased in importance and in being utilized by more of the us population over the last half century but especially since 1980 since 1980 and increasingly since 2000 there has been a shift from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans less and less defined benefit plans are being offered because they represent a large and not fully predictable cost to employers as of 2005 most defined benefit plans are offered by large and or governmental employers retirement plans are defined in tax terms by the irs code and most are also regulated by the department of labor s erisa provisions there are a wide variety of plans available and a very large amount of tax laws and regulations affecting them types of retirement plans retirement plans may be classified as defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the benefits are determined a defined benefit plan guarantees a certain payout after retirement according to a fixed formula which usually depends on the member s salary and the number of years membership of the plan in a defined contribution plan the payout is dependent upon the amount of money contributed and the performance of the investment vehicles utilized some types of retirement plans such as cash balance plans combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes defined contribution plans a defined contribution plan according to the internal revenue code section 414 are employer sponsored plans with an individual account for each employee the accrued benefit from such a plan for an employee must be solely attributed to contributions made into his individual account and investment gains less any losses and expense charges the contributions are invested for example in the stock market and the returns on the investment which may be positive or negative are credited to the individual s account on retirement the member s account is used to provide retirement benefits sometimes through the purchase of an annuity which provides a regular income defined contribution plans have become more widespread all over the world in recent years and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector in many countries for example the number of db plans in the us has been steadily declining as more and more employers see the large pension contributions as a large expense that they can avoid by disbanding the plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan examples of defined contribution plans include individual retirement accounts iras 401 k and profit sharing plans in such plans the employee is responsible to one degree or another for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated this may range from choosing one of a small number of pre determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other securities most self directed retirement plans are characterized by certain tax advantages and some provide for a portion of the employee s contributions to be matched by the employer in exchange the funds in such plans may not be withdrawn by the investor prior to reaching a certain age typically the year the employee reaches 59 5 years old with a small number of exceptions without incurring a substantial penalty money contributed can either be from employee salary deferral or from employer contributions or matching defined contribution plans are subject to irs limits on how much can be contributed known as the section 415 limit the total deferral amount including the employee and employer contribution is the lesser of 40 000 or 100 of compensation the employee only amount is 14 000 for 2004 with a 4 000 catch up these amounts increase in 2006 defined benefit plans the statutory definition of the defined benefit plan encompasses all pension plans that are not defined contribution i e that do not have individual accounts while this catchall definition has been interpreted by the courts to capture some hybrid pension plans like cash balance plans and pension equity plans pep traditional retirement plans by large businesses or for government workers by the government itself are in the form of the final salary plan under which the pension paid is equal to the number of years worked multiplied by the member s salary at retirement multiplied by a factor known as the accrual rate the cash balance plan with or without a formula that specifies an exact benefit at retirement whatever amount is accumulated can be available as a monthly pension at retirement or a lump sum at retirement and possibly before the only requirement is that it must provide a benefit in the form of a lifetime annuity at normal retirement age as required by the internal revenue code of all defined benefit plans the amount of the annuity benefit must be definitely determinable as per irs regulation 1 412 1 social security is a form of state sponsored retirement benefits beyond those provided by employers which are funded by payroll taxes defined benefit plans may be either funded or unfunded in a funded plan contributions from the employer and sometimes also from plan members are invested in a fund towards meeting the benefits the future returns on the investments and the future benefits to be paid are not known in advance so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will be enough to meet the benefits typically the contributions to be paid are regularly reviewed in a valuation of the plan s assets and liabilities carried out by an actuary in many countries such as the usa the uk and australia most private defined benefit plans are funded because governments there provide tax incentives to funded plans in an unfunded plan no funds are set aside the benefits to be paid are met immediately by contributions to the plan most government run retirement plans such as the social security system in the usa and most european countries are unfunded with benefits being paid directly out of current taxes and social security contributions in some countries such as germany austria and sweden company run retirement plans are often unfunded hybrid and cash balance plans hybrid plan designs combine the features of defined benefit and defined contribution plan designs in general they are usually treated as defined benefit plans for tax accounting and regulatory purposes as with defined benefit plans investment risk in hybrid designs is largely borne by the plan sponsor as with defined contribution designs plan benefits are expressed in the terms of a notional account balance and are usually paid as cash balances upon termination of employment these features make them more portable than traditional defined benefit plans and perhaps more attractive to a more highly mobile workforce a typical hybrid design is the cash balance plan where the employee s notional account balance grows by some defined rate of interest and annual employer contribution in the us plan conversions from traditional to hybrid plan designs have been controversial notably at ibm in the late 1990s upon conversion some plan sponsors retrospectively calculated employee account balances if the employee s actual vested benefit under the old design was more than the account balance the employee entered a period of wear away where he or she accrued no new benefits hybrid designs also typically eliminated the generous early retirement provisions in traditional pensions as a result critics of cash balance plans have seen the new designs as discriminatory against older workers on the other hand the new designs may better meet the needs of a modern workforce and actually encourage older workers to remain at work since benefit accruals continue at a constant pace as long as an employee remains on the job court cases have split on this issue and therefore not resolved these problems currently both the senate and house have legislation to clarify the legal status of future cash balance plans in the interim treasury has placed a moratorium on future determination letters on cash balance plans the proposed legislation on cash balance age discrimination much like the principle in criminal appeal that convicts convicted under the old procedure cannot win on appeal by applying the new rule retroactively us v teague 489 us 288 1989 does not cover the legal status of current plans in existence while the cash balance plan mentioned above is hybrid which is a defined benefit plan designed enable workers to evaluate the economic worth their pension benefit in the manner of a defined contribution plan the defined benefit design of cash balance plans provides the advantage of pbgc insurance but the risk of insolvency the target benefit plan is a defined contribution plan designed to express its projected impact in terms of lifetime income as a percent of final salary at retirement and targeted to match a defined benefit plan in a target benefit plan a typical defined benefit design say 1 5 of salary per year of service times the final 3 year average salary is used to provide the target actuarial assumptions like 5 interest 3 salary increases and the up84 life table for mortality are used to calculate a level flat contribution rate that would create the needed lump sum at retirement age 65 for each entering employee the problem with such target benefit dc plans is that the flat rate could be low for young entrants like 8 for a 21 year old and high for old entrants this may appear unfair but the skewing of benefits to the old worker is a feature of most traditional defined benefit plans and any attempt to match it would reveal this backloading feature this points out the key difference among dc and db plans for ordinary workers awareness the dc plan like the 401k is easy for workers to understand the value of while the db plan is typically undervalued by workers until they get really close to retirement age requirement of permanence to guard against tax abuse in the united states the internal revenue service irs has promulgated rules that require that pension plans be permanent as opposed to a temporary arrangement used to capture tax benefits regulation 1 401 1 b 2 states that hus although the employer may reserve the right to change or terminate the plan and to discontinue contributions thereunder the abandonment of the plan for any reason other than business necessity within a few years after it has taken effect will be evidence that the plan from its inception was not a bona fide program for the exclusive benefit of employees in general especially will this be true if for example a pension plan is abandoned soon after pensions have been fully funded for persons in favor of whom discrimination is prohibited the irs would have grounds to disqualify the plan retroactively even if the plan sponsor initially got a favorable determination letter determination letters like no action letters from the securities and exchange commission sec are advisory and to the extent the tax payer s actions have pandered the taxpayer is on the hook qualified retirement plans receive the normally discussed tax advantages and are regulated by erisa the technical definition of qualified does not agree with the commonly used distinction for example 403 b plans are not considered qualified plans but are treated and taxed almost identically simple iras sep iras hr 10 or keogh plans nonqualified plans plans that do not meet the guidelines required to receive the tax advantages that qualified plans do they are typically used to provide additional benefits to key or highly paid employees such as executives and officers without the restrictions that qualified plans carry most offer little or no tax advantages but are used for their flexibilty as incentives for key employees examples are serp supplemental executive retirement plans and 457 f plans for additional info see the constructive receipt theory and related doctrines of the cash equivalence and economic benefit as well as amend v commissioner 13 tax court 178 1949 pulsifer v commisioner irish sweepstakes 64 tax court 245 1975 and revenue ruling 60 31 contrasting types of retirement plans advocates of defined contribution plans point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation including the choice of how much to contribute if anything at all however others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts portability valuation because defined contribution plans have actual balances that workers can simply know the value of with certainty by simply checking the balance there is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an ira though it is relatively uncommon in the us not to allow this however because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker s vested accrued benefit is uncertain the irs in section 417 e of the internal revenue code specifies the interest and mortality that must be used this has caused some employers as in the berger versus xerox case in the 7th circuit richard a posner was the judge who wrote the opinion with cash balance plans to have a higher liability for employers for a lump sum than was in the employee s notional or hypothetical account balance when the interest credit rate exceeds the irs mandated section 417 e discounting rate the legally mandated lump sum value payable to the employee the plan sponsor allows for pre retirement lump sums would exceed the notional balance in the employee s cahs balance account this has been colourfully dubbed the whipsaw in actuarial parlance the current house of representatives version of the pension reform bill has a provision to liberalise the use of the 417 e discount rate to reduce the lump sum value and avoid the whipsaw however it must survive the conference committee with the version of the bill the senate has passed portability practical not a legal difference a practical difference is that a defined contribution plan s assets remain with the employee even if he or she transfers to a new job or decides to retire early whereas in many countries defined benefit pension benefits are typically lost if the worker fails to serve the requisite number of years with the same company self directed accounts from one employer may usually be rolled over to another employer s account or converted from one type of account to another in these cases because defined contribution plans have actual balances employers can simply write a check because the amount of their liability at termination of employment which may be decades before actual normal 65 retirement date of the plan is known with certainty there is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an ira though it is relatively uncommon in the us not to allow this just like there is no legal requirement to give portability to defined contribution plans there is no mandated ban on portability for defined benefit plans however because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker s vested accrued benefit is uncertain the irs mandate in section 417 e of the internal revenue code specfies the interest and mortality that must be used this uncertainty discussed in valuaton of defined benefit lump sums has limited the practical portality of defined benefit plans investment risk borne by employee or employer it is commonly said that the employee bears investment risk for defined contribution plans while the employer bears that risk in defined benefit plans this is true for practically all cases but pension law in the united states does not require that employees bear investment risk it only provides an erisa section 404 c exemption from fiduciary liability if the employer provides the mandated investment choices and gives employees sufficient control to customize his pension investment portfolio appropriate to his risk toleratnce pbgc insurance a legal difference erisa the employee retirement income security act does not provide insurance from the pbgc for defined contribution plans but cash balance plans do get such insurance because they like all erisa defined benefit plans are covered by the pbgc plans may also be either employer provided or individual plans most types of retirement plans are the former though individual plans known as iras or individual retirement accounts are very common tax advantages most retirement the exception being most non qualified plans plans offer significant tax advantages most commonly the money contributed to the account is not taxed as income to the employee but in the case of employer provided plans the employer is able to receive a tax deduction for the amount contributed as if it were regular employee compensation this is known as pre tax contributions and the amounts allowed to be contributed vary significantly among various plan types the other significant advantage is that the money in the plan is allowed to grow through investing without being taxed on the growth each year once the money is withdrawn it is taxed fully as income there are many restrictions on contributions especially with 401 k and defined benefit plans that are designed to make sure that highly compensated employees do not gain too much tax advantage at the expense of lesser paid employees currently two types of plan the roth ira and the newly introduced roth 401 k offer tax advantages that are essentially reversed from most retirement plans contributions to roth iras and roth 401 k s must be made with money that has been taxed as income but after meeting the

 id=1454083 title history of rail transport in australia nonfiltered 1490 processed 1469 dbindex 1481505 this article is part of the history of rail transport by country series following the british model australians generally assumed in the 1850s that railways would be built by the private sector private companies attempted to build railways in the colonies states after federation in 1901 of new south wales victoria and south australia the first line opened in south australia in 1854 as a horse drawn line while the first steam powered line opened in victoria a little later in 1854 it was soon established that the private railways were not financially viable and the building of rail networks was taken over by colonial governments this also enabled railways to be developed to promote development even if not apparently viable in strictly financial terms the railway systems spread from the colonial capitals except in cases where geography dictated a choice of an alternate port the colonial railways were built to three different gauges which became a problem once lines of different systems met at albury new south wales in 1881 and wallangarra queensland in 1888 in the 20th century the lines between major cities were converted to standard gauge and electrified suburban networks were built in sydney melbourne brisbane and perth in the second half of the 20th century many rural branch lines were closed to passengers or altogether in all states on the other hand long heavy haul railways were built to transport iron ore in western australia and coal in queensland to ports the development of the state networks australia s first steam powered railway was a suburban line opened from melbourne to port melbourne in 1854 this line and almost all subsequent victorian lines were built to broad gauge 1600 mm 5 3 gauge in the following year new south wales opened its first line standard gauge 1435mm 4 8 from sydney to granville in what is now sydney s western suburbs in the following year south australia opened its first line 1600 mm gauge from adelaide to port adelaide the three major australian colonies at the time failed to follow advice from the british government to adopt a uniform gauge in case the lines of the various states should ever meet the original irish engineer persuaded the new south wales legislature to require that all railways in the colony be of the irish broad gauge subsequently a scots engineer persuaded the legislature to change to standard gauge unfortunately victoria and south australia had ordered broad gauge rolling stock and refused to follow this change queensland first line 1067 mm 3 6 feet gauge known in australia as narrow gauge from ipswich to bigges camp the first stage of a railway between brisbane and toowoomba opened in 1865 this gauge was intended to save money and was subsequently followed by tasmania and western australia as a result in the middle of the 20th century australia had almost equal amounts of each gauge tasmania s first 1600 mm gauge line opened in 1871 from deloraine to launceston and was converted to 1067 mm gauge in 1888 finally western australia opened its first government owned line in 1879 between geraldton and northampton lines spread in all the states from these first lines connecting ports to farmland and ports the mainline systems of new south wales victoria south australia and queensland met albeit with three breaks of gauge in the 1880s only victoria and south australia shared a common gauge and even so they opted to change engines at the border the other mainland colony western australia was isolated by 2 000 km of desert the first break of gauge was created when the new south wales and victorian lines met at albury in 1883 the railways of victoria and south australia meet at serviceton in 1887 but these lines were both broad gauge in 1888 the railways of new south wales and queensland meet at wallangara meanwhile in 1889 the first line 1067 mm gauge in the northern territory was opened from darwin to pine creek in 1915 a seven kilometre extension of the new south railways from queanbeyan to canberra to create the australian capital territory s first and only line new south wales new south wales railways were standard gauge lines built to connect the ports of sydney and newcastle to the rural interior the first railway was built from sydney to parramatta junction and after two decisions to change the rail gauge problems in raising capital and difficulties in construction the line was opened in 1854 the main southern line was built in stages from parramatta junction to the victorian border at albury between 1855 and 1881 and connected to the victorian railways at a break of gauge in 1883 the standard gauge connection from albury to melbourne was finally completed in 1962 meanwhile the main western line was built from parramatta junction line to the north west of the state reaching bourke between 1860 and 1885 the main north line was built from newcastle to wallangarra on the queensland border and connecting with queensland railway s line to brisbane at a break of gauge between 1857 and 1888 sydney and newcastle was finally connected in 1889 the shorter and single gauge north coast railway line between sydney and brisbane was completed between 1905 and 1932 the last main line the broken hill line was completed to broken hill in 1927 connecting with the south australian railways at a break of gauge in 1970 the south australian section was standardised completing the sydney perth standard gauge link meanwhile branch lines proliferated over the settled east of the state including the illawarra line to wollongong and nowra completed in 1893 in 1926 work began on electrifying sydney s urban railways and connecting them together via new lines victoria victoria s first railway was a suburban railway opened by the melbourne and hobson s bay railway company from melbourne to sandridge now port melbourne in 1854 this line and almost all subsequent lines were built to broad gauge 1600 mm the melbourne and suburban railway company s line from princes bridge railway station to punt road richmond opened in 1859 in the same year the geelong and melbourne railway company opened its line from melbourne to geelong subsequently up to 1925 victorian railways built new railways to connect farming and mining communities to the ports of melbourne geelong and portland in 1862 lines reaches the great gold rush towns of bendigo and ballarat in 1864 a line was opened to the murray river port of echuca in 1883 the first connection with another state s rail system was made when a line was completed to the new south wales government railways s station at albury requiring a break of gauge to new south wales s standard gauge 1435mm in 1887 victorian railways met south australian railways at serviceton although both systems used broad gauge in 1888 the gippsland line reached bairnsdale the next year a direct line from melbourne to ballarat opened avoiding geelong in the early 20th century rural lines were completed to mildura 1903 and tocumwal 1908 in 1919 electrification and development of the melbourne suburban lines commenced in 1981 melbourne s only underground railway the melbourne city loop was opened the main interstate links were finally standardised melbourne to albury connecting to sydney in 1961 and melbourne to adelaide in 1995 queensland the first line opened in 1865 from ipswich to grandchester a temporary terminus in the foothills of the darling downs it was built to narrow gauge 1067mm 3 6 in order to reduce costs through the steep escarpment this was subsequently applied to all the railways built in queensland except for the brisbane sydney standard gauge line and the weipa mining railway both built in the 20th century this was the first 1067mm railway in the world but the gauge subsequently spread to western australia south australia tasmania new zealand japan indonesia southern africa nigeria and ghana among others the line was extended from grandchester to toowoomba at the top of a steep climb in 1867 and was connected from ipswich to brisbane in 1876 from toowoomba it was extended in stages to meet the new south wales standard gauge line at wallangarra in 1887 and to charleville in outback southern queensland in 1888 independent lines were commenced from the east coast ports of maryborough bundaberg gladstone rockhampton mackay bowen townsville cairns and cooktown the central line opened from rockhampton to westwood in 1887 and reached winton in central western queensland in 1928 the northern line opened from townsville to charters towers in 1882 and reached mount isa in 1929 in 1888 the east west lines began to be connected with the opening of the first section of the north coast line to petrie it was not until 1924 that this line finally reached cairns cooktown was never connected the interstate standard gauge line completed as far as grafton new south wales in 1930 and sydney in 1932 a mixed gauge freight only branch of this line was opened to the port of brisbane in 1995 many heavy haul coal lines were built in the late 20th century from the ports of gladstone beginning in 1968 and hay point beginning in 1971 electrification of some of the heavy haul coal lines commenced in 1986 finally an electrified rail system was developed in suburban brisbane from 1979 eventually the the north coast line between brisbane and rockhampton was electrified this together with the central queensland mining railway constitutes australia s only significant rural rail electrification western australia the first railway in western australia was a private timber railway opens from lockville to yoganup south of perth in 1879 western australian government railways opened a 1067 mm 3 ft 6 in gauge to connect the copper mine at northampton and the port of geraldton subsequently lines also developed from the ports of fremantle the port of perth bunbury albany and esperance mainly for carrying grain and minerals the line between fremantle perth and guildford about 15km further east was opened in 1881 in 1893 perth was connected to the port of bunbury 175 kilometres south of perth in the following year the midland railway company opened a line from perth to walkaway which connected with the government line to geraldton 424 km north of perth in 1896 the railway connected perth to kalgoorlie where gold had been discovered in 1893 in the 20th century perth was finally connected to the eastern states in 1917 the standard gauge trans australian railway connected eastern australia with the narrow gauge network at kalgoorlie in 1966 a new mixed standard and narrow gauge eastern railway route was completed through the avon valley east of perth finally in 1968 the kalgoorlie to perth standard gauge line was opened the rationalisation of non paying branch lines started in 1957 with the closure of many lines commencing in the 1960s a number of long distance heavy haul railways have been built in the pilbara region by major iron mining companies particularly bhp billiton and hamersley iron new lines are still being built in this area particularly to supply the booming chinese market in 1986 the electrification of perth suburban lines with a 25 kv ac overhead power supply commenced the longest new line is currently under construction to mandurah and is due to be opened in july 2007 south australia south australia was the first colony in australia to build a railway line it was a horse drawn tramway from the port of goolwa on the murray river to an ocean harbour at port elliot in 1854 it was later extended to a safer harbour at victor harbor the first south australian steam operated line was built as a broad gauge 1600 mm line in 1856 between the city and port adelaide stopping at bowden woodville and alberton gradually a network of lines spread out from adelaide port wakefield wallaroo port broughton port augusta kingston se beachport whyalla port pirie and port lincoln some of these were built initially to carry ore particularly copper they later carried freight from the murray river and grain from the broadacre lands all but the lines radiating from adelaide were initially narrow 1067 mm gauge lines the first narrow gauge line was completed in 1870 from port wakefield to hoyleton the first interstate connection was completed in 1887 when the south australian and victorian broad gauge railways met at serviceton victoria in 1888 a narrow gauge line was opened from port pirie to broken hill new south wales with a connection at peterborough to adelaide in 1927 this became an interstate link with the opening of the final leg of the sydney broken hill standard gauge line between trida and menindee the broad gauge line was completed from adelaide to terowie in 1880 the line north of terowie was built as a narrow gauge line in stages to peterborough in 1881 quorn in 1882 and oodnadatta in 1891 this was extended to alice springs by commonwealth railways in 1929 when it was renamed the central australia railway the first standard gauge line in south australia trans australian railway was completed in 1917 between port augusta and kalgoorlie western australia requiring break of gauges at terowie port augusta and kalgoorlie to reach perth this line was extended to port pirie in 1937 and the broad gauge line from adelaide to redhill was extended to port pirie removing one break of gauge in 1970 the port pirie to broken hill standard gauge line was opened completing the sydney perth link in 1982 adelaide was connected to the standard gauge network at crystal brook south australia near port pirie meanwhile in 1980 the tarcoola south australia to alice springs standard gauge railway was opened replacing the narrow gauge line via oodnadatta it was extended to darwin in 2003 in 1995 the adelaide to melbourne standard gauge railway was opened completing the connections between the mainland capitals tasmania the first railway in tasmania was a broad gauge 1600 mm line opened between deloraine and launceston in 1871 by the launceston and western railway it quickly went bankrupt and was effectively teken over by the tasmanian government in 1872 in 1876 the tasmanian main line company opened a narrow gauge 1067 mm line from hobart to evandale near launceston connecting with an extension of the launceston and western line at a break of gauge further gauge confusion was added in 1885 when the tasmanian government built a narrow gauge line west of deloraine to devonport this was resolved in 1888 by the conversion of the launceston deloraine line to narrow gauge the tasmanian government bought the tasmanian main line company in 1890 creating the tasmanian government railways in 1901 the line to devonport line was extended to burnie connecting with the emu bay railway s line to zeehan other branches were built but the tasmanian system has always been small and unprofitable it currently carries no regular passenger services and its freight services are not profitable without subsidies for the maintenance and upgrading of its infrastructure which is currently controlled by pacific national off network gauges off the networks constructed by the various government railways there have been a variety of rail gauges cane tramways mainly in queensland are 2 0 but these carry very little through traffic so that the break of gauge is not a problem victoria had four short 2 6 lines for general traffic private timber tramways used a variety of gauges private isolated and heavy duty iron ore mining railways all use the standard gauge of 4 8 temporary lines at construction sites such as the 3 6 gauge railways used for the development of the national capital at canberra between 1913 and 1927 including the original parliament house development of the national network in the 19th century railways were created to enable agricultural and minerals traffic to be carried to ports for export and to allow passenger and freight operations between colonial capitals and regional areas coastal shipping handled most passenger and freight traffic between the colonies however the problem of different gauges became apparent with the meeting of lines of the different systems at albury in 1881 and wallangarra in 1888 in the 1890s the establishment of an australian federation from the six colonies was debated one of the points of discussion was the extent that railways would be a federal responsibility a vote to make it so was lost narrowly instead the new constitution allows the acquisition with the consent of a state of any railways of the state on terms arranged between the commonwealth and the state section 51 xxxiii and railway construction and extension in any state with the consent of that state section 51 xxxiv however the australian government is free to provide funding to the states for rail upgrading projects under section 96 the parliament may grant financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit the australian government has full responsibility for railways in the federal territories although the northern territory s railway is now owned and operated by the private australasia rail corporation and the only railway in the australian capital territory the canberra queanbeyan railway is now operated by the rail corporation new south wales in 1910 a conference of railway commissioners chose 4 8 to be the standard gauge over the decades many plans were floated to fix the break of gauge these failed mainly because they were too ambitious and proposed to convert all lines even lines of little economic value creating a standard gauge network in the 20th century the different state rail systems became more integrated initially creating more breaks of gauge in 1917 the federal goverment s standard gauge trans australian railway was completed between kalgoorlie western australia and port augusta south australia however this required a break of gauge at kalgoorlie to reach perth and breaks of gauge at both port augusta and and terowie to reach adelaide in 1927 the last section of the sydney broken hill line was completed meeting the south australian railways line at a break of gauge and requiring a further break of gauge at terowie to reach adelaide in 1932 the first progress in reducing the gauge conflict was made with the completion of the standard gauge north coast line from sydney to brisbane with the opening of a bridge at grafton in 1937 the trans australian railway was extended to port pirie and the broad gauge railway from adelaide to redhill was extended to port pirie reducing one break of gauge between adelaide and perth but creating a three gauge railway station until the standadisation of the line to broken hill and the adelaide crystal brook line in the 1950s a parliamentary committee chaired by william charles wentworth iv recommended a much more modest and affordable plan to gauge convert the three main missing links albury sydney to melbourne standard gauge track added parallel to broad gauge completed 1962 kalgoorlie to perth narrow gauge converted to standard completed 1968 broken hill to port pirie narrow gauge converted to standard completed 1969 a standard gauge line was built between port augusta and whyalla in 1972 in october 1980 a new standard gauge railway was completed from tarcoola south australia to alice springs replacing the former narrow gauge railway standardisation between adelaide and crystal brook south australia connecting to the sydney perth standard gauge line was completed in 1982 in 1962 the albury to melbourne standard gauge railway was opened completing the standard gauge link between the two biggest cities sydney and melbourne in 1968 and 1969 the kalgoorlie to perth and the broken hill to port pirie standard gauge railway were opened completing the sydney perth link adelaide was connected to the standard gauge network with the opening of the line to crystal brook south australia in 1982 and the adelaide to melbourne line was converted to standard gauge in 1995 meanwhile the tarcoola south australia to alice springs standard gauge railway was opened in 1980 and extended to darwin in 2004 private railways there have always been niches for private railways in most colonies such as mining private iron mining railways alone now account for most austrlalian rail freight by tonnage but private coal railways have been important since the ealy years of coal mining in the mid 19th century quarrying major factory sites such as steel works temporary lines at construction sites agriculture especially the sugar industry mining railways starting in the 1960s four heavy duty railways were developed in the pilbara region of the far north of western australia for the haulage of iron ore from several mines to the nearest ports these railways are isolated from each other and from the national system carrying no other traffic the very heavy traffic on these lines up to 100mt per year push wheel rail technology to its limits and has resulted in considerable research and development that has been of value to railways worldwide these iron ore railways are all 1435mm gauge

to take over the 1067mm gauge railways between port augusta and oodnadatta used by the old ghan and the palmerston and pine creek railway commonwealth railways became part of the australian national railways commission in 1975 which was privatised in 1997 although the australian government has considered the funding of railways owned by state government to be a state responsibility it has made loans to the states for gauge standardisation projects from the 1920s to the 1970s from the 1970s to 1996 the australian government has provided some grant funding to the states for rail projects one

 id=3229 title outback nonfiltered 1498 processed 1477 dbindex 1481513 the outback is the remote and arid interior and north of australia although the term colloquially can cover any lands outside of the main urban areas the term outback is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas deemed the bush the outback does not officially exist within any governmental frameworks or boundaries many local government shires do use the term to enhance tourist appeal for their own shire the outback is home to the australian feral camel and dingoes the dingo fence was built to restrict dingo movements into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent the marginally fertile parts mainly within the lake eyre basin are known as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle farming on sheep stations and cattle stations which are leased from the federal government whereas these grassy areas have fairly fertile clay soils the remainder of the outback has exceedingly infertile paleosols which cannot support fodder nutritious enough for the economic raising of stock although the north of australia has high if extremely seasonal and fairly reliable rainfall giving it almost all the continent s runoff the soils there are so poor and eroded consisting mainly of ironstone or bauxite as to make cropping impossible even with fertilisers such as superphosphate mining along with agriculture tourism and mining are the main economic activities in this vast and sparsely settled area due to the complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the permian in many areas since the cambrian the outback is extremely rich in iron aluminium manganese and uranium ores and also contains major deposits of gold nickel lead and zinc ores because of its size the value of grazing and mining is considerable population less than 10 percent of the australian population lives outside the urban settlements on the coastal fringes despite this the outback and the history of its exploration and settlement provides australians with a mythical backdrop and stories of swagmen squatters outlaws such as ned kelly though ned kelly spent virtually all his time in the relatively temperate great dividing range and so on are central to the national ethos of the country the song waltzing matilda which is about swagmen and squatters is a popular traditional australian song medicine in the outback due to the wide expanses and remoteness of people in the outback the flying doctor service exists this service was created in 1928 in cloncurry queensland the aim of the service is to provide medical care primary and emergency to people who cannot reach hospitals or general practitioners consultations are carried out via radio or telephone and for serious situations doctors are flown out to patients terminology culturally many urban australians have had very generalised terms for the otherwise complex range of environments that exist within the inland and tropical regions of the continent regional terminology can be very specific to specific locations in each mainland state it is colloquially said that the outback is located beyond the black stump the location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore it has been suggested that the term comes from the black stump wine saloon that once stood about 10 kilometres out of coolah new south wales on the gunnedah road it is claimed that the saloon named after the nearby black stump run and black stump creek was an important staging post for traffic to north west new south wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys the never never is a term referring to remoter parts of the australian outback the outback can be also referred to as back of beyond back o bourke although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere or a long way away the well watered north of the continent is often called the top end and the arid interior the centre tourism there are many popular tourist attractions in the outback these include alice springs birdsville uluru ayers rock coober pedy devils marbles katherine river gorge kakadu national park kings canyon watarrka the olgas kata tjuta macdonnell ranges mount isa australian stockman s hall of fame monkey mia broome mount augustus national park organised travel to the outback is popular although some australian and international tourists travel in their own vehicles such a trip particularly once off the few bitumen roads in the outback requires considerable advance planning and a suitable vehicle usually a four wheel drive on remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required this can include prearranged caches some trips cannot be undertaken safely with a single vehicle instead requiring a convoy approach deaths from tourists and locals becoming stranded

brahman god is called bhagavan bhagavan is a word used to refer to the personal aspect of god in general it is not specific to a particular deity bhagavan transcends gender yet can be looked upon as both father and mother child or sweetheart most hindus in their daily devotional practices worship some form of this personal aspect of god although they believe in the more abstract concept of brahman as well sometimes this means worshiping god through an image or a picture sometimes it just means thinking of god as a personal being depending on which aspect of one is talking about a different name will be used and frequently a different image or picture for instance when god is talked about in the aspect as the creator god is called brahma when referred to in the capacity as preserver of the world god is called vishnu when referred to in the capacity as destroyer of the world god is called shiva many of these individual aspects of god also have other names and images for example krishna and rama are considered forms of vishnu all the various deities and images one finds in hinduism are considered manifestations of the same god called in the personal aspect and brahman when referred to as an abstract concept in their personal religious practices hindus worship primarily one or another of these deities known as their ishta devat or chosen idol the particular form of god worshipped as one s chosen ideal is a matter of individual preference regional and family traditions can play a large part in influencing this choice hindus may also take guidance about this choice from their scriptures although hindus may worship deities other than their chosen idol from time to time as well depending on the occasion and their personal inclinations it is not expected that they will worship or even know about every form of god hindus generally choose one concept of god e g krishna rama shiva or kali and cultivate devotion to that chosen form while at the same time respecting the chosen ideals of other people devas devis the hindu religion speaks of many individual deities called devas goddesses are called dev s the various devas and dev s are personifications of various aspects of one and the same god ishvara for instance when a hindu thinks of ishvara as the giver of knowledge and learning that aspect of ishvara is personified as the deity saraswati in the same manner the deity lakshmi personifies ishvara as the giver of wealth and prosperity this does not imply that ishvara is the lord of all the other deities ishvara is just the name used to refer to the personal god in general when no particular deity is being referred to the devas also called constitute an integral part of the colorful hindu culture these various forms of god are depicted in innumerable paintings statues murals and scriptural stories that can be found in temples homes businesses and other places in hinduism the scriptures recommend that for the satisfaction of a particular material desire a person may worship a particular deity for example shopkeepers frequently keep a statue or picture of the devi lakshmi in their shops the elephant headed deva known as ganesha is worshipped before commencing any undertaking as he represents god s aspect as the remover of obstacles students and scholars may propitiate saraswati the devi of learning before taking an exam or giving a lecture the most ancient vedic devas included indra agni soma varuna mitra savitri rudra prajapati vishnu aryaman and the ashvins important were sarasvati ushas and prithvi later scriptures called the puranas recount traditional stories about each individual deity and shiva are not regarded as ordinary devas but as great gods because of their central positions in worship and mythology the puranas also laud other devas such as ganesha and hanum n and avatar such as rama and krishna see below goddesses are worshiped when god is thought of as the universal mother particular forms of the universal mother include lakshmi sarasvati and parvati durga and kali there are some hindus who consider the various deities not as forms of the one ishwara but as independently existing entities and may thus be properly considered polytheistic to some extent avataras incarnations of god many denominations of hinduism such as vaishnavism and smartism teach that from time to time god comes to earth as a human being to help humans along in their struggle toward enlightenment and salvation moksha such an incarnation of god is called an avat ra in some respects the hindu concept of avatara is similar to the belief found in christianity that god came to the earth in the form of jesus however whereas most christians believe that god has assumed a human body on only one occasion hinduism teaches that there have been multiple avatars throughout history and that there will be more in the future thus krishna who is not only viewed as an incaranation but also source of all incarnations says whenever righteousness declines and unrighteousness increases i make myself a body in every age i come back to deliver the holy to destroy the sin of the sinner to establish righteousness the most famous of the divine incarnations are rama whose life is depicted in the ramayana and krishna whose life is depicted in the mahabharata and the srimad bhagavatam the bhagavad gita which contains the spiritual teachings of krishna is one of the most widely read scriptures in hinduism trimurti in hinduism the trimurti also called the hindu trinity are three aspects of god in his forms as brahma vishnu and shiva brahma the creator vishnu the preserver shiva the destroyer popular gods some other popular hindu aspects of god include devi krishna ganesh hanuman murugan ramachandra and lakshmi smarta hindus believe that god in whatever form they prefer ishta devata i e the preferred form of god can grant worshippers grace to bring them closer to moksha end of the cycle of rebirth the great hindu saint ramakrishna studied and embraced other religions such as christianity and islam and came to the same conclusion proclaimed by the vedas truth is one the wise call it by various names ekam sat viprah bahuda vadanti denominations of hinduism contemporary hinduism traditionally has four major divisions saivism shaktism vaishnavism and smarthism according to adherents com there are 580 000 000 vaishnavas 220 000 000 shaivites and 22 000 000 neo hindus and reform hindus however the shakti sect connects god as lord shiva also as the aparabrahm while shakti is the parabrahm further the saura sect connects itself with lord vishnu one of the 12 adityas solar deities ganesha worshippers would connect themselves with lord shiva as lord shiva is the father of lord ganesha and hence lord ganesha is a shaiv deity hinduism is a very rich and complex religion each of its four denominations shares rituals beliefs traditions and personal gods with one another but each sect have a same and different philosophy on how to achieve life s ultimate goal moksa liberation for example a person can be a shiv devotee and a vishnu devotee but they can practice the advaita vedanta philosophy darshana which believes there is no difference between the brahman and the soul conversely a hindu may follow the dvaita philosophy which stresses that brahman and the soul are not the same but each denomination fundamentally believes in different methods of self realisation and in different aspects of the one supreme god however each denomination respects and accepts all others and conflict of any kind is rare vaishnavism saivism and shaktism respectively believe in a monotheistic ideal of vishnu often as krishna shiva or devi this view does not exclude other personal gods as they are understood to be aspects of the chosen ideal e g to many devotees of krishna shiva is seen as having sprung from krishna s creative force often the monad brahman is seen as the one source with all other gods emanating therefrom thus with all hindus there is a strong belief in all paths being true religions that lead to one god or source whatever one chooses to call the ultimate truth even vaisnavites like other hindus have tolerance for other beliefs because lord krishna avatar of vishnu said so in the gita krishna said i am in everyone s heart as the supersoul as soon as one desires to worship some demigod i make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity endowed with such a faith he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires but in actuality these benefits are bestowed by me alone gita 7 21 22 another quote in the gita states those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only me o son of kunt but they do so in a wrong way gita 9 23 even a vedic verse illustrates this theme of tolerance the vedas are revered in hinduism regardless of denomination for example a well known rig vedic hymn stemming from hinduism states that truth is one though the sages know it variously this is in contrast with some other religious traditions where one must believe in only one form of god and to totally reject or disdain other beliefs polytheistic gods although the pantheistic system allowed only a subordinate rank to the old polytheistic gods and the actual religious belief of the people was probably but little affected by their existence they continued to occupy an important place in the affections of the poet and were still represented as exercising considerable influence on the destinies of man the most prominent of them were regarded as the appointed loka palas or guardians of the world and as such they were made to preside over the four cardinal and according to some authorities the intermediate points of the compass thus indra the chief of the devas was regarded as the regent of the east agni the fire was in the same way associated with the southeast yama lord of death and justice with the south surya the sun with the southwest varuna originally the representative of the all embracing heaven atmosphere now the god of the ocean with the west vayu or pavana the wind with the northwest kubera the god of wealth with the north and soma with the northeast note in some traditions na an aspect of siva is regarded as the regent of the northeast and nirrti the regent of the southwest in the institutes of manu the loka palas are represented as standing in close relation to the ruling king who is saki to be composed of particles of these his tutelary deities the retinue of indra consists chiefly of the devas angels gandharvas a class of genii considered in the epics as the celestial musicians and apsaras lovely nymphs who are frequently employed by the gods to make the pious devotee desist from carrying his austere practices to an extent that might render him dangerous to their power narada an ancient sage probably a personification of the cloud the water giver is considered as the messenger between the gods and men and as having sprung from the forehead of brahma the interesting office of the god of love is held by kamadeva also called ananga the bodyless because as the myth relates having once tried by the power of his mischievous arrow to make siva fall in love with parvati whilst he was engaged in devotional practices the urchin was reduced to ashes by a glance of the angry god two other mythological figures of some importance are considered as sons of siva and parvati viz karttikeya or skanda the leader of the heavenly armies who was supposed to have been fostered by the six knittikas or pleiades and ganesha lord of troops the elephant headed god of wisdom and at the same time the leader of the dii minorum gentium smartism smartism a denomination of hinduism is a monist as well as a monotheist religion that understands different deities as representing various aspects and principles of one supreme entity brahman or parabrahman teachers such as swami vivekananda who brought hinduism to the west held beliefs like those found in smartism although he usually referred to his religion as vedanta other denominations of hinduism do not strictly hold this belief a smartist would have no problem worshiping shiva or vishnu together as he views the different aspects of god as leading to the same one god it is the smarta view that dominates the view of hinduism in the west by contrast a vaishnavite considers vishnu as the one true god worthy of worship and other forms as subordinate see for example an illustration of the vaishnavite view of vishnu as the one true god at this link accordingly many vaishnavites for example believe that only vishnu can grant the ultimate aim for mankind moksha see for example this link similarly many shaivites also hold similar beliefs as illustrated at at this link and at this link devas in the vedas the pantheon in the rauta tradition consists of various gods and goddesses however these entities may not hold the traditional meaning of gods and goddesses in english instead the devas which is the sanskrit word used to represent these entities represent certain forces for instance the deva agni has one aspect as the flame but this flame symbolises the psychological power associated with agni namely the power of will agni can be called god will similarly indra is the god mind sarasvati is the power of inspiration not merely of learning the main devas are vide 6th anuvaka of chamakam agni indra soma savitr vayu varuna marutas

to cover her breasts to judge by the number of copies that have been excavated on roman sites in italy and france this variant on venus seems to have been popular a number of examples of the crouching venus in prominent collections have influenced modern sculptors since giambologna and have been drawn by artists since martin heemskerck who made a drawing of the farnese crouching venus that is now
