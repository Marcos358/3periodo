 id=79195 title history of sumer nonfiltered 1 processed 1 dbindex 450000 the history of sumer taken to include the prehistoric ubaid and uruk periods spans the 5th to 3rd millennia bc ending with the downfall of the third dynasty of ur around 2004 bc followed by a transition period of amorite states before the rise of babylonia in the 18th century bc the sumerians claimed that their civilisation had been brought fully formed to the city of eridu possibly from dilmun later identified with bahrain by their god enki or by his advisor or abgallu from ab water gal great lu man adapa u an the oannes of berossus this claim may be in part based upon fact as eridu was then on the coastline of the persian gulf and was the oldest city of southern mesopotamia the list of sumerian kings contains a traditional list of the early dynasties however much of it is likely mythical and only a few of the early names have been authenticated through archaeology the best known dynasty that of lagash is not listed there at all periodization all date ranges are approximate ubaid period 5300 4100 bc pottery neolithic to chalcolithic uruk period 4100 3000 bc late chalcolithic to early bronze age i uruk

early bronze age iv ur iii period 2150 2000 bc earliest city states it is difficult to identify what other than the development of irrigation may have inspired urban settlement the centres of eridu and uruk two of the earliest cities had successively elaborated large temple complexes built of mudbrick developing as small shrines with the earliest settlements by the early dynastic i period they had become the most imposing structures in their respective cities each dedicated to its own respective god from south to north the principal ones were eridu abzu temple enki ur e nunmah temple nanna moon uruk eanna temple inanna lagash e ninnu temple ningirsu nippur ekur temple enlil shuruppak ninlil wife of enlil marad ninurta kish ninhursag sippar utu sun e kishnugal dumuzi historians until recently agreed that before 3000 bc the political life of the city was headed by a priest king ensi and based around these temples but some more recent authors have asserted that the cities had secular rulers from the earliest times the development of a sophisticated system of administration led to the invention of writing of numbers about 3500 bc pictographic writing about 3100 bc and syllabic writing about 2600 bc early dynastic period archaeologists divide the early history of sumer into three periods early dynastic i dated to the period before ca 3000 bc early dynastic ii ca 3000 2560 bc early dynastic iii ca 2560 2320 bc no inscriptions have yet been found verifying any names of kings that can be associated with the early dynastic i period the sumerian king list portrays the passage of power over time from the south to the north of the country before finishing with a description of a universal flood archaeologists have confirmed the presence of a widespread layer of riverine silt deposits shortly after the priora oscillation interrupting the sequence of settlement centred on the city of shuruppak and extending as far as kish 1st dynasty of kish inscriptions have been found bearing some early dynastic ii names from the king list after the flood kingship is said to have resumed at kish under the reign of a king etana this first name on the list accompanied by any additional detail is that of etana whom it calls the shepherd who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries he was estimated by roux to have lived approximately 3000 bc of the 11 kings that followed over a period assumed to have been about 350 years a number of semitic akkadian names are recorded suggesting that these people made up a sizable proportion of the population of this northern city the first monarch on the list whose historical existence has been independently attested through archaeological finds is enmebaragesi of kish ca 2700 bc 22nd king of that dynasty said to have conquered elam and built the temple of enlil in nippur his successor agga is said to have fought with gilgamesh of uruk the 5th king of that city from this time for a period uruk seems to have had some kind of hegemony in sumer this illustrates a weakness of the sumerian kinglist as contemporaries are often placed in successive dynasties making reconstruction difficult 1st dynasty of uruk meshkiagkashar is listed as the first king of uruk he was followed by enmerkar claimed by david rohl as having been nimrod the hunter mentioned in the bible as founding erech the epic enmerkar and the lord of aratta tells of his voyage by river to aratta often considered an early form of the name urartu but believed by some iranian archaeologists to have been a reference to the newly discovered jiroft civilization although it cannot be reached by river from sumer amongst the kings of uruk who followed are dumuzi the shepherd who also appears in mythology as the husband and consort of inanna of uruk goddess of that city he was followed by a lugalbanda the most famous monarch of this dynasty was gilgamesh hero of the epic of gilgamesh copies of which have been found in hattusas in anatolia megiddo in israel and tell el amarna in egypt 1st dynasty of ur meskalamdug is the first recorded king lugal from lu man gal great of the city of ur another king named on the list mesannepada of ur seems through archaeological evidence to have succeeded his grandfather meskalamdug and father akalamdug mesannepada is recognised as the first king of early dynastic iii phase defeating lugalkildu of uruk ca 2560 bc and mesilim of kish founder of the short lived 2nd dynasty of that city mesannepada thereafter assumed the title king of kish for himself a title that seems to have been used by most kings of the preeminent dynasties for some time afterward en hegal is recorded as the first known ruler of lagash being tributary to uruk his successor lugal shag egur was similarly tributary to the first dynasty of ur mesalim founder of the 2nd dynasty of kish achieved some kind of independence of these dynasties mesilim was also mentioned in some of the earliest monuments from lagash that claim he arbitrated a border dispute between lugal shag engur high priest of lagash and the high priest of their traditional rival the neighbouring town of umma the sumerian records also show nin kasalsi as the first ruler of the city of adab at about this time like the later king of the 3rd dynasty of kish nin kasalsi was a woman shortly thereafter sumerian records begin for a dynasty of rulers of the city of mari far to the north dynasty of lagash ur nina at about 2494 bc ur nina also called ur nanshe the new high priest of lagash achieved independence from a annepadda son of mesannepada of ur and made himself king founding a dynasty he succeeded lugal shag ekur as high priest in the ruins of a building attached by him to the temple of nina terra cotta bas reliefs of the king and his sons have been found as well as lions heads in onyx reminiscent of egyptian work and onyx plates these were booty dedicated to the goddess bau one inscription states that ships of dilmun bahrain brought him wood as tribute from foreign lands he was succeeded by his son akurgal in about 2465 bc eannatum eannatum grandson of ur nina made himself master of the whole of the district of sumer together with the cities of uruk ruled by enshakushanna of the king list ur nippur akshak and larsa he also annexed the kingdom of kish however it recovered its independence after his death umma was made tributary a certain amount of grain being levied upon each person in it that had to be paid into the treasury of the goddess nina and the god ingurisa the so called stele of the vultures now in the louvre was erected as a monument of the victory of eannatum of lagash over enakalle of umma on this various incidents in the war are represented in one scene the king stands in his chariot with a curved weapon in his right hand formed of three bars of metal bound together by rings while his kilted followers with helmets on their heads and lances in their hands march behind him eannatum s campaigns extended beyond the confines of sumer he overran a part of elam took the city of az on the persian gulf and exacted tribute as far as mari however many of the realms he conquered were often in revolt during his reign temples and palaces were repaired or erected at lagash and elsewhere the town of nina that probably gave its name to the later niniveh was rebuilt and canals and reservoirs were excavated en anna tum he was succeeded by his brother en anna tum i during his rule umma once more asserted independence under ur lumma who attacked lagash unsuccessfully ur lumma was replaced by a priest king illi who also attacked lagash akshak too achieved independence with a line of rulers extending from puzur nirah 2420 2400 ishu il 2400 2360 and shu sin c2360 son of ishu il before being defeated by the rulers of kish entemena his son and successor entemena ca 2455 2425 bc restored the prestige of lagash illi of umma was subdued with the help of his ally lugal kinishe dudu of uruk successor to enshakushanna and also on the king list this lugal kinishe dudu seems to have been the predominant figure at the time since he also claimed to rule kish and ur a tripod of silver dedicated by entemena to his god is now in the louvre a frieze of lions devouring ibexes and deer incised with great artistic skill runs round the neck while the eagle crest of lagash adorns the globular part the vase is a proof of the high degree of excellence to which the goldsmith s art had already attained a vase of calcite also dedicated by entemena has been found at nippur after entemena a series of weak corrupt priest kings is attested for lagash the last of these urukagina was known for his judicial social and economic reforms and his may well be the first legal code known to history empire of lugal anne mundu of adab following this period the region of mesopotamia seems to have come under the sway of a sumerian conqueror from adab lugal anne mundu ca 2400 2330 bc ruling in uruk ur and lagash according to inscriptions he ruled from the persian gulf to the mediterranean and up to the zagros mountains including elam however his empire fell apart with his death his power may have been limited however as his reign seems to have been contemporaneous with the third dynasty of kish inaugurated by ku bau or ku baba ca 2400 2360 bc unique in the fact that she was the only woman ever to reign as king before overthrowing the rule of en shukash anna of the 2nd uruk dynasty and becoming monarch the king list says she was a tavern keeper in later centuries she was worshipped as a minor goddess achieving important status in the hurrian and hittite periods when she was identified with the hurrian goddess hannahannah in the post hittite phrygian period she was called kubele latin cybele great mother of the gods empire of lugal zage si of umma urukagina was overthrown and his city lagash captured by lugal zage si the high priest of umma lugal zage si also took uruk and ur and made uruk his capital in a long inscription that he caused to be engraved on hundreds of stone vases dedicated to en lil of nippur he boasts that his kingdom extended from the lower sea persian gulf along the tigris and euphrates to the upper sea or mediterranean his empire was finally overthrown by sargon of akkad who founded the first semitic empire akkadian empire gutian period following the fall of sargon s empire to the gutians a brief dark ages ensued however one prominent sumerian ruler of this time was gudea of lagash sumerian renaissance 3rd dynasty of ur the gutians were finally driven out by the sumerians under utu hegal of uruk who was in turn defeated by ur nammu of ur who founded what is known as the 3rd dynasty of ur although the sumerian language emegir was again made official sumerian identity was already in decline as the population became continually more and more semiticised after this ur iii dynasty was destroyed by the elamites in 2004 bc a fierce rivalry developed between the city states of larsa more under elamite than sumerian influence and isin that was more amorite as the semitic speakers had come to be called the semites ended up prevailing in mesopotamia by the time of hammurabi of babylon who founded the babylonian empire and the language and name of sumer gradually passed into the realm of antiquarian scholars although their influence on babylonia and all subsequent cultures was indeed great a few historians assert that some sumerians managed to preserve their identity in a sense by forming the magi or hereditary priestly caste noted among the later medes archaeologically the fall of the ur iii dynasty corresponds to the beginning of the middle bronze age see also sumer sumerian king list babylonia and assyria

 id=350279 title iraq survey group nonfiltered 36 processed 36 dbindex 450035 the iraq survey group isg was a fact finding mission sent by the multinational force in iraq after the 2003 invasion of iraq to find weapons of mass destruction wmd programs developed by iraq under the regime of former iraqi president saddam hussein its final report is commonly called the duelfer report it consisted of a 1 400 member international team organized by the pentagon and cia to hunt for suspected stockpiles of wmd such as chemical and biological agents and any supporting research programs and infrastructure that could be used to develop wmd formation the isg was made up of more than one thousand americans britons and australians with the united states providing the bulk of the personnel and resources for the operation these people included civilian and military intelligence and wmd experts as well as a large number people working to provide armed security and support david kay a prominent u s scientist who searched for wmd after the first gulf war was chosen to head the group the agency tasked as the head u s government agency of the isg was a joint venture of the cia and the dia defense intelligence agency the dod counterpart to the cia which is primarily responsible for inter agency cooperation the iraq survey group was the successor to the united nations inspections teams unmovic led by hans blix and from the iaea led by mohamed elbaradei which had been mandated by the u n security council to search for illegal weapons before the conflict see iraq disarmament crisis organization and operations to make the wmd search more manageable isg was operationally divided up into several sectors each with its own sector control point the three sectors were north baghdad and south with sector control point baghdad also known as scp b or skip bee being the primary and largest scp b and the core of the isg staff were located on camp slayer at the former al radwaniyah presidential site on baghdad international airport in western baghdad from its founding in the spring of 2003 until disbandment at the end of february 2005 scp b was commanded by a series of coalition officers from the u s army u s marines and australian army its first commander was u s army reserve colonel george waldroup who led the group from its founding until the summer of 2004 he was later picked by u s secretary of defense donald rumsfeld to head the strategic support branch of the defense intelligence agency following col waldroup usmc col frank johnson was pulled from retirement and took the reigns until october 2004 col johnson was followed by lt col carr an australian engineer who was briefly followed by maj peck now ltc the final commander of scp b was australian military police major damien hick scp b s missions included not only the search for wmd but work on counter terrorism and the ongoing investigation into the fate of u s navy captain michael scott speicher who was shot down during the gulf war of 1991 initially presumed dead he was later declared missing when evidence emerged after the war that he had survived the crash of his aircraft scp b was organized into several mobile collection teams or mcts made up of members of american british and australian forces with americans providing the vast majority an mct generally consisted of a commander usually a major or captain although mcts were led by lieutenants and full colonels at times and anywhere from ten to twenty other personnel depending on mission requirements the majority of scp b personnel were mobilized american national guard or army reserve soldiers although the united states navy marines and air force as well several coalition forces were also well represented as well as some us army special forces personel the other key piece of scp b were the u s army military police crews assigned to the organization the military police provided convoy and site security for the mcts as well as secure transport for isg personnel in their travels around baghdad scp b also contained other special units such as dog handlers who were mostly civilian contractors explosives ordnance disposal ground penetrating radar teams and a wmd transportation and storage group by any measure other than the obvious actually finding wmd stockpiles scp b was remarkably successful acting as an independent entity outside of the normal chain of command isg reported directly to rumsfeld it surveyed and exploited hundreds of possible wmd sites across the breadth of iraq with very few problems except for two unfortunate incidents scp b s casualty record was exceptional considering the amount of time its personnel spent on the roads and out among the populace the first incident was the paint factory explosion of april 26th 2004 which killed two soldiers us army sergeants lawrence roukey and sherwood baker and injured several more these were scp b s first casualties in over a year of operations the second was a vehicle borne ied attack against charles duelfer s convoy which claimed the lives of two of duelfer s psd ssg clinton wisdom and spc don clary both of the kansas army national guard s 130th field artillery regiment throughout the life of isg and scp b there were only two occasions where chemical weapons were found the first was a sarin mortar shell which had been reworked into a roadside improvised explosive device by insurgents the second was a handful of 122 millimeter rocket warheads filled with inert mustard gas that was recovered near babylon both were thought to be remainders from the iran iraq war and were useless as offensive weapons both were later destroyed by isg personnel in late 2004 the isg and the mcts undertook some counter insurgency operations although many details remain classified there were other missions and organizations operating within the isg which are top secret and are unlikely to be declassified anytime soon interim progress report after six months searching for wmd the isg issued an interim progress report on october 3 2003 the team has found evidence of wmd related program activities but no actual chemical biological or nuclear weapons in addition to details of dormant wmd programs the october 2003 report also includes discoveries of non wmd programs banned by the u n and concealed during the iaea and unmovic inspections that began in 2002 the discoveries made by the isg include a clandestine network of laboratories that contained equipment suitable for continuing chemical biological weapons research and vials of live c botulinum okra b from which a biological agent can be produced lines of enquiry adopted by the isg include the examination of sites across iraq as well as interviewing scientists truck drivers and other workers with possible knowledge of wmd the failure to find any stockpiles of chemical biological or nuclear weapons has proved a problem for washington and london who used intelligence indicating that iraq did possess wmd stockpiles as one of the primary justifications for the invasion of iraq the british government in particular placed very heavy emphasis on this intelligence david kay resigns on january 23 2004 the head of the isg david kay resigned his position stating that he believed wmd stockpiles would not be found in iraq i don t think they existed commented kay what everyone was talking about is stockpiles produced after the end of the last gulf war and i don t think there was a large scale production program in the nineties in a briefing to the senate armed services committee kay criticized the pre war wmd intelligence and the agencies that produced it saying it turns out that we were all wrong probably in my judgment and that is most disturbing kay told the sasc during his oral report the following though based on the intelligence that existed i think it was reasonable to reach the conclusion that iraq posed an imminent threat now that you know reality on the ground as opposed to what you estimated before you may reach a different conclusion although i must say i actually think what we learned during the inspection made iraq a more dangerous place potentially than in fact we thought it was even before the war kay s team has established that the iraqi regime had the production capacity and know how to produce a great deal more chemical and biological weaponry when international economic sanctions were lifted a policy change which was actively being sought by many united nations member states kay also believed some components of the former iraqi regime s wmd program had been moved to syria shortly before the 2003 invasion though the duelfer report addenda see below later reported there was no evidence of this on february 6 2004 bush convened the iraq intelligence commission an independent inquiry into the intelligence used to justify the iraq war and the failure to find wmd this was shortly followed by the conclusion of a similar inquiry in the united kingdom the butler review which was boycotted by the two main opposition parties due to disagreements on its scope and independence in 2003 the u s sponsored search for wmd had been budgeted for 400 million with an additional 600 million added in 2004 kay s successor named by cia director george tenet was the former u n weapons inspector charles duelfer who stated at the time that the chances of finding any wmd stockpiles in iraq were close to nil duelfer report on september 30 2004 the isg released the duelfer report its final report on iraq s wmd programs the key findings are as follows saddam totally dominated the regime s strategic decision making saddam s primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have un sanctions lifted while maintaining the security of the regime the introduction of the oil for food program off in late 1996 was a key turning point for the regime by 2000 2001 saddam had managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their international support iran was the pre eminent motivator of desire to rebuild iraq s wmd capability the iraq survey group isg judged that events in the 1980s and early 1990s shaped saddam s belief in the value of wmd the former regime had no formal written strategy or plan for the revival of wmd after sanctions operations tempo 2004 2005 although the search for wmd had been conducted earnestly and fruitlessly during the initial year of the occupation site exploitation continued through the summer of 2004 in late summer and early fall the wmd search tempo slowed considerably all of the most promising sites had been exploited in 2003 2004 and even most of the unpromising sites had been exploited by fall of 2004 in late september and into october of 2004 the number of site exploitations increased significantly although most of these were revisits to already exploited sites some of which had been altered by iraqis in the intervening months for instance the former iraqi chemical brigade headquarters building in baghdad was in the midst of being converted to office space when isg personnel returned for a second visit isg s exploitation operations mostly ceased in early november of 2004 most mcts were disbanded and the personnel returned to their parent units and the mp teams that supported them were dispersed to other camps and given other missions in january 2005 the group announced the conclusion of its search the isg stated that while it had not found evidence that saddam possessed wmd stocks in 2003 they acknowledged the possibility that some weapons existed in iraq although not of a militarily significant capability march 2005 report addenda in march 2005 duelfer added an addenda to the original report covering five topics prewar movement of wmd material out of iraq stating isg judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of wmd material from iraq to syria took place but also acknowledging that isg was unable to complete its investigation and is unable to rule out the possibility that wmd was evacuated to syria before the war iraqi detainees concluding the wmd investigation has gone as far as feasible there is no further purpose in holding many of these detainees residual proliferation risks people concluding former wmd program participants are most likely to seek employment in the benign civil sector either in iraq or elsewhere however because a single individual can advance certain wmd activities it remains an important concern residual pre 1991 cbw stocks in iraq concluding any remaining chemical munitions in iraq do not pose a militarily significant threat isg has not found evidence to indicate that iraq did not destroy its bw weapons or bulk agents residual proliferation risk equipment and materials concluding iraq s remaining chemical and biological physical infrastructure does not pose a proliferation concern in media interviews before the addenda were published officials went further on the important question of the possible smuggling of wmd to syria saying they had not seen any information indicating that wmd or significant

flavoured distilled alcoholic drink produced in the eastern mediterranean lebanon syria jordan palestine israel and iraq the word comes from arabic araq meaning sweat or juice arak is not to be confused with the similarly named liquor arrack consumption arak is usually not drunk straight but is mixed in approximately 1 3 arak to 2 3 water and ice is then added this dilution causes the liquor to turn an opaque milky white colour arak is also commonly mixed with teas and juices drinkers may also take arak with a chaser on the side arak is usually served with mezza which could include dozens of small dishes which many arak drinkers prefer as accompaniment rather than main courses when the main course of the meal is served it may hardly be touched in favour of these smaller dishes it is also well appreciated with barbecues along with garlic sauce tradition requires that water is added before ice because if ice is added directly it results in the formation of an aesthetically unpleasing skin on the surface of the drink for the same reason an arak glass should never be refilled directly after being emptied a clean glass must be used each time in restaurants when a bottle of arak is ordered the waiter will usually bring a number of glasses along with it for this reason preparation it all begins with the vineyards and the grapevine quality the vine should be well mature usually of a golden colour the vineyards are not sprinkled they are left to the care of the mediterranean climate natural rain and sun the grapes are cultivated in late september and october the grapes are squeezed and put in barrels together with the juice in arabic el mestarr and left to ferment for three weeks occasionally the whole mix is stirred to release the co2 now the first distillation the goal is to get the alcohol out of the mixture that has fermented for three weeks the distillation is done using the alembic or el karkeh also al karkeh made of copper it s basically three parts the lower being a container used to boil what s inside on fire the middle part collects the vapors coming out of the boiling ingredients the third part is used to cool the vapor that will be transformed to liquid and collected on its way out usually in a container of glass so the mixture of all the fermented and squeezed grapes is put into the lower part and it is boiled at a temperature around 80 c boiling temperature of alcohol but below 100 c boiling temperature of water the idea is to collect the alcohol in the container without any water now the second distillation here is made the actual final product the alcohol collected in first distillation is to be distilled again but this time mixed with aniseed the whole alembic is washed to remove all the remains of the precedent distillation the alcohol and the aniseed are mixed together in the lower part of the karkeh called in arabic ddessett the ratio of alcohol to aniseed may vary it s one of the major factors of the quality of the final product another distillation takes place usually on the lowest possible temperature the procedure is very slow traditionally a drinking party takes place at the same time people would gather to help the producer and have a drinking party this is one of the most prestigious and traditional parties of the lebanese mountains it usually takes place in november note once the first distillation is done it s not mandatory to have the second one immediately after variations one of the basic varieties considered by many to be the prototypical arak is distilled from grapes and anise numerous varieties of arak are popular in all the countries edging the mediterranean and in parts of the far east in the levant it is distilled from fermented grape juice or at times sugar and is considered by the inhabitants to be greatly superior to similar hard liquors in other countries the same spirit is called ouzo in greece mastika in republic of macedonia and bulgaria and rak another form of the word arak in turkey they are made from a variety of products like grain molasses plums figs and potatoes other similar drinks are the arak of iraq made from fermented date juice and the zibib of egypt a peasant made drink an iranian variant called aragh e sagi persian literally dog s sweat is produced without anise and has a higher alcohol content than other varieties further west along the northern shores of the mediterranean the italian anesone french pastis and spanish ojén served as aperitifs or refreshers are all sweeter versions of arak also in the far east a comparable drink known as arrack distilled from palm sap or rice is very popular in korea it is known as soju while arak is extremely popular in syria the most prized brands are lebanese amongst them ksara and most famous of all massaya many lebanese drinkers however themselves distil their own liquor the quality of home made arak arak baladi is considered far superior to commercial brands some restaurants occasionally serve home made arak at a very high price many lebanese towns are well known for their high quality home made arak among them zahle in the bekaa valley the best quality can be found in toula a village in the northern lebanese mountains toula is very well known across the north for its famous home made arak you can find it in any restaurant in zgharta or ehden two important towns around that area the abv differs from one version to another with the most alcoholic reaching 80 or even more the best quality arak is usually between 53 and 60 when mixed with water it is diluted to 20 30 history it is believed that arak was developed by the christian and jewish minorities of the islamic middle east jabir ibn hayyan a muslim alchemist of the early islamic era invented the alembic which facilitated the distillation of alcoholic spirits the name used in lebanon is al karkeh or little more formally al kattara however muslims did not use his invention to produce alcoholic beverages since in islam the consumption of alcohol is forbidden hence his discovery was employed to distill perfume from flowers and to produce kohl a women s eye cosmetic in which a black powder is liquefied then converted to vapour and allowed to re solidify the arabs carried the art of distilling kohl to spain from where it spread to the remainder of europe in these christian lands it took on a much different use the production of alcoholic drinks with the utilisation of this method of producing hard spirits the arabic name al kohl which became alcohol was adopted due to the similar method the arabs used in manufacturing this cosmetic the words in english relating to the art of distillation besides alcohol such as alchemy alchemist and alembic attest to the arab origin of producing the many intoxicants found in western lands traditionally arak was generally of local or village manufacture but in the last few decades it has increasingly been produced in large manufacturing plants it has remained the preference of those who enjoy alcoholic drinks in the middle east in competition with the many drinks imported from the west see also arrack a different drink

 id=56125 title sioux nonfiltered 64 processed 64 dbindex 450064 the sioux ipa are a native american people the term can describe any ethnic group within the great sioux nation or any of the nation s many dialects the sioux are often divided into three main groups based on dialect and subculture teton translation uncertain the westernmost sioux known for their hunting and warrior culture often referred to as the lakota isanti knife originating from the name of a lake in present day minnesota the extreme east of the dakotas minnesota and northern iowa often referred to as the santee or dakota ihanktowan ihanktowana village at the end and little village at the end respectively often referred to as the yankton yanktonai or nakota oceti sakowin today it is popular to refer to the teton isanti or ihanktowan ihanktowana as either lakota otherwise known as the sioux dakota or nakota respectively in any of the three main dialects lakota dakota and nakota all translate to mean friend or more properly ally usage of either lakota dakota or nakota may then refer to the alliance that once bound the great sioux nation together the historical sioux referred to the great sioux nation as the oceti sakowin meaning seven council fires each fire represented an oyate ethnic groups or nation of people the seven nations that comprise the sioux are mdewakanton wahpetowan wahpeton wahpekute sissetowan sisseton the ihantowan yankton ihanktowana yanktonai and the teton lakota the first four comprise the main branches of the isanti santee or dakota the name sioux is an abbreviated form of nadouessioux borrowed into french canadian from nadoüessioüak from the early ottawa exonym na towe ssiwak sioux the proto algonquian form n tow wa meaning northern iroquoian has reflexes in several daughter languages that refer to a small rattlesnake massasauga sistrurus this information was interpreted by some that the ottawa borrowing was an insult however this proto algonquian term most likely is ultimately derived from a form tow meaning simply speak foreign language which was later extended in meaning in some algonquian languages to refer to the massasauga thus contrary to many accounts the ottawa word na towe ssiwak never equated the sioux with snakes today many of the ethnic groups continue to officially call themselves sioux which the federal government of the united states applied to all yankton yanktonai santee lakota people in the 19th and 20th centuries however some of the tribes have formally or informally adopted traditional names the rosebud sioux tribe is also known as the sicangu oyate brule nation and the oglala often use the name oglala lakota oyate rather than the english oglala sioux tribe or ost the alternative english spelling of ogallala is not considered proper the earlier linguistic 3 way division of the dakotan branch of the siouan family identified lakota dakota and nakota as dialects of a single language where lakota teton dakota santee and yankton nakota yanktonai assiniboine this classification was based in large part on each group s particular pronunciation of the autonym dakhóta lakhóta nakhóta however more recent research has shown that assiniboine and also stoney are not mutually intelligible with the sioux groups while the yankton yanktonai santee and teton groups all spoke mutually intelligible varieties of a sioux idiom this more recent classification identifies assiniboine and stoney as two separate languages with sioux being the third language that has three similar dialects teton santee sisseton yankton yanktonai furthermore the yankton yanktonai never referred to themselves using the pronunciation nakhóta but rather pronounced it the same as the santee i e dakhóta assiniboine and stoney speakers use the pronunciation nakhóta or nakhóda the term dakota has also been applied by anthropologists and governmental departments to refer to all sioux groups resulting in names such as teton dakota santee dakota etc this was due in large part to the misrepresented translation of the ottawa word from which sioux is derived supposedly meaning snake see above modern geographic divisions the sioux maintain many separate tribal governments scattered across several reservations and communities in the dakotas minnesota nebraska and even canada southern saskatchewan and manitoba the yankton yanktonai the smallest division reside on the yankton reservation in south dakota and the northern portion of standing rock reservation while the santee live mostly in minnesota and nebraska but include bands in the sisseton wahpeton flandreau and crow creek reservations in south dakota the lakota are the westernmost of the three groups occupying lands in both north and south dakota yankton yanktonai nakota the yankton yanktonai are a branch of sioux peoples who moved into northern minnesota they originally constituted of two main ethnic groups the yankton campers at the end and yanktonai lesser campers at the end economically they were involved in quarrying pipestone it should be remembered that the divisions of the old political organization of the dakota nations collectively referred to as the seven council fires or o éti akówi is used to index the entire dakota collective the word koda in dakota and kola in lakota for example means friend or ally therefore dakota means an alliance of friends the root word is frequently come upon in the siouan language as in okodakiciye meaning society association republic the tribe consists of seven bands closely related springing from one parent stock and still joined in alliance for mutual protection doane robinson 1904 19 the three divisions are somewhat arbitrary and are based primarily on relatively minor dialectical differences there are many kinship ties throughout the three groups since these groups were historically and are probably today as well much more fluid than discrete furthermore due to land expropriation and massive social upheavals caused by the dakota u s wars circa 1862 1890 some members of all three groups fled to rupert s land later the northwest territories of canada est 1870 their descendants reside on eight small dakota reserves in canada four of which are located in manitoba sioux valley long plain tipi birdtail creek and oak lake and the remaining four standing buffalo moose woods cap round plain and

becoming the titonwan tribe subsisting on the buffalo herds and corn trade with their linguistic cousins the mandan and hidatsa along the missouri the clash of sioux and white cultures the appearance of the sioux from the eyes of a white explorer of the nineteenth century according to the journal kept by jedediah strong smith the fur trapper hunter and explorer who effectively opened up the west for later white settlement and gold prospecting as reported by author maurice sullivan when he first saw the proud sioux who as diah observed were rovers their intelligence superior morals stature and manner of living such that here in the sioux nation aboriginal life was most attractive pp 16 17 the distant appearance of these lodges when many indians are encamped together cannot fail of pleasing clustered together with their yellow sides and painted tops the children playing around in the intervals between them the men going out or coming in from hunting the horses feeding on the neighboring prairie the dogs sleeping or playing in the sun or shade the squaws at their several labors and the boys at their several sports these taken in conjunction with a beautiful mingling of prairie and woodland or some undulation of the land or some bend of the great river that brings them all at once to view and above all eyes that are not accustomed to such a sight would almost persuade a man to renounce the world take the lodge and live the careless lazy life of an indian p 16 the lodges of the sioux he recorded were gaudily decorated with paintings of the buffalo hunt battles and other events of historical importance to the occupants outside a warrior s lodge on a tripod made of decorated poles was hung the medicine sack of the owner and over the sack a piece of scarlet blanket or the skin of a white wolf within the squaw was busy with her household labors while the master of the lodge was seated leaning back with no borrowed dignity against a mat made of peeled willows supported by a tripod of sticks in the moral scale as their appearance would indicate they rank above the mass of indians p 17 see bibliography below such was the approving opinion of at least one white mountain man of the time and indeed many of these mountain men attempted to live in some fashion among the indians forced relocation of the sioux by the united states government later in the 19th century as the railroads hired hunters to exterminate the buffalo herds the indians primary food supply in order to force all tribes into sedentary habitations the santee and lakota were forced to accept white defined reservations in exchange for the rest of their lands and domestic cattle and corn in exchange for buffalo becoming dependent upon annual federal payments guaranteed by treaty in minnesota the treaties of traverse des sioux and mendota in 1851 left the sioux with a reservation twenty miles wide on each side of the minnesota river the 1862 sioux uprising in 1862 after a failed crop the year before and a winter starvation the federal payment was late to arrive the local traders would not issue any more credit to the santee and the local federal agent told the santee that they were free to eat grass or their own dung as a result on august 17 1862 the sioux uprising began when a few santee men murdered a white farmer and most of his family igniting further attacks on white settlements along the minnesota river the santee then attacked the trading post and the federal agent was later found dead with his mouth stuffed full of grass no one knows the exact number but between 500 to 1000 civilian men women and children mostly german immigrants were massacred until state and federal forces put down the revolt courts martial tried and condemned 303 santee for war crimes numerous first hand accounts describe rapes and murders of the whites by the santee relatively recently published are the first hand accounts of two german american women who describe the murders they observed of family and friends on november 5 1862 in minnesota in courts martial 303 santee sioux were found guilty of rape and murder of hundreds of white farmers and were sentenced to hang president abraham lincoln remanded the death sentence of 284 of the warriors signing off on the execution of 38 santee men by hanging on december 26 1862 in mankato minnesota the largest mass execution in us history during and after the revolt many santee and their kin fled minnesota and eastern dakota joining their relatives in the west or settling in the james river valley in a short lived reservation before being forced to move to crow creek reservation on the east bank of the missouri others were able to remain in minnesota and the east in small reservations existing into the 21st century including sisseton wahpeton flandreau and devils lake spirit lake or fort totten reservations in the dakotas some ended up eventually in nebraska where the santee sioux tribe today has a

his cousin princess charlotte of holstein plön 1744 70 until his father s death he was styled hereditary prince of augustenborg he was a prince with an exceptionally high dose of danish blood in his ancestry his maternal grandmother paternal grandmother and paternal great grandmother having been respectively born countess of reventlow countess of danneskiold samsoe and countess of ahlefeldt langeland he was closely related to all important families of the then high nobility of denmark the negaive side was that his ancestry was quite much comital instead of including royal princesses and duchesses of petty german states as was customary with the oldenburg royal family their family was regarded as a bit lower than the ebenbuertige small rulers of germany thought to be the standard in 1786 the 20 year old hereditary prince however married his distant cousin the 14 year old louise auguste of denmark and norway 1771 1843 daughter of the late queen caroline mathilde of denmark louise

court physician and de facto regent of the country at the time of her birth she was referred to sometimes as la petite struensee the story of antecedents of the prince s marriage goes as follows in february 1779 the nation s foremost statesman chief minister count andreas peter bernstorff hatched an ingenious plan for the young princess something that has been often customary with royal children suspected of not being sired by their nominal fathers but by mother s illicit liaison to marry such to another member of the royal house since a male child of hers could inherit the throne some day it would be advantageous to arrange a marriage early and to marry the half royal back into the extended royal house to the hereditary prince of augustenborg this plan not only had the positive effect of more closely connecting the danish royal house s two lines the ruling house of oldenborg and the offshoot house of augustenborg thus discouraging the threat of a breakup of the kingdom but also the prevention of her marriage into the swedish royal house the latter danger was rather low however at that time there were swedish princes only twenty years or more her senior and her first cousin the future gustav iv adolf of sweden had just been born when she already was seven the binding agreements were made in 1780 and in spring 1785 the young duke frederik christian ii came to copenhagen the

of the best singer it is the québécois adaptation of the french television show star academy produced by netherlands company endemol based in the spanish format called operación triunfo description it is aired for two months each year february to april on the tva network it is part of the reality television craze of the turn of the millennium hosted by julie snyder the show is a competition to find the best young francophone singer not only in quebec but also in french speaking regions of canada having auditions in ontario eastern ontario and new brunswick l acadie then fourteen people seven of each gender are chosen to compete in front of the cameras it is separated in two simultaneous formats each day during the week a show presents moments of the life and training in the common house of the académiciens and each weekend sees one gala show where the contenders sing at each of these galas some participants are put on the line and one is chosen to stay by the public and by the judging panel it proved to be immensely popular drawing not only viewership but genuine affection from the public for the young idealistic contenders pride also arises for the regions where the participants are from like pride was felt by many from the acadian people when wilfred le bouthillier from acadia was chosen for the competition and later crowned winner of the first 2003 edition it has also proved to be an effective springboard for the singing careers of some of its past participants like 2003 finalists wilfred le bouthillier who recorded with the help of renowned cajun singer zachary richard and marie élaine thibert who also released an album and sung for the soundtrack of léa pool s movie the blue butterfly origins it is inspired by the french show star academy and is similar to the pop idol american idol phenomena the name was francized for its quebec adaptation because of the local importance given to the respect of the french language however it does create an grammatically impossible phrase in french the proper translation would be académie des stars although this could be considered less catchy francization is typically given even more importance in quebec french than in france itself see office québécois de la langue française a relatively small but notable difference in the show format from its french counterpart is the selection process each week the french version asks the public and judging panel to vote for which one out of the contenders in danger should be excluded from the show the results are announced live on stage to the excluded member and the viewers while this formula was followed in the beginning for star académie it soon was changed because of protests for the system was seen as cruel treatment to the excluded participant on one early show singer daniel boucher quit the studio halfway through the show because of this impression consequently the public and judges are now asked to vote for the participant to remain at the académie the results are still announced live criticism star académie drew criticism for the capitalist and vertical integration strategies of producing megacompany quebecor to publicize the show and make it profitable for example each vote from the public costs one dollar the website is in large part reserved to paying members and the quebecor company massive owner of many quebec media heavily promoted the show via tva its own television network all of its magazines and newspapers like 7 jours and journal de montréal astral media s rockdétente also did a lot of heavy promoting themselves during the 2005 edition as the official stations of star académie also were criticized the instant celebrity machine and supposed lack of artistic integrity aspects of the whole enterprise

 id=234714 title medical imaging nonfiltered 96 processed 96 dbindex 450096 see also radiology radiography medical imaging refers to the techniques and processes used to create images of the human body or parts thereof for clinical purposes medical procedures seeking to reveal diagnose or examine disease or medical science including the study of normal anatomy and function as a discipline and in its widest sense it is part of biological imaging and incorporates radiology in the wider sense radiological sciences endoscopy medical thermography medical photography and microscopy e g for human pathological investigations measurement and recording techniques which are not primarily designed to produce images such as electroencephalography eeg and magnetoencephalography meg and others but which produce data susceptible to be represented as maps i e containing positional information can be seen as forms of medical imaging in the clinical context medical imaging is generally equated to radiology or clinical imaging and the medical practicer s responsible for interpreting and sometimes acquiring the images is a radiologist diagnostic radiography see radiography designates the technical aspects of medical imaging and in particular the acquisition of medical images the radiographer or radiologic technologist is usually responsible for acquiring medical images of diagnostic quality although some radiological interventions are performed by radiologists as a field of scientific investigation medical imaging constitutes a sub discipline of biomedical engineering medical physics or medicine depending on the context research and development in the area of instrumentation image acquisition e g radiography modelling and quantification are usually the preserve of biomedical engineering medical physics and computer science research into the application and interpretation of medical images is usually the preserve of radiology and the medical sub discipline relevant to medical condition or area of medical science neuroscience cardiology psychiatry psychology etc under investigation many of the techniques developed for medical imaging also have scientific and industrial applications medical imaging is often perceived to designate the set of techniques that produce images of the internal aspect of the body without having to open it in this restricted sense medical imaging can be seen as the solution of mathematical inverse problems this means that cause the properties of living tissue is inferred from effect the observed signal in the case of ultrasonography the probe consists of ultrasonic pressure waves and echoes inside the tissue show the internal structure in the case of projection radiography the probe is x ray radiation which is absorbed at different rates in different tissue types such as bone muscle and fat modern imaging technology fluoroscopy fluoroscopy produces real time images of internal structures of the body in a similar fashion to radiography but employs a constant input of x rays contrast media such as barium iodine and air are used to visualize internal organs as they work fluoroscopy is also used in image guided procedures when constant feedback during a procedure is required magnetic resonance imaging mri a magnetic resonance imaging instrument mri scanner uses powerful magnets to polarise and excite hydrogen nuclei single proton in water molecules in human tissue producing a detectable signal which is spatially encoded resulting in images of the body in brief mri involves the use of three kinds of electromagnetic field a very strong of the order of units of teslas static magnetic field to polarize the hydrogen nuclei called the static field a weaker time varying of the order of 1 khz for spatial encoding called the gradient field s and a weak radio frequency rf field for manipulation of the hydrogen nuclei to produce measurable signals collected through an rf antenna like ct mri traditionally creates a 2d image of a thin slice of the body and is therefore considered a tomographic imaging technique modern mri instruments are capable of producing images in the form of 3d blocks which may be considered a generalisation of the single slice tomographic concept unlike ct mri does not involve the use of ionizing radiation and is therefore not associated with the same health hazards for example there are no known long term effects of exposure to strong static fields this is the subject of some debate see safety in mri and therefore there is no limit on the number of scans to which an individual can be subjected in contrast with x ray and ct however there are well identified health risks associated with tissue heating from exposure to the rf field and the presence of implanted devices in the body such as pace makers these risks are strictly controlled as part of the design of the instrument and the scanning protocols used ct and mri being sensitive to different properties of the tissue the appearance of the images obtained with the two techniques differ markedly in ct x rays must be blocked by some form of dense tissue to create an image therefore the image quality when looking at soft tissues will be poor an mri can only see hydrogen based objects so bone which is calcium based will be a void in the image and will not affect soft tissue views this makes it excellent for peering into the brain and joints mri or nmr imaging as it was originally known has only been in use since the early 1980 s effects from long term or repeated exposure to the intense static magnetic field are not known nuclear medicine images from gamma cameras are used in nuclear medicine to detect regions of biological activity that are often associated with diseases a short lived isotope such as 131i is administered to the patient these isotopes are more readily absorbed by biologically active regions of the body such as tumors or fracture points in bones positron emission tomography pet positron emission tomography is used to detect certain brain diseases similarly to nuclear medicine a short lived isotope such as 18f is incorporated into a substance used by the body such as glucose which is absorbed by the tumor of interest pet scans are often viewed along side computed tomography scans which can be performed on the same equipment without moving the patient this allows the tumors detected by the pet scan to be viewed next to the rest of the patient s anatomy detected by the ct scan projection radiography radiographs more commonly known as x rays are often used to determine the type and extent of a fracture as well as for detecting pathological changes in the lungs with the use of radio opaque contrast media such as barium they can also be used to visualize the structure of the stomach and intestines this can help diagnose ulcers or certain types of colon cancer tomography tomography is the method of imaging a single plane or slice of an object resulting in a tomogram there are several forms of tomography linear tomography this is the most basic form of tomography the x ray tube moved from point a to point b above the patient while the cassette holder or bucky moves simultaneously under the patient from point b to point a the fulcrum or pivot point is set to the area of interest in this manner the points above and below the focal plane are blurred out just as the background is blurred when panning a camera during exposure no longer carried out and replaced by computed tomography poly tomography this was a complex form of tomography with this technique a number of geometrical movements were programmed such as hypocycloidic circular figure 8 and elliptical philips medical systems produced one such device called the polytome no longer carried out replaced by computed tomography zonography this is a variant of linear tomography where a limited arc of movement is used it is still used in some centres for visualising the kidney during an intravenous urogram ivu orthopantomography opt the only common tomographic examination in use this makes use of a complex movement to allow the radiographic examination of the mandible as if it were a flat bone it is often referred to as a panaray but this is incorrect as it is a trademark of a specific company s equipment computed tomography cat or ct main article computed tomography a ct scan also known as a cat scan computed axial tomography scan is a helical tomography latest generation which traditionally produces a 2d image of the structures in a thin section of the body it uses x rays it has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography repeated scans should be limited ultrasound medical ultrasonography uses high frequency sound waves of between 2 0 to 10 0 megahertz that are reflected by tissue to varying degrees to produce a 2d image traditionally on a tv monitor this is often used to visualize the fetus in pregnant women other important uses include imaging the abdominal organs heart male genitalia and the veins of the leg while it may provide less anatomical information than techniques such as ct or mri it has several advantages which make it ideal as a first line test in numerous situations in particular that it studies the function of moving structures in real time it is also very safe to use as the patient is not exposed to radiation and the ultrasound does not appear to cause any adverse effects although information on this is not well documented it is also relatively cheap and quick to perform ultrasound scanners can be taken to critically ill patients in intensive care units avoiding the danger caused while moving the patient to the radiology department the real time moving image obtained can be used to guide drainage and biopsy procedures doppler capabilities on modern scanners allow the blood flow in arteries and veins to be assessed clinical imaging or biological imaging techniques electron microscopy the electron microscope is a microscope that can magnify very small details with high resolving power due to the use of electrons as the source of illumination magnifying at levels up to 2 000 000 times electron microscopy is employed in anatomic pathology to identify organelles within the cells its usefulness has been greatly reduced by immunhistochemistry but it is still irreplaceable for the diagnosis of kidney disease identification of immotile cilia syndrome and many other tasks creation of three dimensional images recently techniques have been developed to enable ct mri and ultrasound scanning software to produce 3d images for the physician traditionally ct and mri scans produced 2d static output on film to produce 3d images many scans are made then combined by computers to produce a 3d model which can then be manipulated by the physician 3d ultrasounds are produced using a somewhat similar technique with the ability to visualize important structures in great detail 3d visualization methods are a valuable resource for the diagnosis and surgical treatment of many pathologies it was a key resource and also the cause of failure for the famous but ultimately unsuccessful attempt by singaporean surgeons to separate iranian twins ladan and laleh bijani in 2003 the 3d equipment was used previously for similar operations with great success other proposed or developed techniques include diffuse optical tomography elastography electrical impedance tomography optoacoustic imaging ophthalmology a scan b scan corneal topography heidelberg retinal tomography optical coherence tomography scanning laser ophthalmoscopy some of these techniques are still at a research stage and not yet used in clinical routines non diagnostic imaging neuroimaging has also been used in experimental circumstances to allow people especially disabled persons to control outside devices acting as a brain computer interface medical imaging service this is a specialized area of medical equipment service and repair which is separate from the biomedical field although a hospital with their own service group may include them in the biomed department at one time there were only two ways to receive training for this field one was to learn it in the military and the other was on the job training ojt from the manufacturer but since the 1980 s several independent training centers have been started one such school is rsti there are different means of employment in this occupation working for the manufacturer s field service department oem working for a hospital in house and working for an independent outside or independent provider the most stable positions are with the oem or hospital as you can remain current through on going

 id=428085 title electrospray ionization nonfiltered 127 processed 127 dbindex 450127 electrospray ionization esi is a technique used in mass spectrometry to produce ions it is especially useful in producing ions from macromolecules because it overcomes the propensity of these molecules to fragment when ionized the invention of electrospray ionization was rewarded with the attribution of the nobel prize in chemistry to john fenn in 2002 how it works in electrospray ionization a liquid is pushed through a very small charged usually metal capillary this liquid contains the substance which is to be studied the analyte dissolved in a large amount of solvent which is usually much more volatile than the analyte volatile acids bases or buffers are often added to this solution as well the analyte exists as an ion in solution either in a protonated form or as an anion as like charges repel the liquid pushes itself out of the capillary and forms a mist or an aerosol of small droplets about 10m across this jet of aerosol droplets is at least partially produced by a process involving the formation of a taylor cone and a jet from the tip of this cone a neutral carrier gas such as nitrogen gas is sometimes used to help nebulize the liquid and to help evaporate the neutral solvent in the small droplets as the small droplets evaporate suspended in the air the charged analyte molecules are forced closer together the drops become unstable as the similarly charged molecules come closer together and the droplets once again break up this is referred to as coulombic fission because it is the repulsive coulombic forces between charged analyte molecules that drive it this process repeats itself until the analyte is free of solvent and is a lone ion there remains debate as to the exact mechanisms of electrospray processes particularly in the later part of the process as the lone ion is formed the lone ion then continues along to the mass analyzer of a mass spectrometer in electrospray processes the ions observed are quasimolecular ions that are ionized by the addition of a proton hydrogen ion to give m analyte molecule h hydrogen ion or other cation such as sodium ion or the removal of a proton for example in electrospray multiply charged ions such as are often observed for large macromolecules there will often be a distribution of many charge states and the charge on the ions can be great such as note that these are all even electron species electrons themselves alone have neither been added or removed as with some other ionizations the formation of ions in electrospray is somewhat homologous to acid base reactions redox reactions do occur and a circuit with measurable current flow exists but atomic and molecular ions are the primary carriers of charge in the solution and gas phases issues of debate there are two major competing theories about the final production of lone ions the charged residue model crm and the ion evaporation model iem electrospray droplets start off highly charged and as they shrink through evaporation the coulomb repulsion forces approach the force of surface tension that holds droplet together the droplet then becomes unstable and disintegrates into several droplets of smaller radius the charged residue model suggests that electrospray droplets undergo evaporation and disintegration cycles with each initial droplet leading to a multitude of much smaller daughter droplets each final daughter droplet contains on average one or less molecule of analyte when the last solvent molecules evaporate from such droplet the analyte molecule is left with the charges that the droplet carried the ion evaporation desorption model suggests that as droplet reaches certain radius the field strength at the surface of the droplet becomes great enough to push or desorb ions directly out of the droplet characteristically the fission event corresponds to an almost negligible loss in droplet mass but a significant drop in charge it has been suggested that both models probably occur for different analytes solvents and in the limit of both models they have a tendency to converge that is to say that the distinction between a droplet containing an analyte molecule and an analyte molecule surrounded by a layer of solvent eventually disappears and coulombic fission looks a lot like ion evaporation the real question is scale and timing and the techniques to definitively determine this are not available the use of the word ionization in electrospray ionization is criticized by some because many of the ions observed are thought to be preformed in solution before the electrospray process or created by simple changes in concentrations as the aerosolized droplets shrink it is argued that electrospray is simply an interface for transferring ions from the solution phase to the gas phase variants there exist many variations on the basic electrospray technique two important ones are microspray µ spray and nanospray the primary difference is in the reduced flow rate of the analyte containing liquid however many other differences such as the reduced internal diameter of the tubing or lack of nebulization gas exist because of the difference in flow rate these variants are important because they generally offer better sensitivity over traditional electrospray the µ and nano designations refer to the flow rate of the analyte containing liquid µliters minute and nanoliters minute respectively applications liquid chromatography mass spectrometry see also the main article on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry electrospray ionization is the primary ion source used in liquid chromatography mass spectrometry because it s a liquid gas interface that is capable of coupling liquid chomatography with mass spectrometry noncovalent gas phase interactions electrospray ionization is also ideal in studying noncovalent gas phase interactions the electrospray process is capable of transferring liquid phase noncovalent complexes into the gas phase without disrupting the noncovalent interaction this means that a cluster of two molecules can be studied in the gas phase by other mass spectrometry techniques an interesting example of this is studying the interactions between enzymes and drugs which are inhibitors of the enzyme because inhibitors generally work by noncovalently binding to its target enzyme with reasonable affinity the noncovalent complex can be studied in this way competition studies have been done in this way to screen for potential new drug candidates colloid thrusters electrospray techniques are employed in the control of satellites by allowing precise and effective thrusts here the method s property of fine controllable particle ejection is put to use deposition of particles for nanostructures in nanotechnology the electrospray method may be employed to deposit single particles on surfaces this is accomplished by spraying colloids and making sure that on average there is not more than one particle per droplet consequent drying of the surrounding solvent results in an aerosol stream of single particles of the desired type here the ionizing property of the process is not crucial for the application but may be put to use in electrostatic precipitation of the particles external links a thesis with significant background on electrospray

the rock era it is certified 6x platinum by the riaa making it the best selling album by a solo beatle history the outpouring of such consistently great material on all things must pass took many critics by surprise with harrison having long been overshadowed by the talents of john lennon and paul mccartney despite the fact that some of his later period beatles inclusions while my guitar gently weeps something and here comes the sun were hailed as highlights of their respective albums consequently as harrison had only placed just a few songs on any given beatles album he had amassed many compositions by their break up enabling him to offload many of them in one go on all things must pass recorded from may to august 1970 at abbey road studios and then further recording and mixing at trident studios from august to september 1970 harrison enlisted the aid of phil spector to co produce the album giving all things must pass a heavy and reverb oriented sound typical for a 1960s 1970s spector production but a sound harrison would subsequently regret with the passage of time the album features the talents of ringo starr peter frampton members of badfinger eric clapton billy

 id=1173689 title stress fracture nonfiltered 159 processed 159 dbindex 450159 this article is about stress fractures in bones for stress fractures in engineering see fracture and fatigue material a stress fracture is one type of incomplete fractures in bones it could be described as a very small sliver or crack in the bone this is why it is sometimes dubbed hairline fracture it typically occurs in weight bearing bones such as the tibia fibula bones of the lower leg and metatarsals bones of the foot it is a common sports injury symptoms stress fractures usually have a narrow list of symptoms it could present as a generalized area of pain tenderness and pain with weight bearing usually when running a stress fracture has severe pain in the beginning of the run moderate pain in the middle of the run and severe pain at the end and after the run workup as with most diseases a stress fracture is best diagnosed after interview and examination by an astute physician investigations are not necessary to diagnose a stress fracture x rays usually do not show any evidence of stress fractures so a ct scan mri or 3 phase bone scan may be more effective in unclear cases histological examination of the bone is the most accurate test but it obviously can only be performed on amputated limbs or during autopsy of patients who have died treatment if a stress fracture occurs in a weightbearing bone healing will be delayed or prevented by continuing to put weight on that limb rest is the only way to completely heal a stress fracture the average time of complete rest from the activity that caused the stress fracture is one week a fracture requires 4 to 8 weeks of recuperation however which may include no more than light use of the injured body part as long as activity does not cause pain after the recuperative period another 2 weeks of mild activity without any pain may be recommended before the bone may be safely considered healed and activity may gradually increase during this time it is advised that training errors be identified for instance too much too soon and avoided in the future one rule of thumb is to not increase the volume of training by more than 10 from one week to the next rehabilitation usually consists of muscle strength training to help dissipate the excessive forces transmitted to the bones in some cases an electronic stimulator or bone stimulator may be used these devices send electrical impulses into the bone to promote healing recent studies have shown that the bone heals naturally via electromagnetic stimulation electromagnetically stimulating the bone causes the bone to lay out more bone cells that strengthen the bone bracing or casting the limb with a hard plastic boot or air cast may also prove beneficial by taking some stress off the stress fracture an air cast has pre inflated cells that put light pressure on the bone which promotes healing by increasing blood flow to the area and takes away a lot of the pain because of the pressure it applies to the bone if the stress fracture is severe enough crutches also help to take all stress off the bone with severe stress fractures surgery may be needed for proper healing the procedure may involve pinning the fracture site and rehabilitation takes an average of six months causes bones are constantly attempting to remodel and repair themselves especially during a sport where extraordinary stress is applied to the bone over time if enough stress is placed on the bone that it exhausts the capacity of the bone to remodel a weakened site a stress fracture on the bone may appear the fracture does not appear suddenly it occurs from repeated traumas none of which is sufficient to cause a sudden break but which when added together overwhelm the osteoblasts that remodel the bone stress fractures commonly occur in sedentary people who suddenly undertake a burst of exercise whose bones are not used to the task they may also occur in olympic class athletes who do extraordinary quantities of high impact exercise or in soldiers who march long distances muscle fatigue can also play a role in the occurrence of stress fractures for every mile a runner runs more than 110 tons of force must be absorbed by the legs bones are not made to stand that much energy on their own and the muscles act as shock absorbers for the excess force but as muscles become tired and stop absorbing most of the shock the bones experience greater amounts of stress finally when muscles usually in the lower leg become so fatigued that they stop absorbing any shock all forces are transferred to the bones frequency dr johnathan c reeser states that in the us the annual incidence of stress fractures range from 5 to 30 depending on the sport and other risk factors stress fractures occur less frequently in african americans compared to caucasians due to a higher bmd bone mineral density women and highly active individuals are also at a higher risk the incidence probably also increases with age due to age related reductions in bmd but children may also be at risk because their bones have yet to reach full density and strength the female athlete triad also can put women at risk as disordered eating and osteoporosis can cause the bones to be severely weakened prevention one method of avoiding stress fractures is by adding more stress to the bones although counter intuitive given that stress fractures are caused by too much stress on the bones when moderate stress is applied to the bone in a controlled manner the bone becomes stronger and less susceptible to a stress fracture an easy way to do this is to follow one widely known rule for runners which states that mileage should be increased by no more than 10 per week this allows the bones to adapt to the added stress so they are able to withstand greater amounts of stress in the future strengthening exercises also help build more muscle strength in the legs strengthening these muscles will stop them from getting fatigued so quickly which allows them to absorb the pounding of running for longer periods of time key muscles that need to be strengthened with lower leg stress fractures are the calves and the shin muscles depending on a variety of factors including weight running surface and shoe durability runners should replace their shoes every 300 700 miles to allow adequate mid sole cushioning a change in the choice of running surfaces can also help prevent stress fractures when performing any exercise that applies more stress to the bones it may be wise to increase calcium and vitamin d intake depending on the individual also it is important to monitor foods eaten because nutrition plays a vital role in bone development certain individuals are at risk of osteoporosis and depending on the country in which medical care is being supplied there may be a screening program in place references reeser johnathan c md phd 2004 october 1 stress fracture

consisted of a store and an old railroad car left by the santa fe sometime after the opening of the strip residents wanted to come up with a new name for the growing town the name was changed to sterling but the postal service and santa fe would not accept it because there was a town by that name on their line in kansas the names of virgil and kermit were proposed but santa fe would not accept these names for the same reason therefore a committee consisting of mr george espy postmaster dr g w todd and congressman dennis flynn was appointed to select a name which the santa fe and postal service would accept the name of captain allyn k capron jr was proposed captain capron was a member of teddy roosevelt s rough riders and had been killed at the battle of san juan hill the name of capron was approved by a petition of the residents the santa fe and u s postal service accepted the name and so it stands today at one time capron was quite a thriving community it had two banks the bank of capron and the capron state bank three general stores two drug stores a hotel depot a millinery shop theater blacksmith a weekly newspaper the capron hustler a monthly newspaper the screech owl two barber shops hardware store lumber yard two churches warburton memorial methodist church and first congregational church the driftwood telephone company and hampton s foot powder factory in april 1939 a tornado struck capron making a straight line down the main business street many of the residents of town did not even know the tornado has struck until the next morning when they went downtown to open their stores and found them gone most tornados sound like trains and since a train goes through capron about every 20 minutes no one noticed most of the above businesses and the public school building which was only 10 years old were destroyed the majority of these businesses were never rebuilt however the public schools were rebuilt capron was always concerned with having a good school system in 1894 a small but enterprising group of driftwood township citizens provided for the establishment of the first capron public schools the school consisted of grades 1 8 and consisted of a two room frame building located south and east of the present south coop grain elevator this building proved adequate until 1909 when a new two story brick building was built in the north end of town at the site of the present school building the cost of the 1909 building was 8 500 00 in 1929 residents approved the building of a new one story building with a large gymnasium and auditorium attached the old two story building was torn down to make way for this modern facility this building was destroyed in the 1939 tornado and a new building auditorium and gymnasium were built in 1940 at the time this facility was considered to be one of the best schools in northwest oklahoma additions to the present building were made in 1952 vocational agriculture building 1956 additional classrooms and music room and 1964 when a new cafeteria was added to the school the high school was first accredited in 1912 in 1968 the high school was closed due to falling enrollment there were no families in the school district on public assistance in 1968 and the patrons of the district never voted down a tax increase for their school they wanted the very best for their children the

supreme court today capron has two large concrete grain elevators a rural water district office united methodist church garage filling station and american legion post the post office closed in 1994

 id=2823760 title tonicity nonfiltered 173 processed 173 dbindex 450173 tonicity is the ability of a solution to cause water movement it is in reference to hypertonic hypotonic and isotonic cellular states tonicity differs between animal cells and plant cells since plants cells have a cell wall instead of shrinking or bursting the plant cell is considered to be plasmolyzed if it is placed in a hypertonic solution and is considered to be in its normal state if it is placed in an isotonic solution in a hypotonic solution the plant cell is considered to be in a turgid state it is very important to remember that tonicity is dependent on the water concentration or any solvent not the solute concentration if a solution is hypotonic the water concentration is greater outside the cell and so water rushes into the cell in order to equal out the water concentration this causes animal cells without a cell wall to burst and for plant cells which do have a cell wall to become turgid if the solution is isotonic the water concentration is the same on either side of the cell membrane and so while water does move from inside to outside the cell and vice versa there is no net movement of water if the solution is hypertonic the water concentraion inside the cell is greater this leads to water rushing out of the cell animal cells shrivel up and plant cells become plasmolysed this is where the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall in places as the cytoplasm shrinks note that the cell wall does not change shape it is important also to note that tonicity applies to the impermeant solutes within a solvent as opposed to osmolarity which takes into account both permeant and impermeant solutes for example urea is a permeant solute meaning it can pass the membrane freely and will not be factored when determining the tonicity of a solution on the other hand nacl is impermeant and cannot pass the membrane without the help of a concentration gradient and will therefore contribute to a solution s tonicity it is then possible for a solution to be hypotonic and yet be isoosmotic the elastic tension of living muscles arteries etc that facilitates response to stimuli clinically this is referred to as tonus see muscle tone see also osmole unit endofarticle doc doc

sledgehammer as well as hitting the vampire with his truck a few times demanding to know what happened with darla angel eventually gains the upper hand smashes lindsay s artificial hand and steals his truck returning to his apartment lindsey finds that darla had left town taking all her clothes with her lindsey is left alone beaten up both physically and emotionally consequently his work at the firm suffers but he is still in a race with lilah for the promotion hoping that his performance will pick up again with the return of his hand lindsey s superiors arrange for him to receive a mystical transplant but the new hand acts up writing kill whenever lindsey doesn t concentrate fearing that the hand is evil lindsey goes to caritas and sings for the host revealing that he used to be a regular customer and musician at caritas until he lost his hand lorne sets him and angel on the path that will end with the two working together to discover a wolfram hart facility that specializes in unwilling limb donors among them is the donor of lindsey s hand an old friend of his from his mailroom days after figuring out that his hand isn t evil but rather suicidal lindsey pulls the plug on his friend and destroys the facility while saving those that can still be saved it is then that lindsey decides to leave wolfram hart permanently in a last confrontation between angel and lindsey the two bury the hatchet and lindsey warns him of the games wolfram hart is trying to play lindsey leaves los angeles and goes on a soul searching trip including amongst other places nepal he does not reappear for two seasons season five in season five of angel lindsey finally returns to los angeles when he learns that angel has taken over the los angeles division of wolfram hart although it seemed that he and angel had buried the hatchet lindsey is unable to cope with the fact that angel has gotten so easily the job that lindsey had fought so hard for his hatred for angel returns in full force runic tattoos cover lindsey s body mystically hiding his presence from the senior partners at some unrevealed point he begins a relationship with eve for whom he shows true affection together lindsey and eve manipulate events so that spike not angel proves or at least appears to the senior partners to be the ensouled vampire foretold in the scrolls of aberjian the one who will have a crucial impact in the apocalypse and fulfill the shanshu prophecy lindsey hopes that once the senior partners realize the folly of attempting to seduce angel to their cause that he will be stripped of his position at wolfram hart leaving a power vacuum which lindsey could fill gaining a measure of revenge on angel the seeds of this plot are planted in the finale of season four of the series when angel is given the amulet which spike eventually uses to destroy the hellmouth in sunnydale deposited incorporeal in wolfram hart and unable to leave the city limits spike gradually grows attached to the city and reconsiders his initial intention to seek out buffy in europe lindsey then initiates the next stage of his plan making spike corporeal again via what is likely a spell sent in a package to spike at wolfram hart he later seeks out spike under the assumed identity of a drifter named doyle closely paralleling the initial encounters between angel and the real doyle claiming to receive visions from the powers that be he gains spike s cooperation and trust lindsey and eve contrive a situation where spike saves angel from a demonic parasite placed on an unconscious angel by eve which simultaneously disheartens angel galvanizes spike and adds weight and veracity to the claims made by doyle lindsey although the mind numbing visions that lindsey reports are non existent the events described whether revealed to lindsey through mundane or arcane means are true and for a time spike does appear the far more likely candidate to fulfill the shanshu prophecy however when cordelia seemingly returns to life it throws a monkey wrench in lindsey s plans lindsey sends spike to kill her not expecting him to succeed but it was worth a shot meanwhile he infiltrates wolfram hart when informed by eve that spike had failed lindsey activates the senior partners program meant to kill angel if he turned against them the plan is averted though as spike cordelia and angel are able to uncover lindsey s actions angel and lindsey face off in the chamber where the contingency plan is stored the pair fight on a rising container that holds the creature meant to kill angel while cordelia tries to stop the process lindsey displays the new abilities he has learned on his journeys enabling him to keep up with angel in a physical confrontation despite this angel finally defeats lindsey informing him that no matter what he tries he angel will always beat the bad guys and his comrades are able to dissolve the tattoos that protect lindsey from the senior partners wrath lindsey is incarcerated in a hell dimension which emulates suburbia complete with a wife and son time operates in a loop each day he has his heart cut out by a demon hiding in the house s basement reminiscent of the myth of prometheus he is eventually rescued by angel spike and charles gunn for information they need they are only able to leave by the sacrifice of gunn who remains behind to take lindsey s place lindsey later reveals that his plot to kill angel was also meant to make him a member of the circle of the black thorn the senior partners instrument on this plane of existence a secret society devoted to maintaining man s inhumanity to man in exchange for power he notes that while angel is sidetracked at wolfram hart the apocalypse is already underway and angel and his team are becoming more and more corrupt by the day lindsey and angel ally once more in an effort to stop the circle the two agree to fight the upcoming battle together and at the end resolve their differences maybe even allowing lindsey to take a powerful position at wolfram hart as the devil they know at least that is the plan lindsey destroys the sahrvin demon clan with lorne s assistance as planned however angel believes that lindsey can never be trusted and that he will never be a force for good consequently angel secretly instructs lorne to assassinate lindsey after the sahrvin are defeated taking two bullets in the chest as lorne informs lindsey that he will never be a part of the solution a stunned lindsey staggers back and slumps down by a wall outraged and humiliated at being killed by in his own words a flunky rather than his nemesis angel powers and abilities thanks to an unrevealed mystical process lindsey became gifted with strength speed and endurance on a par with angel as well as rune tattoos meant to hide him from all known surveillance methods other than the naked eye he was also capable of transmuting a small blade into a sword and was an adept swordsman in addition lindsey had telekinetic abilities until the removal of his strumming hand he was also a competent guitarist trivia lindsey is the only character besides angel himself to appear in both the first and last episodes of angel christian kane originally auditioned for the role of riley finn on buffy the vampire slayer in you re welcome lindsey calls angel a corporate puppet two episodes later angel does literally become a puppet in the episode smile time christian kane lends his real singing voice to the episode dead end causing a humorous and seemingly jealous reaction by angel in caritas though christian kane is a guitar player as well as a singer it is his kane band mate steve carlson that lends his hands for the performance shots during the caritas scene in dead end the fleur de lis bracelet that lindsey wears throughout his time on the show is actually a bracelet that christian kane wears to remind him of his mother who is from new orleans endofarticle doc doc 
  
 id=5295145 title bitter work nonfiltered 184 processed 184 dbindex 450184 bitter work is an episode from the animated television series which airs on nickelodeon it is the ninth episode of the second season of the series when aang struggles with a block while trying to learn earthbending from toph he wonders if the problem is with him or his teacher meanwhile sokka gets himself in a jam episode synopsis aang awakes from his sleep excited that he will finally begin his earthbending training with toph he enthusiastically asks her what they will do first and toph replies that they will simply learn how to move a rock toph teaches aang that earthbending requires a firm steady stance she demonstrates the technique by sending a rock into a wall aang tries to emulate her but he ends up hitting the rock with airbending and propels himself backwards meanwhile iroh awakes to find his nephew zuko watching over him zuko explains that iroh was knocked unconscious after a surprise attack by azula they are in a partially destroyed home in the abandoned town presented the end of the last episode zuko says that he has contemplated and realized that he will eventually encounter azula again he wants to learn more advanced firebending techniques so he can defeat her to zuko s surprise iroh agrees with him meanwhile aang is trying to figure out why he could not move the rock since he did the correct stance he tries to find an alternate solution but toph explains that creative thinking is the problem earthbending requires a head on approach aang then trains by doing several activities involving rocks he starts to become successful with the many different training activities meanwhile sokka who is alone is hiding in a tree he spots a small cute but unidentifiable creature sokka comically states that even though it is cute it is still made of meat he then jumps down from the tree to attack it however he falls into a crack in the ground without his arms to use he is stuck in the crack meanwhile iroh explains how firebenders can create lightning lightning requires peace of mind it does not use aggression unlike the other forms of firebending iroh continues to explain how to create lightning positive energy and negative energy must be separated creating an imbalance possibly the positively and negatively charged protons and electrons when the different energies recombine tension is released creating lightning he successfully demonstrates how to make lightning then zuko tries to create it however he just creates a fire blast and flies backwards similar to the way aang made an air blast while trying to earthbend meanwhile toph decides that aang will stop a rock toph puts a blindfold around aang s eyes and rolls a boulder down a steep hill towards him aang then flinches and jumps over the rock toph yells at aang and calls him a wimp katara tries to console aang by teaching him some more waterbending zuko is still unsuccessful with lightning creating another explosion iroh determines that zuko s turmoil inside him is preventing him from creating lightning zuko still has some pride even though he has been humbled iroh decides to teach zuko a move that he made up himself meanwhile sokka is contemplating in the crack in the ground he is then convinced that he will be a vegetarian if he can escape out of the crack in a marsh aang is moving a small mass of water with katara she tries to tell aang to face the issue instead of avoiding it aang however is unable to do that katara explains that aang is working with his opposite element earth katara then surprises aang by throwing a reed at him aang is able to use water to cut the reed into two pieces before it reaches him katara congratulates aang for having reflexes of a master waterbender and aang replies to her as sifu teacher katara iroh gives further detail about the four nations to zuko the fire nation symbolizes power and desire the earth kingdom symbolizes endurance and diversity the air nomads symbolize freedom from worldly concerns and the water tribes symbolize love and community especially in the face of change he explains that people can gain wisdom by understanding each other iroh learned his special move by understanding the waterbenders meanwhile toph taunts aang about his submissiveness by abusing his staff she walks away but katara arrives saying that sokka has not been found yet aang and katara split up to search for sokka sokka is ready to give up meat and sarcasm in order to escape from the crack in the ground this is proven to be hypocrisy when aang finds him and sokka immediately asks aang if he has any meat and responds to aang s inability to free him with sarcasm aang tries but is unable to use airbending to free him sokka requests that he should get toph to help but aang feels too scared to ask her for help consequently sokka remains in the hole the critter returns and aang identifies it as a saber tooth moose lion cub then the mother of the cub arrives and she is furious iroh begins to teach zuko how to redirect lightning lightning goes through one arm into the stomach and out the other arm they practice the hand motion to feel the pathway when zuko thinks he has mastered it he demands that uncle iroh strike him with lightning however iroh refuses because of the possibility of hurting his nephew zuko then leaves to find his own lightning as a storm is approaching the mother sabertooth moose lion starts to attack aang and sokka aang tries to initially avoid it but he eventually faces the mother head on and sends her away toph who was silently observing the conflict congratulates aang but aang demands that she give his staff back toph then says that aang is thinking like an earthbender aang successfully earthbends a rock toph then drags sokka out of the hole aang toph and sokka find katara who is relieved that sokka has been found at the end of the episode zuko stands atop a mountain yelling into the storm as the lightning crackles overhead he dares the storm to strike him in the hope of being able to practice what his uncle just taught him and in some way seek an end to his misery but the storm seeming to mock him does not oblige zuko who suddenly sheds a tear falls to his knees crying out in anguish notes iroh s son lu ten is seen for the first time toph s delivery of good morning earthbending student is crooned in the same way as adrian cronauer s good morning vietnam it is confirmed that iroh is able to create lightning iroh s explanation of how firebending creates lightning that is by separation of positive and negative energy closely matches the scientific explanation for how lightning is actually formed through separation of positive and negative charges aang earthbends for the first time outside of the avatar state and has now bended all four elements iroh mentions that in order to redirect lightning it must be channeled from one arm through the stomach to the other arm having it flow through the heart can be very dangerous even fatal this is scientifically true where electricity can be used to start or stop the heart during cardiac arrest iroh invented his redirection of lighting technique through his studies of the waterbenders and their ability to deal with the flow of energy his description of the sea of chi during his explanation of the technique is drawn directly from the taoist practices of chi kung and tai chi on which waterbending is based when zuko weeps at the end of the episode his scarred eye does not shed any tears it is interesting to note that when his healthy eye opens all the way the scarred one remains still but when zuko closes his right eye the left shuts evenly with it this suggests that the scar has affected his tear duct and eyelid muscle rather than just his skin the diagram that iroh draws into the ground presents each of the elements and arranges them in opposing forces water is the opposite of fire and air is the opposite of earth it is important to recognize that the bottom two elements air and fire are mainly identified with emotions the top two elements earth and water represent worldly attributes of intrepidity and community respectively katara s and toph s teaching styles are both defined in this episode as two of the four consequences of operant conditioning katara suggests to toph that her use of positive reinforcement has helped aang toph however uses negative punishment in order to change aang s attitude aang addresses toph and later katara as sifu which means teacher in cantonese it is most commonly used in martial arts schools references screencaps for bitter work courtesy of avatar spirit net endofarticle doc doc 
  
 id=465326 title russian apartment bombings nonfiltered 185 processed 185 dbindex 450185 the russian apartment bombings were a series of bombings in russia that killed nearly 300 people and led the country into the second chechen war they happened over a span of two weeks in 1999 the russian authorities directed by prime minister vladimir putin blamed the bombings on chechen separatists and in response ordered the invasion of chechnya however former fsb officer alexander litvinenko johns hopkins university and hoover institute scholar david satter and russian lawmaker sergei yushenkov asserted that the bombings were in fact a false flag attack perpetrated by the fsb in order to legitimate the resumption of military activities in chechnya and bring vladimir putin and fsb to power the bombings the first bombing which did not target an apartment occurred in moscow the russian capital on august 31 1999 a bomb exploded in a mall killing one person and leaving 40 others wounded a note was left saying the bombing was a result of increasing russian consumerism buynaksk on september 4 1999 a car bomb detonated outside an apartment building housing russian soldiers in the city of buynaksk in the province of dagestan sixty four people were killed and dozens of others were wounded russia blamed separatists from chechnya and days later invaded the province of dagestan moscow pechatniki on september 8 1999 300 kg to 400 kg of explosives detonated on the ground floor of an apartment building in southeast moscow the nine story building was destroyed killing 94 people inside and wounded 150 others a total of 108 apartments were destroyed during the bombing a caller to a russian news agency said the blast was a response to recent russian bombing of chechen and dagestan villages in response to the invasion of dagestan moscow kashirskoye highway september 13 1999 was supposed to be a day of mourning for the victims of the previous bomb attacks but on that day a large bomb exploded at an apartment on kashirskoye highway in southern moscow the eight story building was flattened littering the street with debris and throwing some concrete hundreds of yards away in all 118 people died and 200 were wounded it was at this time when russian prime minister vladimir putin declared a war against the illegal military units in chechnya though there was not much evidence pointing to chechens preparations were made by the russian military forces to re enter the province and to strip the chechen government of its powers volgodonsk the motive for the forceful solution was clinched when a truck bomb exploded september 16 1999 outside a nine story apartment complex in the southern russian city of volgodonsk killing 17 people in response russia launched air strikes on chechen rebel positions oil refineries and other buildings inside that province by the end of september it was clear another war over chechnya was underway and by october russian troops had entered the province the attacks would not be the last in russia or chechnya ryazan incident on the evening of september 22 1999 an alert resident of an apartment building in the town of ryazan noticed strangers moving heavy sugar sacks into the basement from a car militia the local police were called to the site and all residents were evacuated the first test of the powder from the sacks showed the presence of an explosive all roads from the town were brought under heavy surveillance but no leads were found a telephone service employee tapped into long distance phone conversations managed to detect a conversation in which an out of town person suggested to take care and to watch for patrols that person s number was found to belong to an fsb office in moscow federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti declared that the incident was a training exercise forty eight hours later the original chemical test was declared inaccurate due to contamination of the analysis apparatus from a previous test the public inquiry committee could not come to a complete conclusion on this and other incidents due to incoherent answers from federal bodies the general prosecutor s office has closed the criminal investigation of the ryazan incident in april 2000 official investigation according to the official investigation the apartment bombings were planned and organized by amir khattab and abu umar arab militants fighting in chechnya on the side of chechen insurgents both of whom were later killed the planning was carried out in khattab s guerilla camps in chechnya caucasus in shatoy and taliban in avtury this particular operation was led by an ethnic karachay achemez gochiyayev the explosives were prepared in urus martan chechnya at the fertilizer factory by mixing hexogen tnt aluminium powder and nitre with sugar from there they have been sent to a food storage facility in kislovodsk which was managed by an uncle of one of the terrorists yusuf krymshakhalov another conspirator ruslan magayayev had leased a kamaz truck which the sacks were stored in for two months after everything was planned the participants were organized into several groups which transported the explosives to different cities most of the people participating were not ethnic chechens according to official version the following people either delivered explosives stored them or harbored other suspects moscow bombings achemez gochiyayev has not been arrested denis saitakov killed in chechnya khakim abayev killed by fsb special forces in may 2004 in ingushetia ravil akhmyarov killed in

parliamentary investigation of the ryazan incident duma on a pro kremlin party block vote voted to seal all materials related to ryazan incident for the next 75 years and forbade an investigation of what really happened an independent public commission to investigate the bombings chaired by duma deputy sergei kovalev was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries two key members of the kovalev commission sergei yushenkov and yuri shchekochikhin both duma members have since died in apparent assassinations in april 2003 and july 2003 respectively the commission s lawyer mikhail trepashkin has been arrested in october 2003 to become one of the better known political prisoners in russia another member of the commission otto lacis was brutally beaten in november 2003 and two years later on 3rd of november 2005 dies in the hospital after a car accident theory of fsb involvement the ryazan incident on september 22 1999 prompted the initial speculation in the western press that the moscow bombings were organized by the fsb the russian domestic intelligence service the fsb were caught by local police and citizens in the city of ryazan planting a bomb with a detonator in the basement of an apartment building at the address of 14 16 novosyelov on the night of september 22 1999 explosives experts arriving at the scene found that the bomb tested positive for hexogen i e rdx on september 24 1999 nikolai patrushev the head of the fsb said on the ntv channel that the bomb in the basement of the apartment had been a dummy and that the fsb had been conducting a test the fsb claimed that the gas analyzer that detected hexogen had malfunctioned and that the substance in the dummy bomb was sugar yet yuri tkachenko the explosives expert who defused the bomb insisted that it was real tkachenko said that the explosives including a timer power source and detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional he also said that the gas analyzer that tested the vapors coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of hexogen tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyzer could have malfunctioned as the gas analyzer was of world class quality costing 20 000 and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule checking the analyzer after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyzer was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad s experts depended on the reliability of their equipment the police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that the incident was not an exercise and that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar alexander litvinenko a former fsb agent alleged that agents from the fsb co ordinated the apartment block bombings on 29 december 2003 russian authorities confiscated over 5000 copies of the book en route to moscow from the publisher in latvia alexander litvinenko was murdered in london in november 2006 boris berezovsky supported a documentary film fsb blows up russia an assault on russia financing 25 of the costs the film accused russian special services of organising the explosions in volgodonsk and moscow according to research carried out by two french journalists jean charles deniau and charles gazelle the explosions were carried out by fsb to provide justification for the continuance of the chechen war which in turn helped putin beat the communists in the presidential election of 2000 there is some doubt concerning berezovsky s impartiality in this case as he allegedly had extensive business dealings with chechen rebels however nearly 40 of the russians gave credence to berezovsky s accusations at the time in april 2002 on a visit to washington duma member sergei yushenkov pointed to a mysterious remark by the duma speaker gennady seleznev from which it appeared that seleznev had known about one of the explosions three days before the fact in fact seleznyov was referring to an unrelated explosion which indeed happened in volgodonsk three days earlier an independent documentary nedoverie disbelief about the bombing controversy by russian director andrei nekrasov was premiered at the 2004 sundance film festival the film chronicles the story of tatyana and alyona morozova the two russian american sisters who had lost their mother in the attack and decided to find out who did it on may 20 2004 an article in the los angeles times described the conviction on an unrelated state secret charge of mikhail trepashkin appointed by a public committee set up by four members of the russian parliament to investigate the bombings trepashkin was arrested shortly before he was to make his findings public the article states that fsb agent vladimir romanovich was identified by several witnesses as the man who rented the basement of one of the bombed buildings romanovich subsequently died in a car crash in cyprus trepashkin s wife declared that his conviction was punishment for publicizing uncomfortable truths about the bombing on 18 january 2003 yuri felshtinsky provided novaya gazeta with a video recording and its transcript computer translation the video dated 20 august 2002 contained an interview with somebody claimed to be gochiyayev the authors edited out the names of an fsb agent and another person from the interviewee s story the authors asked for money in exchange for the missing details in february 2005 yuri felshtinsky received an audio cassette and a written statement from an unnamed mediator without pay the statement made by gochiyayev or

 id=16736 title kurt gödel nonfiltered 198 processed 197 dbindex 450198 kurt gödel ipa april 28 1906 brno then austria hungary now czech republic january 14 1978 princeton new jersey was an austrian logician mathematician and philosopher of mathematics one of the most significant logicians of all time gödel s work has had immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century a time when many such as bertrand russell a n whitehead and david hilbert were attempting to use logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics gödel is best known for his two incompleteness theorems published in 1931 when he was 25 years of age and only one year after finishing his doctorate at the university of vienna the more famous incompleteness theorem states that for any self consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers peano arithmetic there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms to prove this theorem gödel developed a technique now known as gödel numbering which codes formal expressions as natural numbers he also showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory if those axioms are consistent he made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic intuitionistic logic and modal logic life childhood kurt friedrich gödel was born april 28 1906 in brno german brünn moravia austria hungary now the czech republic into the ethnic german family of rudolf gödel the manager of a textile factory and marianne gödel born handschuh at the time of his birth the town had a slight german speaking majority and this was the language of his parents he automatically became a czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the austro hungarian empire broke up at the end of world war i he later told his biographer john d dawson that he felt like an exiled austrian in czechoslovakia ein österreichischer verbannter in tschechoslowakien during this time he was never able to speak czech and refused to learn it at school he became an austrian citizen by choice at age 23 when nazi germany annexed austria gödel automatically became a german citizen at age 32 after world war ii at the age of 42 he became a naturalized american citizen in his family young kurt was known as der herr warum mr why because of his insatiable curiosity according to his brother rudolf at the age of six or seven kurt suffered from rheumatic fever he completely recovered but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage he attended german language primary and secondary school in brno and completed them with honors in 1923 although kurt had first excelled in languages he later became more interested in history and mathematics his interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother rudolf born 1902 left for vienna to go to medical school at the university of vienna uv during his teens kurt studied gabelsberger shorthand goethe s theory of colours and criticisms of isaac newton and the writings of immanuel kant studying in vienna at the age of 18 kurt joined his brother rudolf in vienna and entered the uv by that time he had already mastered university level mathematics although initially intending to study theoretical physics kurt also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy during this time he adopted ideas of mathematical realism he read kant s metaphysische anfangsgründe der naturwissenschaft and participated in the vienna circle with moritz schlick hans hahn and rudolf carnap kurt then studied number theory but when he took part in a seminar run by moritz schlick which studied bertrand russell s book introduction to mathematical philosophy kurt became interested in mathematical logic attending a lecture by david hilbert in bologna on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set gödel s life course in 1928 hilbert and wilhelm ackermann published grundzüge der theoretischen logik principles of theoretical logic an introduction to first order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system this was the topic chosen by gödel for his doctorate work in 1929 at the age of 23 he completed his doctoral dissertation under hans hahn s supervision in it gödel established the completeness of the first order predicate calculus this result is known as gödel s completeness theorem he was awarded the doctorate in 1930 his thesis along with some additional work was published by the vienna academy of science working in vienna in 1931 gödel published his famous incompleteness theorems in über formal unentscheidbare sätze der principia mathematica und verwandter systeme in that article he proved that for any computable axiomatic system that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers e g the peano axioms or zfc then the system cannot be both consistent and complete this is generally known as the incompleteness theorem the consistency of the axioms cannot be proved within the system these theorems ended a half century of attempts beginning with the work of frege and culminating in principia mathematica and hilbert s formalism to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics the incompleteness theorems also imply that not all mathematical questions are computable in hindsight the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple gödel essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system if it were provable it would be false which contradicts the fact that provable statements are always true thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement that is for any humanly constructible set of axioms for arithmetic there is a formula which obtains in arithmetic but which is not provable in that system to make this precise however gödel needed to solve several technical issues such as encoding statements proofs and the very concept of provability into the natural numbers he did this using a process known as gödel numbering gödel earned his habilitation at the uv in 1932 and in 1933 he became a privatdozent unpaid lecturer there hitler s 1933 ascension in germany had little effect on gödel in vienna as he took little interest in politics he was however much affected by the 1936 murder of moritz schlick whose seminar had aroused gödel s interest in logic by a deranged student which resulted in gödel s first nervous breakdown visits to the usa in 1933 gödel first traveled to the usa where he met albert einstein who became a good friend he delivered an address to the annual meeting of the american mathematical society during this year gödel also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he delivered a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth this work was developed in number theory using gödel numbering in 1934 gödel gave a series of lectures at the institute for advanced study ias in princeton new jersey entitled on undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems stephen kleene who had just completed his ph d at princeton took notes of these lectures which have been subsequently published gödel would visit the ias again in the autumn of 1935 the traveling and the hard work had exhausted him and the next year he had to recover from a depression he returned to teaching in 1937 during this time he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis he would go on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory he married adele nimbursky née porkert whom he had known for over 10 years on september 20 1938 their relationship had been opposed by his parents on the grounds that she was a divorced dancer six years older than he they had no children subsequently he left for another visit to the usa spending the autumn of 1938 at the ias and the spring of 1939 at the university of notre dame princeton after the anschluss in 1938 austria had become a part of nazi germany germany abolished the title of privatdozent so gödel had to apply for a different position under the new order his former association with jewish members of the vienna circle especially with hahn weighed against him his predicament precipitated when he was found fit for military service and was now at risk of being conscripted into the german army world war ii started in september 1939 in january 1940 gödel and his wife left europe due to the difficulty of an atlantic crossing they took the trans siberian railway and passed through japan en route to the u s arriving in san francisco california on march 4 1940 they crossed the u s by train so that gödel could take up a position at the ias in princeton new jersey gödel very quickly resumed his mathematical work in 1940 he published his work consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis with the axioms of set theory which is a classic of modern mathematics in that work he introduced the constructible universe a model of set theory in which the only sets which exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets gödel showed that both the axiom of choice ac and the generalized continuum hypothesis gch are true in the constructible universe and therefore must be consistent with the zermelo frankel axioms for set theory zf paul cohen later constructed a model of zf in which ac and gch are false together these proofs mean that ac and gch are independent of the zf axioms for set theory during his many years at the institute gödel s interests turned to philosophy and physics he studied and admired the works of gottfried leibniz but came around to the unsupported belief that most of leibniz s works had been suppressed to a lesser extent he studied kant and edmund husserl in the early 1970s gödel circulated among his friends an elaboration of leibniz s ontological proof of god s existence this is now known as gödel s ontological proof in the late 1940s gödel demonstrated the existence of paradoxical solutions to albert einstein s field equations in general relativity these rotating universes would allow time travel and caused einstein to have doubts about his own theory gödel became a permanent member of the ias in 1946 around this time he stopped publishing though he continued to work he became a full professor at the institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976 gödel was awarded with julian schwinger the first albert einstein award in 1951 and was also awarded the national medal of science in 1974 psychological disorder gödel was shy withdrawn and eccentric he would wear warm winter clothing in the middle of summer in the middle of winter he would leave all of the windows open in his home because he believed that conspirators were trying to assassinate him with poison gas he was a somewhat sickly man and was prescribed specific diets and medical regimens by doctors but gödel often ignored their advice or even would do the opposite of what his prescription indicated this caused him to suffer further illness in the 1940s he suffered from a bleeding ulcer but his distrust of doctors led him to delay treatment he risked death and was saved only by emergency blood transfusion amongst his delusions was the belief that unknown villains were trying to kill him by poisoning his food for this reason gödel would only eat his wife s cooking refusing to even eat his own cooking for fear of being poisoned death late in 1977 adele became incapacitated due to illness and so could no longer cook for gödel due to his paranoia he refused to eat any food at all and thus died of malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance in princeton hospital on january 14 1978 he weighed 65 pounds legacy the kurt gödel society founded in 1987 was named in his honor it is an international organization for the promotion of research in the areas of logic philosophy and the history of mathematics gödel s friendship with einstein gödel had a most distinguished coach for his citizenship exam albert einstein who had earlier earned his own citizenship and who was concerned that his friend s unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his chances einstein accompanied gödel to the hearing to everyone s consternation gödel suddenly informed the presiding judge that he had discovered a way in which a dictatorship could be legally installed in the united states through a logical contradiction in the u s constitution fortunately the judge who was apparently a very patient person took this in good part and awarded gödel his citizenship see einstein and gödel had a legendary friendship shared in the walks they took together to and from the institute for advanced studies the nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other institute members economist oskar morgenstern recounts that toward the end of his life einstein confided that his own work no longer meant much that he came to the institute merely to have the

 id=981899 title buyer decision processes nonfiltered 228 processed 227 dbindex 450228 buyer decision processes are the decision making processes undertaken by consumers in regard to a potential market transaction before during and after the purchase of a product or service more generally decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action from among multiple alternatives common examples include shopping deciding what to eat decision making is said to be a psychological construct this means that although we can never see a decision we can infer from observable behaviour that a decision has been made therefore we conclude that a psychological event that we call decision making has occurred it is a construction that imputes commitment to action that is based on observable actions we assume that people have made a commitment to effect the action in general there are three ways of analysing consumer buying decisions they are economic models these models are largely quantitative and are based on the assumptions of rationality and near perfect knowledge the consumer is seen to maximize their utility see consumer theory game theory can also be used in some circumstances psychological models these models concentrate on psychological and cognitive processes such as motivation and need reduction they are qualitative rather than quantitative and build on sociological factors like cultural influences and family influences consumer behaviour models these are practical models used by marketers they typically blend both economic and psychological models nobel laureate herbert simon sees economic decision making as a vain attempt to be rational he claims in 1947 and 1957 that if a complete analysis is to be done a decision will be immensely complex he also says that peoples information processing ability is very limited the assumption of a perfectly rational economic actor is unrealistic often we are influenced by emotional and non rational considerations when we try to be rational we are at best only partially successful models of buyer decision making in an early study of the buyer decision process literature frank nicosia nicosia f 1966 pp 9 21 identified three types of buyer decision making models they are the univariate model he called it the simple scheme in which only one behavioural determinant was allowed in a stimulus response type of relationship the multi variate model he called it a reduced form scheme in which numerous independent variables were assumed to determine buyer behaviour and finally the system of equations model he called it a structural scheme or process scheme in which numerous functional relations either univariate or multi variate interact in a complex system of equations he concluded that only this third type of model is capable of expressing the complexity of buyer decision processes in chapter 7 nicosia builds a comprehensive model involving five modules the encoding module includes determinants like attributes of the brand environmental factors consumer s attributes attributes of the organization and attributes of the message other modules in the system include consumer decoding search and evaluation decision and consumption general model a general model of the buyer decision process consists of the following steps want recognition search of information on products that could satisfy the needs of the buyer alternative selection decision making on buying the product post purchase behavior there are a range of alternative models but that of aiuapr which most directly links to the steps in the marketing promotional process is often seen as the most generally useful awareness before anything else can happen the potential customers must become aware that the product or service exists thus the first task must be to gain the attention of the target audience all the different models are predictably agreed on this first step if the audience never hears the message they will not act on it no matter how powerful it is interest but it is not sufficient to grab their attention the message must interest them and persuade them that the product or service is relevant to their needs the content of the message s must therefore be meaningful and clearly relevant to that target audience s needs and this is where marketing research can come into its own understanding once an interest is established the prospective customer must be able to appreciate how well the offering may meet his or her needs again as revealed by the marketing research this may be no mean achievement where the copywriter has just fifty words or ten seconds to convey everything there is to say about it attitudes but the message must go even further to persuade the reader to adopt a sufficiently positive attitude towards the product or service that he or she will purchase it albeit as a trial there is no adequate way of describing how this may be achieved it is simply down to the magic of the copywriters art based on the strength of the product or service itself purchase all the above stages might happen in a few minutes while the reader is considering the advertisement in the comfort of his or her favourite armchair the final buying decision on the other hand may take place some time later perhaps weeks later when the prospective buyer actually tries to find a shop which stocks the product repeat purchase but in most cases this first purchase is best viewed as just a trial purchase only if the experience is a success for the customer will it be turned into repeat purchases these repeats not the single purchase which is the focus of most models are where the vendors focus should be for these are where the profits are generated the earlier stages are merely a very necessary prerequisite for this this is a very simple model and as such does apply quite generally its lessons are that you cannot obtain repeat purchasing without going through the stages of building awareness and then obtaining trial use which has to be successful it is a pattern which applies to all repeat purchase products and services industrial goods just as much as baked beans this simple theory is rarely taken any further to look at the series of transactions which such repeat purchasing implies the consumer s growing experience over a number of such transactions is often the determining factor in the later and future purchases all the succeeding transactions are thus interdependent and the overall decision making process may accordingly be much more complex than most models allow for decision making style according to i b myers a person s decision making process depends to a significant degree on their cognitive style a study was performed to explore how different cognitive styles affect the decisions of people subjects were classified into two different cognitive styles type a and type b and were to engage in a task that involved making decisions cheng 39 the analysis in cheng s study shows that type a personalities with a mean score 6 627 performed significantly better than people with type b personalities with a mean score of 4 446 in making decisions for this task 56 57 this shows that a person s decision making process depends upon their cognitive style the relationship between decision style and the behavior of decision makers identifies an individual s decision making style determining decision making style through the myers briggs type indicator starting from the work of carl jung myers developed the myers briggs type indicator mbti a personality test designed to identify a person s preferences using a set of four bi polar dimensions the mbti is tested to be accurate in determining people s personality types it exceeds 70 accuracy when determining a person s personality dimensions gardner 46 50 the eight preferences on these dimensions are thinking and feeling extraversion and introversion judgment and perception and sensing and intuition in its basic form the test consists of a series of forced choice questions that represent behavioral preferences e g at a party i like to tell jokes to others or listen to others and preferred self descriptive adjectives e g daring or cautious the results are tabulated to indicate the preferences for each of the four scales extroversion introversion ei sensing intuition sn thinking feeling tf and judgment perception jp pittenger 470 a person s personality type helps determine their decision making style a person s decision making style is based largely on how they score on the four dimensions of the mbti for example an experiment by henderson determined how decision style influenced the likelihood of people adopting children with a perception of risk 381 different types of people s personalities received from the mbti were tested sf s sensation feeling were most likely to adopt with 70 who saw very little risk and 58 of st s sensation thinking were least likely to adopt who saw more of a risk the amount of risk involved in adoption was influential in different personality decision making 54 of sf s would adopt at a high risk for complications while only 37 of st s would adopt henderson 382 people with different personalities and cognitive styles make different decisions which can be determined using the mbti people use all eight personality types of the mbti but only one from each of the four basic preferences is generally favored someone that scored near the extroversion sensing thinking and judgment end of the dimensions would tend to have a logical analytical objective critical and empirical decision making style the combination of these four preferences results in the psychological type in this example e s t j extroversion is the preference that relates to drawing energy from outside oneself in the external world of peers activities and things kennedy 39 sensing is the preference for paying attention to information that is perceived directly through the five senses and focusing on what actually exists thinking relates to organizing and structuring information to decide in a logical and objective way judgment relates to living a planned and organized life kennedy 39 how a person scores on the four personality scales determines their decision making style using the mbti people can predetermine how others will make decisions by determining their personalities over three million people a year complete the mbti and nearly 40 of major corporations use this for team building hiring and management development gardner 45 the mbti helps many people including managers and marketers determine employees and buyers personalities and decision making styles to make the best outcome for their business validation testing of the myers briggs type indicator to test the reliability of the mbti many test retest procedures have been done according to marcia carlyn the mbti has been proven to be accurate by having the same person retake the test after a period of time and end up with the same personality dimensions 70 of the time 465 in 1996 j a wright studied 94 elementary school teachers who were retested six years after they had originally taken the mbti 61 of them remained in the same category in all four dimensions in each category 83 of e i types 89 of s n types 90 of t f types and 90 of j p types had no change carlyn 467 a study of content validity in the mbti was performed by bradway in 1964 he tested 28 people who studied jung s theory carlyn 487 the jungian analysts classified themselves in each category as either an e i s n and t f then they were given the mbti and compared their self typing and the actual mbti typing 100 of their own thought and the mbti agreed on e i classification 68 agreed on s n classification 61 agreed on the t f classification and 43 agreed on all three dimensions carlyn 468 group decision making process group composition creates better decision making skills with different personalities working together in a study by volkema groups were composed on the basis of cognitive style some groups had one type of dimension from the mbti s j s and other groups had multiple dimensions a mix of n t n f s j s p 112 in order to analyze their decision making styles each group was hypothetically placed in a life threatening situation and had to rank a list of 15 items in order of importance each person ranked the items individually and then with their group comparing each score with the correct survival ranking score determined how people s decision making was affected in groups the average group score was 7 6 points better than the average individual score the average score for groups with multiple personalities was 10 8 points better and for groups with the same personality dimensions was 4 4 points better than individuals volkema 114 16 working in groups with a variety of people composed of multiple personalities and cognitive styles often produces a better outcome in decision making rather than individually cognitive and personal biases in decision making it is generally agreed that biases can creep into our decision making processes calling into question the correctness of a decision below is a list of some of the more common cognitive biases selective search for evidence we tend to be willing to gather facts that support certain conclusions but disregard other facts that support different conclusions premature termination of search for evidence we tend to accept the first alternative that looks like it might work conservatism and inertia unwillingness to change thought patterns that we have used in the past in the face of new circumstances experiential limitations unwillingness or inability to look beyond the scope of our past experiences rejection of the unfamiliar selective perception we actively screen out information that we do not think is salient wishful thinking or optimism we tend to want to see things in a positive light and this can distort our perception and thinking recency we tend to place more attention on more recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information repetition bias a willingness to believe what we have been told most often and by the greatest number of different of sources anchoring decisions are unduly influenced by initial information that shapes our view of subsequent information group think peer pressure to conform to the opinions held by the group source credibility bias we reject something if we have a bias against the person organization or group to which the person belongs we are inclined to accept a statement by someone we like incremental decision making and escalating commitment we look at a decision as a small step in a process and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions this can be contrasted with zero based decision making inconsistency the unwillingness to apply the same decision criteria in similar situations attribution asymmetry we tend to attribute our success to our abilities and talents but we attribute our failures to bad luck and external factors we attribute other s success to good luck and their failures to their mistakes role fulfilment we conform to the decision making expectations that others have of someone in our position underestimating uncertainty and the illusion of control we tend to underestimate future uncertainty because we tend to believe we have more control over events than we really do faulty generalizations in order to simplify an extremely complex world we tend to group things and people these simplifying generalizations can bias decision making processes ascription of causality we tend to ascribe causation even when the evidence only suggests correlation just

 id=663585 title green grow the rushes o nonfiltered 258 processed 257 dbindex 450259 green grow the rushes o aka the twelve prophet or the carol of the twelve numbers or the teaching song is a folk song popular in england scotland and wales the song is extremely old first recorded in hebrew in the 16th century and probably much older than that at the present it is sometimes sung as a christmas carol the song is not to be confused with robert burns green grow the rashes o with which it shares only the title it is cumulative in structure with each verse built up from the previous verse by appending a new stanza the first verse is i ll sing you one o green grow the rushes o what is your one o one is one and all alone and evermore shall be it so the twelfth is i ll sing you twelve o green grow the rushes o what are your twelve o twelve for the twelve apostles eleven for the eleven who went to heaven ten for the ten commandments nine for the nine bright shiners eight for the april rainers or april showerers or occasionally eight for the eight bold rangers seven for the seven stars in the sky six for the six proud walkers five for the symbols at your door four for the gospel makers three three the rivals two two lily white boys clothèd all in green o one is one and all alone sometimes one is one and one alone or one is one and stands alone and evermore shall be it so the lyrics of the song are in many places extremely obscure and present an unusual mixture of christian catechesis astronomical mnemonics and what may very well be pagan cosmology the song s origins are uncertain but the first recorded instance of it is in hebrew it may have originated in the intricacies of medieval jewish thought although the kabbalistic mystics were seldom interested in composing songs a parallel may also be drawn with the jewish passover song echad mi yodeia who knows 1 where e g 5 represents the books of the pentateuch 2 represents the luchot habrit the stone tablets on which the 10 commandments are said to have been written and one represents our lord our lord our lord who is in the heavens and the earth green grow the rushes o sounds sufficiently out of place that one is inclined to ascribe it to the same origin as fine flowers in the valley in one version of the ballad the cruel mother namely an attempt to turn a misremembered line of gaelic into something that it sounds like in english however the song did not originate in the british isles thus the line must have been included for a conscious reason or been the product of an earlier disruption twelve is almost certainly the twelve apostles of jesus although the number has other meanings it may originally have referred to the months of the year for example the eleven are the eleven apostles who remained faithful minus judas iscariot or possibly st ursula and her companions ten are fairly obviously the ten commandments given to moses the nine may be an astronomical reference although counting the sun moon and planets known before 1781 yields at most 8 not 9 it could potentially refer to the nine orders or choirs of angels the april rainers refer to the hyades star cluster called the rainy hyades in classical times and rising with the sun in april the greeks thought of them as inaugurating the april rains eight bold rangers is a very recent corruption most likely the unfortunate consequence of singers with more knowledge of tolkien than greece the seven are probably the seven sisters the pleiades star cluster or perhaps ursa major the big dipper they may also be the planets or other stars alternatively the seven stars are those referred to in revelation chapter 1 they are first cited in verse 16 as being held in the right hand of christ and then explained as referring to seven angels of the seven early christian churches the six seems to be a historical reference but remains obscure it is possible that they were members of a saxon warband who beat the bounds of their fortified camp in a traditional way between a d 450 and a d 1066 perhaps it is a biblical reference to ezekiel 9 2 six men with swords come in a vision of the prophet to slaughter the people whose leaders 8 16 have committed such sins as turning east to worship the sun and have filled the land with violence it may also be a corruption of waters but what the six bold waters might refer to remains unanswered five for the symbols at your door probably refers to the practice of putting a pentagram at the door of a house to ward off witches and evil spirits this was relatively common in the late middle ages and the early modern period and is alluded to in no shortage of literary works from or set in those eras it can also refer to the five books of moses the pentateuch an alternative interpretation is given by john timpson in his book timpson s england where he states that it refers to five symbols displayed above the doorways of houses that would shelter catholic priests he gives an example a house where these can still be seen four refers to the four evangelists mathew mark luke and john some have suggested that the three are the trinity but this leaves the rivals unexplained the i ching contains the interesting proverb that when three meet together doubts arise among them although it probably has no bearing on the interpretation of this song the three could also refer to the 3 major religious traditions of islam judaism and christianity the three could also refer to the synoptic gospels of matthew mark and luke alluding to the previous line these three give similar though slightly different accounts of the life of christ or the three rivals could be peter james and john who are often mentioned together in the gospels and at one time a dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest luke 22 24 some suggest the three are three similar and adjacent mountains in wales the two remain obscure jesus and john the baptist have been suggested possibly they are the holly and the ivy although the holly berry is red the ivy berry is black both have white wood and are evergreen pagan tradition also has the holly and the ivy as male and female so they are not both boys possibly they are holly and mistletoe white berries with green branches which would align more closely with the tradition of the defeat at yule of the holly king by the oak king mistletoe traditionally grows on oak trees although it will grow on other types of tree robert graves suggested that they are the holly king and oak king there is some suggestion that the two may be the old and new testaments perhaps referring to some mediaeval tradition although clad all in green strongly suggests that the two boys were in some way connected with the growth of plants another explanation is that the statues of st john and our lady which in christian churches flank the crucifix on the altar reredos or the rood screen were during holy week bound round with rushes to cover them during holy week from palm sunday until easter day all statues crosses crucifixes etc are traditionally covered up from view or removed and no flowers are in the church the two figures were portrayed in similar garments hence the lily white boys and wrapped in rushes they were dressed up all in green one would suppose that the one of the last line would be god but god in the middle ages was more commonly thought of as the trinity and one is one and one alone if applied to god sounds more like jewish or muslim theology than christian in its strong insistence on the divine unity media alternate titles children go where i send thee i ll sing you one oh the carol of the twelve numbers the twelve apostles the dilly song the dilly carol the counting song related works the song the ten commandments by figgy duff on the cd music after the tempest is a variant of this song that that does not include the eleventh and twelfth symbols there is also a song titled green grow the rushes on the album fables of the reconstruction by the band r e m which refers to and is partially based upon this song a filk song titled high fly the nazgul o uses the same tune but the lyrics

 id=526706 title sonic the comic nonfiltered 269 processed 268 dbindex 450270 sonic the comic known to its many readers as stc was a uk children s comic published fortnightly by fleetway editions the merged companies fleetway and london editions which progressively became integrated with its parent company egmont until it became known as egmont magazines between 1993 and 2002 it was the uk s official sega comic featuring stories about its mascot sonic the hedgehog other sega video game characters and some characters that appeared in sega s consoles format sonic the comics original price was 95 pence increasing to 1 35 by the final issue the comic generally had contained four comic strip stories each usually following different storylines and being written and drawn by different writers and artists the first was always a seven page story about sonic himself except for one issue which began with tails instead and in the earliest issues the remaining three would involve a different sega game character see list below as time rolled on sonic s influence spread and the other strips were supplanted by supporting character based stories such as tails knuckles amy chaotix and the anthology sonic s world which featured a variety of events in the stc world not covered by the main character strips aside from the comic strips for its first few years stc regularly featured content related to sega videogaming fitting in with the sonic convention of calling levels zones these sections were given such titles as the q zone which featured videogame tips and cheats the news zone and the review zone readers artwork was printed in the graphic zone and letters were featured in speedlines megadroid the mascot of the comic was a robot named megadroid comprised of parts of a sega mega drive megadroid was the persona used by the editors of sonic the comic to answer letters and provide story recaps and general magazine news much like tharg in 2000ad and in fact created by former tharg richard burton he acted as a liaison between the readers whom he called boomers and the humes who think they re in charge megadroid had a one off strip where he ran away from the stc offices to a seaside town only to return from his harrowing experience to attend to the needs of the boomers megadroid was dropped from the comic in 1998 and with him the speedlines letter page vanished speedlines returned in 2000 though was no longer a regular feature and the letters were supposedly answered by sonic himself actually editor andy diggle and later steve macmanus as part of stc s unofficial fan created revival in 2003 megadroid was brought back with a mid section now made of a nintendo gamecube sonic related stories setting and history sonic the comic began its run with a series of fairly inconsequential one shot stories and only established its identity and ongoing storyline and setting with issue 8 s the origin of sonic the comic adopted a version of the kintobor origin of sonic and doctor robotnik which had originally been featured in a promotional comic for the first sonic game printed in disney adventures and had been elaborated upon in mike pattenden s book stay sonic like other uk sonic publications stc used the stay sonic version as its basis this origin story established that sonic was originally a normal brown hedgehog who burrowed his way into the underground laboratory of dr ovi kintobor a scientist who wished to rid the planet mobius of all evil through the use of powerful gems called the chaos emeralds in addition he helped sonic increase his running speed using a special treadmill until the hedgehog eventually broke the sound barrier with a sonic boom which turned him blue however an accident involving the unstable chaos emeralds and a rotten egg transformed kintobor into the evil dr ivo robotnik leading to the events of the games sonic the hedgehog and sonic the hedgehog 2 the accident consisted of kintobor accidentally knocking over a bottle of lemonade into a machine he was working on that had the emeralds inside while holding the egg while he was explaning to sonic what he was doing the origin of sonic led into a storyline in which sonic tails and their friends were sent forward in time six months during their absence doctor robotnik had successfully conquered the entire planet of mobius and sonic and co were forced underground operating as freedom fighters attempting to bring down robotnik s rule of the planet this situation remained until issue 100 1997 when robotnik was deposed the main strip of stc was always sonic s own chronicling the adventures he had both on his own and with his teammates while the other three strips in the comic were a rotating series of stories based on popular sega video games usually six parts in length as time went on these strips dwindled and were phased out entirely in favour of other stories about sonic and his friends and ememies the first of which was a tails solo series which saw him return to his home in the nameless zone where it was believed that he was the great hero of mobius not sonic leading to misadventures there in addition to tails and sonic other members of the freedom fighters included johnny lightfoot and porker lewis characters based upon the generic pig and rabbit sprites freed from badniks in the video games the team soon added the kintobor computer to their ranks an artificial intelligence based on the brain patterns of doctor robotnik s former self and were later joined by amy rose a female hedgehog infatuated with sonic whose lies about being his girlfriend had made her a target for robotnik s forces robotnik himself was later redesigned to match the appearance of his adventures of sonic the hedgehog animated series counterpart and he gained a close ally in grimer his green skinned chief scientist who was instrumental in creating metallix the metal sonic leading to the first major multi part story in the comic the sonic terminator itself an adaptation of the sonic cd video game while the sonic terminator was stc s first adaptation of a video game it was not their last knuckles the echidna and his floating island soon made their debuts in the pages of the comic as sonic the hedgehog 3 was adapted and the mysterious history of the ancient power objects the chaos emeralds and their relation to knuckles s lost race of echidnas steadily began to unfold see the gems own article for full details instantly popular with readers knuckles was spun off into his own storylines in the comic while new original characters like sky pirate captain plunder rebellious super badnik shortfuse the cybernik and engineering genius tekno the canary were introduced often in the anthology strip sonic s world and would in turn become popular enough that they would headline their own strips at times one of the most far reaching storylines of the comic was the adaptation of the sonic and knuckles game which ultimately led into the introduction of the chaotix crew and the brotherhood of metallix an army of metal sonics who had turned on robotnik and embarked on a plan to alter the timeline and take over mobius one of stcs more innovative choices compared to other sonic fiction was the use of sonic s chaos emerald induced powered up form super sonic as a monstrous inhibitionless alter ego the mr hyde to sonic s doctor jekyll the appearances of super sonic were few and far between in the first eighty or so issues of the comic making the character s eventual showings all the more impressive and special shortly after reappearing to combat commander brutus a badnik trooper programmed with robotnik s own brain patterns who eventually led a revolution against this creator exposure to more emerald power than ever made super sonic almost completely uncontrollable when the freedom fighters transferred the chaos energy out of sonic into the weird alternate dimension known as the special zone super sonic continued to exist as a separate entity forcing sonic to pursue him using the dimension hopping omni viewer to freeze super sonic in time sonic was left with no way to return to mobius and spent a brief period in the special zone while shortfuse joined the freedom fighters to keep them going and knuckles ended his long quest back to the floating island this ended when super sonic freed himself his escape triggering a planet wide electromagnetic pulse that the omni viewer shunted to mobius deactivating robotnik s computer systems and robots worldwide in the comic s landmark 100th issue with no technology or troops to protect him robotnik was finally deposed as mobius s ruler beginning a new stage in the storyline of sonic the comic after establishing the new state of play on mobius including the now amnesiac super sonic s befriending of magician ebony and psychic pyjamas stcs next major move was its adaptation of sonic 3d blast which would prove to be the last game adaptation for a prolonged period of time although it ultimately amounted to little more than use of the different elements from the game flickies island the birds used for badniks and dimensional travel via mobius rings with the added introduction of a new metallix villain with its design based on knuckles this time it was a key stepping stone in shaping the direction of sonic stories right up until the conclusion of the series the story introduced the interdimensional alien race known as the drakon empire spun out of a dangling plot point from nearly one hundred issues prior who allied themselves with doctor robotnik in an attempt to acquire the chaos emeralds revealing their previous ownership of the gems ages prior alliances betrayals and double crosses cumulated in robotnik s successful capture of the emeralds and a 4 issue epic in which he had god like powers reshaped mobius entirely but when his body was drained of chaos energy he vanished into a sub atomic dimension a series of dimension hopping adventures by amy and tekno resulted in mobius being briefly invaded by earth military forces after which sonic pursued grimer and nack the weasel in their quest to recover robotnik trapped on the sub atomic world of shanazar sonic found it hard to adapt to the local culture and when amy s adventures led her to join him on the planet the two explored the world s numerous vastly different zones combating myriad threats robotnik had his own plans however using the dimensional technology that brought sonic grimer and nack to shanazar to enlarge the world fusing it with mobius in a crisis on infinite earths style event shanazar s zones could now be accessed from portals on mobius and various doorways had also opened to various points in earth s history infuriated with yet another failure however robotnik decided to bring his long war with sonic to an end by destroying mobius once and for all entering into a partnership with the living plastic alien hive mind the plax robotnik used their technology to absorb elemental energy from both mobius and earth forcing both worlds into total ecological collapse his scheme was again foiled however by shortfuse who wired his armour into robotnik s machine undo the damage and draining the energy from the villain with the added bonus of the feedback finally liberating him from his armour this proved to be one defeat too many for robotnik retreating physically and mentally he languished in darkness until grimer desperate to snap his master out of his depression initiated the events of the comic s final storyline the adaptation of sonic adventure although in practice this would prove to be the loosest game adaptation yet as the game s wildly different approach was largely incompatible with the stc universe discovering a canister containing a creature of living chaos energy grimer unleashed the fear inducing chaos upon the freedom fighters leading to the death of johnny lightfoot rampaging out of grimer s control chaos then attacked the floating island intended to absorb the chaos emeralds but knuckles jettisoned the emeralds before he could absorb more than one causing the island itself to plunge into the ocean while robotnik then set about gathering the emeralds to lure all the players to his fortress that they might all die together sonic was transported into the ancient past of mobius by tikal and pochacamac two of the planet s race of echidnas where he witnessed the beginning of the war between the echidnas ans the drakon empire the origins of the chaos emeralds and the creation of chaos who proved to be a drakon prosecutor mutated by exposure to the emeralds returning to the present sonic arrived just as chaos absorbed the remaining emeralds and became perfect chaos robotnik s suicide plan was thwarted however by the unexpected appearance of super sonic dying due to depletion of his own chaos energy absorbing chaos s energy reverting him back to his drakon form super sonic became his old evil self again and turned on the freedom fighters until ebony used her magics to fused sonic and super sonic back together again sonic the comics original stories came to an end at this point with issue 184 but the comic continued until 223 with reprinted material from throughout the magazine s life characters sonic the hedgehog as the central protagonist and main character of the comic sonic was portrayed in his eponymous comic with an attitude which differs slightly compared to what is considered the norm in other media here he is presented as being somewhat bossy cocky and arrogant and characters regularly referred to his strange sense of humour sonic s attitude frequently made cruel jokes at the expense of his friend tails behavior contrary to that seen in most of the continuities however like all his incarnations sonic truly does care about his friends and their well being the same care also applies to his home planet of mobius towards the end of the comic s run with the death of johnny lightfoot sonic imposed a heavy blame upon himself disgusted in how he d kept his friends in the firing line for so many years after a brief self imposed exile he returned to his friends with a much less self centred attitude and now more determined than ever originally a resident of the emerald hill zone sonic became friends with the benevolent scientist dr ovi kintobor and assisted in his experiments by running errands for him he was present for most of the doctor s pivotal experiments but didn t really pay much attention to them sonic s life took a bizarre turn when kintobor directed his curiosity towards sonic s running prowess sonic was fast even before gaining his blue hue and attempted to measure what speed sonic could reach under his own power kintobor gave him friction reducing trainers or power sneakers to help him run faster and put him in a kinetic gyratosphere a spherical treadmill of sorts to test sonic s speed the machine was started up and sonic ran faster and faster in it until he reached the speed of sound causing a sonic boom that blew up the machine with the colossal quantities of kinetic energy fusing sonic s quills together and turning them a distinctly different blue colour upon kintobor s transformation into dr robotnik sonic used his speed to battle against the madman s attempts at conquering mobius sonic honed his skills using the various structures around the emerald hill zone and soon learned to control his super speed allowing him to perform aerial feats and stunts his signature move quickly became the sonic spin attack which proved useful for destroying badniks and troopers but he also employed many other techniques such as creating a cocoon of speed to rip his opponents apart over the years he was frequently able to escape being held captive by discreetly vibrating the restraints with constant speed eventually shaking them apart he also displayed the ability to create a force field by vibrating the molecules in the air around him at supersonic speed he has a cover identity of bob beaky a heavily wrapped up bird where he uses for undercover work heroes tails knuckles the echidna amy rose johnny lightfoot porker lewis shortfuse the cybernik tekno the canary chaotix the omni viewer villains doctor robotnik grimer super sonic doctor zachary commander brutus the drakon empire

adverts for the sega mega drive and mega cd while the megadroid strips were based on the host robot of sonic the comic decap attack decap attack was an adaptation of a mega drive game the strip became very popular and outlasted all the other non sonic strips partly because the editor liked it becoming nigel kitching s pet project staff the bulk of the work in the comic was written by either nigel kitching or lew stringer while art was provided by richard elson nigel dobbyn carl flint woodrow phoenix roberto corona mike mcmahon kitching himself and many others several of the comic s writers and artists have since had success elsewhere mark millar who wrote the first streets of rage storyline and some sonic strips has since written major titles for dc and marvel comics such as the authority and ultimate x men occasional cover contributor dermot power has worked as a concept artist on several hollywood films and road to perdition illustrator richard rayner contributed to decap attack scripts demise the demise of stc began when budget cuts at the comic led to the number of pages being cut from 36 to 32 in 1997 and as a result the loss of the news game review and game tips sections despite being one of fleetway s biggest selling comics in 1998 at one point that year it was outselling 2000ad from issue 133 published that july one strip an issue was given over to reprints to save money as part of fleetway s policy of five year reader cycles issue 133 was published shortly after the comic s 5th birthday later in the year the mascot megadroid was removed along with the speedlines letters page two more strips were later replaced by reprints leaving just the main strip and the cover as the only new material from issue 157 issues 155 and 156 had 2 new stories though this was merely to let the existing amy and tekno story draw to a close with only one new strip an issue this meant there were no new supporting character strips the main strip being the only new material in the comic the reprints policy meant kitching was supposed to share the main strip with lew stringer causing the plans for the shanazar arc to be heavily altered during this time the main strip s stories came under the time zone banner mostly being set on shanazar and then later involving dimensional portals leading to other dimensions earth s history identical to the previous amy tekno stories due to editorial preference this was highly unpopular with many fans as neither mobius nor any of the main characters bar sonic amy featured and the lack of anciliary strips meant no other stories could be told with richard elson s artwork also arguably at its lowest point lew stringer was the comic s sole writer during this period nigel kitching having being sacked after issue 157 returning with issue 175 after a change in editor despite an apocalyptic final story by stringer and a much lauded comeback by kitching in 2000 egmont made the decision for the comic to be fully reprint from issue 185 although these still had new covers drawn by richard elson who was the sole artist in the final issues this happened at short notice even kitching wasn t aware that issue 184 would be his last until he requested an extension for the ten issue storyline he was in the middle of writing having apparently already made plans for future stories that would follow it he revealed the cancellation to fans on the stc mailing list on april 19 2000 a little over two months before the last issue was published and only a few weeks after he himself had been made aware of the fact as a result the final story ended with a handful of loose ends from earlier stories left untied fully reprint issues continued to be published until issue 223 which reprinted the four part storyline the evil empire and featured an article by nigel kitching about his time working on the comic an abridged version of that had appeared on the mailing list related publications in addition to sonic the comic nine issues of sonic the poster mag were published this comic consisted of an a1 sized poster on the reverse of which was printed a comic strip in a4 sized sections the poster was folded to

sonic the comic online or stc o as it is commonly referred to is an unofficial web based continuation of sonic the comic the strips continue the adventures of sonic the hedgehog and his group of freedom fighters from where nigel kitching s chaos arc left off back in issue 184 stc o s first issue starts at 224 because the original stc started fully reprinting old strips from 185 to 223 meaning there is a huge gap in these issues with no new material other than the covers many notable events have taken place thus far in the online comic the long missing dr zachary was established as the primary villain for the opening issues of the comic freeing the mysterious echidna known as vichama waking shadow the hedgehog and ordering the latter to destroy the special zone tikal the echidna also returned and has lost her memories of the ancient echidna race much to knuckles regret and currently resides on the floating island the destruction of the special zone has also had seemingly further reaching reprecussions in the introduction of the family a group of mafia style insects led by the mysterious don long legs who appear to have designs on both the freedom fighters and mobius itself the comic does not have the backing of either egmont fleetway or sega but many of the original stc writers and artists have praised the website and backed its continuation nigel kitching is also an occasional contributor to the site s message boards thus it is considered among stc fans as unofficially official the closest to an official continuation there is ever likely to be it was even in the running for the diamond national comics award for best online strip 2004 coming in second place to the officially licensed matrix comics thus far the series has reached its 240th issue via this continuation and has introduced the popular game characters shadow the hedgehog and rouge the bat and even in issue 240 the older one time character bean the dynamite stc o is also home to the message

 id=7948488 title gun myths in popular culture nonfiltered 278 processed 277 dbindex 450279 throughout the years movies and television have taken liberties with reality in the interest of good visuals and larger than life characters the effects of these special effects and the tendency for humans to believe what they see have created a multitude of myths regarding firearms these range from how firearms operate to their effects down range some of these myths may be dangerous if imitated operation hammerless pistols like the glock may be cocked as they are drawn since john browning included a concealed hammer on the m1903 colt hammerless exposed hammers are not a necessity these pistols cannot be cocked or recocked without manually operating the slide a bolt action rifle fires semi automatic such as in anaconda film bolt action rifles except for a very unusual double barreled repeater costing 50 000 usd can not fire more than one shot without the bolt being manipulated to extract the empty casing cock the action and load a new round into the chamber even the fuchs repeater has only a single extra round before needing to be manually cycled silencers may be used on revolvers almost all revolvers contain a gap between the cylinder and the barrel explosive energy and noise escape through this gap when the round is fired there are few exceptions the nagant m1895 revolver a late 19th century russian service revolver can and has been silenced because the cylinder is cammed forward during the firing process to create a gas seal customized revolvers using rounds that encapsulate the propellant and a muzzle mounted suppressor have also been created for extremely specialized situations machine guns such as the heavy m60 can be accurately fired from the hip with one hand as the other arm guides the ammunition belt such as in the rambo movies these weapons fire full power rifle ammunition with full power recoil the recoil tends to force the gun away from any point of aim unless tightly controlled this results in extremely poor accuracy unless firing distances are very short pistols can be fired sideways accurately as seen on many gangsta films and videos this will result in poor accuracy and is not used by experienced shooters under normal circumstances ironically some experimental evaluations have found that holding a pistol at a 45 angle may be as accurate and allow quicker aimed follow up shots than a pistol held vertically this technique was used with the late 80s early 90s berettas because the shooter could catch hot brass in the eye if held normally it was then adopted by the gangsta lifestyle sideways firing was also used in drive by shootings because it required a minimal window gap and therefore reduced the chance that casings would fall outside of the car the m1 garand cannot be reloaded mid clip this is especially true in many video games including but not limited to day of defeat source call of duty and medal of honor in actuality you can remove the previous magazine by pulling the bolt back extracting the previously loaded cartridge and inevitably drop the extracted round pressing down the magazine catch which actually isn t pressed downwards but from left side towards right and removing the clip then inserting a new clip note that when removing a partially emptied clip you are very likely to drop the remaining cartridges on the floor as the cartridges are held in place in the clip only when full this is not a quick process and the process is quite likely to result in one ending up with a thumb painfully caught in the lock but it is definitely possible to reload magazines can be refilled when half full many video games allow the player to refill the amount of ammunition in a weapon s magazine using the same motion one would use to load a new magazine in reality one would have to either discard the partially loaded magazine and the ammunition along with it or be left with a half empty magazine in order to refill magazines one would either consolidate multiple half empty magazines into a smaller number of full ones by transferring ammunition between magazines or load loose rounds into the magazine s both are time consuming processes a semi automatic handgun can be unloaded by removing the magazine some handguns may have a magazine safety that prevents the gun from firing when the magazine is removed but most do not you must remove the magazine clear the chamber and preferably lock back the slide to check both by touch and sight to ensure a gun is unloaded even when the gun is completely without ammunition negligence is considered very rude undisciplined and embarrassing and usually considered threatening gun safety is important because most non intentional gun firing incidents involving personal injury and or property destruction also involve negligent gun handling non intentional discharges are referred to as negligent discharges as true accidents are extremely rare glocks can be fired underwater as claimed in u s marshals the average glock is extremely dangerous to fire underwater as the striker is slowed by the pressure of water and thus can simply fail to fire or when using higher pressure loads such as 40 s w or 357sig or hollowpoint rounds pressure can increase beyond acceptable limits and cause the gun to explode only the rare glock 17 mariner variant or a glock 17 fitted with special maritime spring cups and using standard pressure ball ammunition allows safe firing underwater even then the range and power is very limited with penetration of inch thick pine at 10 feet considered a good point the sound amplification effect of water is also worthy of consideration meaning that if the shooter s head is underwater the shot will be many times louder than normal and hence likely to damage hearing permanently fully automatic fire there are many myths about fully automatic firearms from the effects to the usage and purpose in reality world militaries and police forces discourage full automatic fire because of its tendency to waste ammunition while achieving very few hits and potentially overheating the weapon even going so far as to strip the full auto option on military weapons as in the latest incarnations of the american m16 instead the fully automatic mode on rifle and machine guns is most often used for suppressive fire utilizing short bursts to prevent an enemy from advancing or accurately returning fire submachine guns are a different case in that they are used primarily for short range close quarters engagements where their high rate of fire and low recoil make them much more controllable on fully automatic fire than weapons chambered for full power rifle cartridges even so submachine gun tactics also employ short bursts on a general area of the target to overcome their low power and ensure at least several hits a combatant firing any weapon on fully automatic for the entirety of the magazine s capacity will likely miss with the majority of their shots and inflict a large amount of collateral damage unless the target is extremely close and the shooter has good control of the weapon in short many films and video games have distorted public perception of what automatic fire can do and what it was designed for ammunition use and effects bullets can be stopped by items such as car doors windshields which can deflect depending on the angle fired and range along with what caliber chairs bath tubs etc most will be penetrated quite easily with common pistol and rifle rounds some deviation in flight path while penetrating glass is a common typical household interior walls present very little obstacle to even small caliber handgun rounds however light 223 remington hollow point bullets have been shown to stop after penetrating a single interior wall by comparison the 7 62mm nato specification rounds used by the north hollywood bank robbers were shown to have penetrated an exterior wall and multiple interior walls 40mm grenades can be detonated at close ranges in actuality they have a pre set distance before becoming armed in most current rounds to avoid detonating while the shooter is still in the casualty radius one specific subtype of fuse will arm itself after 3 5m but these are not common and endanger the firer in close quarters entire rounds casing and bullet included exit the barrel such as in major payne the title character offers a 22 lr round to his date saying he pulled it out of his heart when a man shot him the round is clearly intact and is not the typical bullet used by most militaries the simpsons tend to also show this quite often throughout the series the casing is used to carry the propellant and bullet into the weapon once it is detonated the bullet leaves the casing via the barrel and the casing is ejected when the weapon is cycled via the ejection port black talon rounds will tear through body armor and are cop killer bullets seen on law order svu winchester s black talon jhp rounds have no special capability against body armor as a matter of fact they are designed to rapidly expand on impact decreasing their ability to penetrate bullet resistant armor the national institute of justice who sets standards for law enforcement body armor specifically employs full metal jacketed fmj bullets in testing as they tend to outpenetrate hollow points in most calibers hollow point rounds making massive exit wounds it is true that they expand but definitely not to the degree usually depicted a person being shot is sent flying this would be impossible since it would send the shooter flying from the recoil as stated in newton s laws of motion every motion has an equal and opposite reaction it has been documented using various techniques that even the huge 50 browning machine gun round does not have sufficient energy to knock a person backwards mathematically feasible it is impossible for a bullet and a human body to collide inelastically and in a manner that transfers the bullets energy to the body completely above a certain point the bullet transfers only part of its energy and exits the body with the rest it should be noted however that muscular reactions exist which cause the body to jerk away from a chest injury while such reactions will not cause the body to go flying they may under some circumstances cause some backward movement all bullets having almost the same level of stopping power as seen in the death wish series handgun rounds can be divided into various performance classes and performance within those classes are roughly similar however the difference between a pocket gun caliber such as the 25 acp and a magnum handgun caliber such as the 44 magnum is pronounced still even relatively powerful handguns depend on careful bullet placement for immediate results in a self defense situation dum dum rounds have a greater stopping power in general expanding rounds tend to be more effective than rounds that do not expand modern jhp self defense ammunition is carefully tailored to provide a good balance between penetration and expansion based on studies by various law enforcement organizations 5 56mm rounds are buzz saw bullets that tear through a person before tumbling inside them most high velocity rifle once slowed by impacting human tissue begin to yaw and tumble expending their energy creating a large internal wound depending on the location of the impact and the velocity of the bullet and bullet design this yawing may not occur in all wounds accuracy is not generally impacted common myths on common guns glock pistols will not be detected by metal detectors this myth was publicized in the movie die hard ii when john mcclane made a comment about the nonexistant glock 7 this is corrected in the movie lord of war when yuri sells a drug lord a glock and mentions that this is not true and not to attempt it glock handguns use steel slides and barrels and though the frame largely consists of synthetic material it does have molded in metal guide rails which would be impossible to remove without destroying the firearm this means that none of the glock s vital parts could pass through a metal detector undetected though the one in the movie is supposed to be entirely plastic s w model 29 44 magnum is the most powerful handgun in the world as mentioned in dirty harry the 44 magnum is not a handgun but rather a cartridge it was the most powerful in the world until 1959 in which it was superseded by the 454 casull the 500 s w is the current holder of the most powerful commercially manufactured handgun cartridge title m16 s are notoriously unreliable this was true for the m 16 issued during vietnam due to a variety of reasons cleaning kits were not issued due to the erroneous advertising that the weapon was self cleaning in addition the military changed the type of powder used over the objections of the designer this resulted in more fouling than anticipated while not as reliable as many other military rifles most problems have been remedied and m16s are generally reliable if kept clean and maintained properly the m16a4 is now the standard issue and older models of the m16 are being phased out bullet proof vests render a person invulnerable to most rounds there is no such thing as a completely bullet proof vest however there is body armor that offers protection against pistol and shotgun rounds to a degree rifle rounds punch through normal body armor except for armor plates designed for rifle rounds it should be noted that multiple shots can ensure penetrating and there is still the case of severe bruising or broken bones with armor barrett 50 bmg sniper rifles can be used by terrorists to shoot down commercial jets although 50 bmg weapons are very powerful compared to other small arms the cartridge s power is not adequate to cripple a large airplane by sheer impact alone most major air forces stopped using 50 caliber machine guns in their fighter aircraft shortly after world war ii for this reason furthermore all modern jet airliners have two or more engines two pilots and emergency backups for all vital systems shooting down an airliner with a 50 bmg weapon would require at least two and probably more hits to vital aircraft parts or the flight crew a highly unlikely proposition hitting a stationary target once at 1 000 yard range if one was to hypothetically ignore the altitude of most aircraft is difficult enough one could possibly hit a plane landing or taking off but that in itself would be a great challenge also the cost of the rifle and the ammunition alone would deter anyone but the most well funded group rpgs are less expensive and better suited for such purposes this rifle and round is used mostly for anti materiel purposes in the military and long distance target shooting and big game hunting notably bear in the civilian market references endofarticle doc

achieved minor regional success in film television music and radio as mike sortino before beginning a gender transition in the late 1980s brennan s first media exposure came as early as 1977 when she was a regular guest on phoenix s karz 960 radio s let s talk program hosted by bob reidy as the self appointed official representative from constitution school she generally provided wide ranging often unsolicited little professor commentary to the amusement of the host and listeners later brennan became a locally recognized figure thanks to comical self promotion stunts and prodigious work in stage film television music and writing since the mid 1990s she has primarily devoted herself to work as a writer but periodically returns to acting music and filmmaking brennan is the daughter of noted session and touring musician ron dobbins and the great granddaughter of ida mae bell owen a legendary seamstress who designed racing silks used in thoroughbred horse racing owen her husband bryan wald owen and daughter parthenia were accomplished musicians who toured the midwest in the 1930s and 1940s bryan wald owen and his sister mabel owen were popular vaudevillians in the early 1900s film television and theatre work during high school and college brennan directed and starred in several short films including the mike and eric movie spam animals and the man called bear hero at large a sporadic theatre film and television acting career soon followed including appearances in local commercials independent features and bit parts in national productions such as midnight caller the doors northern exposure and perhaps somewhat ironically the 1985 feature just one of the guys brennan began writing plays in high school and several of her surreal one act plays were produced in high school college and community theatre productions during the 1990s challenged by the personal and societal difficulties inherent in gender transition she made limited acting appearances and while she remained a prolific writer only a small portion of that material has been published or performed in 2000 brennan resumed film work in earnest directing grandma shoots grandma scores starring 99 year

 id=7458857 title list of fighting styles in fist of the north star nonfiltered 312 processed 311 dbindex 450314 the following is a list of fictional fighting styles in fist of the north star hokuto shinken north star god fist the 1800 year old chinese martial arts style used by kenshiro and his brothers hokuto shinken attacks the human body from within accomplished by striking or grasping various areas and driving one s energy inside this will usually result in almost instant death cause the opponent to become crippled or occasionally rob the victim of their own physical control the technique also increases the practitioner s strength tremendously and can allow them to perform miraculous feats of healing unlike nanto seiken it can only have one successor at a given time usually it is passed down from father to son or some other blood relative it was passed on to ramon kasumi aka ryuken after kenshiro kasumi was presumably killed see fist of the blue sky anyone else schooled in hokuto shinken not selected as successor must vow to give up the art or be forced to either have their fists destroyed or their memory removed ryuken had a series of students who grew up as if they were brothers the ones shown in the manga are kenshiro jagi toki raoh and kim kim was eliminated from the rite of succession early on and was kicked out of the dojo toki was eliminated much later due to his nuclear accident which brought on a terminal illness jagi was presumably eliminated due to his underhandedness and clear lack of ability compared to his other brothers finally raoh and kenshiro were put to a test where they were both confronted by a wild tiger and had to prove their merit as an assassin kenshiro was able to cause the tiger to submit quietly to death whereas raoh caused the tiger to fear death and attack him kenshiro was seen as having a true assassin s style and was therefore chosen as the 64th successor to hokuto shinken raoh told ryuken that he was making a mistake ryuken told ken that the tiger submiting quietly to death showed that even if raoh is the strongest ken s style is truly the fearsome terrible one after ken was chosen jagi was outraged and tried to rally his brothers to kill ken so raoh could be successor however toki supported ken and raoh did not care because he refused to give up the hokuto style anyway he believed since he was the strongest that he did not need to be named successor to conquer the world jagi decided to attack ken alone but was defeated easily by ken when jagi lunged to attack ken he slipped and ken took advantage of it to beat jagi jagi made excuses saying that if he had not slipped he could have beat ken but it was later revealed that jagi did not slip but that ken was so fast that he struck jagi s pressure points before jagi even knew what happened to stop himself from dying from ken s attacks jagi used his hokuto skills to hit his own pressure points to stop his head from exploding but it was not enough to stop permanent damage from occurring jagi remained scarred and had to wear braces on his head thereafter the four primary contenders for the hokuto shinken style all had at least a basic level of mastery of this martial arts form the anime series states that hokuto shinken is an ancient art of 2000 years and cannot be mastered by anyone without the utmost spirit and determination even jagi the least skilled of all the brothers has a fighting prowess that can put non users to shame toki not present in the animated movie was firmly embedded in the healing aspects of the powerpoints of hokuto shinken even before the nuclear war kenshiro s kind but strict nature made him the best choice to carry on the hokuto shinken style raoh s unforgiving selfish and brutally violent nature cost him the chance to succeed as the 64th successor after kenshiro defeats his one time friend shin kenshiro is made aware that someone has committed horrible atrocities in his name this person turned out to be jagi and starts off the second season of the series with kenshiro s quest to make contact with all of his brothers as the story moves along the audience gets a better picture of what kenshiro went through in his quest to be the heir to the fist of the north star toki is highly respected by kenshiro not only for his martial arts mastery but for his kind demeanor toki is characterized by his long white hair small headband and kind face a liberal interpretation of his appearance and actions can be made to say that he is a christ like figure toki tells a story from before the war when ken shin raoh and even himeslf all had feelings for yuria shin and raoh both only thought of themselves and viewed yuria as a trophy to be won toki however defended yuria against one of raoh s unwanted advances on one occasion before the nuclear war kenshiro recalls that toki was once so skilled in hokuto shinken that he would have probably become the next successor if it were not for the radiation sickness that he received when he sacrificed himself to save kenshiro and yuria toki and raoh are natural brothers and are adopted by ryuken after the death of their parents later in the manga this was retconned into the two coming from shura island with kenshiro ryuken was originally unwilling to adopt both children and cast them from a cliff telling them that the child who made it back up would be his successor to his surprise raoh scaled the cliff with one arm carrying toki with the other ryuken then adopted both children and began to instruct raoh in hokuto shinken years later after watching toki beat up a bully many times his size ryuken realized that a martial arts genius was hiding in the younger brother as well and allowed toki to come into the dojo with raoh this was the beginning of their tragedy because they both knew that they would be fated to battle for the succession toki had once promised raoh that if raoh were to turn to evil toki would stop him although toki tried to honor this promise he was devastated by his illness and unable to stop raoh raoh then freed toki from his obligation and told him to battle his illness instead raoh is a large and massive man that towers even over the large frame of kenshiro raoh has a square expressionless face and almost always wears a large helmet and rides a massive black horse raoh s single minded ambition and determination fuel his black heart with a lust for power even though raoh loses the contest for successor he none the less continues to use hokuto shinken for his own purposes while it is obvious in both the series and the movie that other characters shin rei jagi toki etc all possess enough skill to dominate the violent masses only ken and raoh seem to defeat other notable fighters with relative ease raoh is such a powerful fighter that the movie ends anti climatically when raoh actually defeats kenshiro in a one on one fight of the film s original theatrical release the aforementioned scenario did not occur in the manga nor the japanese home video release only after this confrontation does raoh seem to understand the words that ryuken mentioned to him so long ago power without perception means nothing the second half of the series continues with kenshiro s quest of defeating raoh s remaining army and building his strength to defeat and end raoh s terror during this part we learn more about raoh s past and story as a sympathetic character at volume 13 it turns out that yuria never died from her suicide attempt and she is also a nanto seiken successor as the motherly star hence ryuken once foretold that the world will be in peace when hokuto and nanto join forces when raoh knew yuria was alive he took her as a hostage and forced kenshiro into life and death combat once and for all nanto seiken south star holy fist nanto rokusei ken south star six holy fists the nanto seiken style sets generally tend to consist of styles that focus on dazzling maneuvers and using energy to pierce cut and dice enemies and objects often they focus on speed to slice the opponent and let them fall apart afterwards sometimes this will happen so fast the opponent will not even realize they re dead it can be debated that in the manga air pressure may be used to slice the opponent instead of energy nanto kosh ken nanto kosh ken south star lone eagle fist is a very direct style of nanto seiken it focuses on stabbing and thrusting attacks seemingly being most useful at a close range often the slicing will be simulated via tearing where the user will put his hand into an opponent s body usually torso and pull it to either side it is important to note than in the original manga and anime this style was simply referred as nanto seiken when it was used as shin was the first nanto fighter as well as the first major antagonist introduced in the series nanto suich ken nanto suich ken south star waterfowl fist is the most graceful of the nanto seiken styles with a focus on grace and aerial attacks its primary usage is for medium range attacks nanto k kaku ken nanto k kaku ken south star crimson crane fist is a style based on long range vertical attacks it can attack a wide vertical range and seems to cause more damage when used for vertical slices nanto hakur ken nanto hakur ken south star white heron fist is a kick based style somewhat rare in hokuto no ken whereas most nanto seiken styles primarily use the hands nanto hakur ken primarily uses the feet though it still uses the hands the user can attack a wide range around them even a spinning kick that decimates those around them nanto h ken nanto h ken south star phoenix fist is the most powerful form of nanto seiken it is a free form style without stances or forced routine the user has the ability to glide forward leading into a powerful scissor attack there can absolutely be only one successor to this style the successor must kill his teacher the ultimate technique of this style is tensh j ji h the heaven soaring cross phoenix which takes a stance with the user s arms held out evenly like a cross as the name suggests it s launched into a powerful aerial attack this is the only stance taken in nanto h ken and is only taken when a worthy opponent appears nanto goshasei south star five chariots the nanto goshasei styles revolve around the use of elements but still share much in common with the normal nanto seiken read its ability to slice the opponents however all forms of this use different techniques and attack styles to do so wind the gosha wind style is a style based on swift maneuvers aerial attacks and apparently long range attacks though it has been seen used as a shield of sorts this style uses air pressure and cutting winds to slice the opponent to pieces due to this usage of wind it can be used as a long or short range style fire the gosha fire style seems to use linear lines of heat to cut through the opponents basically burning through them if the opponent has been damaged due to the large amount of heat he will burst into flames the user if willing to sacrifice himself can well up the heat in his own body causing spontaneous combustion mountain the gosha mountain style seems to be based on crushing force pressure tearing the opponent down the middle unlike most other nanto styles it is not graceful in the least it is blunt and powerful as opposed to the fine linear slices of the other nanto styles the attack size of this style is rather large to further clarify if an opponent is sliced down the middle of his body the pressure will crush through the opponent effectively removing the middle third of the body cloud the cloud style is a free form style apparently without set stances as opposed to cutting the cloud style seems to be based on defeating the opponent in a series of long quick smooth motions ocean the ocean style doesn t see much use in the anime series noticeably the user seems to be able to increase his body size curl into a ball and send himself flying through the air destroying whatever is in his path minor nanto styles most of these are barely even worth mentioning most of them were seen only in the anime series as well filler was needed in the anime to lengthen the story especially during the first chapter according to the anime shin taught his generals some nanto powers who used their limited nanto knowledge to make their own styles nanto muon ken silent fist seems to be mainly for use with claws needles and stabbing weapons apparently just improves the speed and cutting quality of attacks nanto s zan ken paired kill fist a strange knife throwing style that requires two users facing each other with the opponent in the middle they throw the knives between each other around the opponent one user throws underhand and catches overhand the other used throws overhand and catches underhand they slowly move in barely noticeable until they are close enough to attack with the knives nanto s y ken paired hawk fist mentioned but not used all that s known is that it requires two users nanto sh ten ken ascension fist a style based on speed agility and height the user can jump extraordinarily high throw objects with stunning accuracy and speed and produce two mirage duplicates around him with which he can rotate for an illusion nanto k mori ken bat fist involves the usage of gliders and claws mainly involves diving down onto the opponent nanto bakusatsu ken explosive kill fist creative rough fist to fist art that uses explosives and jumping techniques nanto ansh ken dark bell fist a style based on use of sound waves and hypnosis the style s sound waves tend to come from bells nanto ry jin ken dragon king fist a set of styles the first one is fire boxing in which the user can safely engulf his skin in flames to destroy his opponent also in this style the user can breathe fire however if the user is incapable of breathing the fire can not escape and the fire will destroy them from the inside out the second part of this style is an illusion based style which also uses knife throwing the user apparently could use small crystal orbs to give the illusion of a dragon which would be hiding knives or flames nanto ningen h dan human cannonball closer to a move than a style it involves the user being equipped with a sword apparently katana and fired into the air via cannon the user upon getting above his target can hold their sword outwards and drop down suddenly and with great violent force this is more of a siege style than a fight style taizan ji kenp mount tai temple martial arts an ancient fighting style developed at the taishan temple in shanxi china the taizan fighters grew corrupt and eventually carried much influence over the japanese government in the 1980s before the nuclear war this may not be in continuity it directly refers to the two hokuto no ken tryouts in which the taizan fighters were the main enemies when the series proper began most of the backstory was drastically retooled in the 1990s many of the taizan fighters became part of raoh s army taizan tenr ken taishan sirius fist a freezing flesh scooping style taizan ry s j ben taishan style twin streak whip a whip wielding style taizan y ken taishan bewitch fist uses ribbons and spikes kazan saigoku ken mount hua western peak fist a few characters used

saigoku ha gins western peak sect silver spear gento k ken original dipper imperial fist the gento k ken style was created to protect the tentei heaven empress their symbol is the tentei star also known as the taikyoku sei polaris the gento k ken style focuses on use of ki energy usually projected outwards as a blast or sometimes a shield it uses ki like a blade to destroy the opponent s body on a cellular level this style gets surprisingly little use in the series save for falco of the golden style this style is based on and ranked by colors it is unclear what if any constellation that gento refers to many fans speculate it is the little dipper because it s a dipper shaped constellation that contains polaris the colors are gold the gold style is the absolute strongest generally used for varying types of blasts and projectiles noticeably it can also freeze and cut opponents purple the purple style seems to be based around rings of energy theorizing that they re unavoidable red the red style gets absolutely no use in the series one attack is seen in the anime and it seems fairly generic blue anime only style the blue style seems fairly generic as well notably the sole user of it uses a spear but it s unknown if this is universal or just a personal preference the blue and green styles were created for the anime to take the place of jakou s sons green anime only style the green style never sees any use in the series hokuto ryuu ken north star lapis lazuli fist derived alongside hokuto shinken from the original hokuto souke ruling family of shura island its first practitioner was ryuoh practitioners of hokuto shinken regard its existence as heresy while it shares many of its basic attacks with hokuto shinken its essence is deeply rooted in channeling of essence and magic the effort required to control these energies drives many of its practitioners mad with hatred the last master of the art juukei murdered his own family and attempted to kill ryuken who was able to restore him to sanity later juukei sent kenshiro raoh and toki to ryuken believing that raoh would succeed ryuuken as the hokuto shinken successor and free his motherland of shura from the evil of hokuto ryuu ken later unable to wait for raoh he trained kaioh raoh s older brother han and hyoh kenshiro s natural brother in hokuto ryuuken to his dismay rather than fight against the evil of shura they joined in it he later joined a resistance movement against the shura reluctantly teaching shachi hokuto ryuu ken to help him fight against the shura soldiers when kenshiro followed lin juukei was distraught that it was not raoh who had succeeded ryuuken in hokuto shin ken after han was killed juukei believing that kenshiro could not raise his hand against his own brother sought out hyoh in combat he had erased hyoh s memories of kenshiro years before so he could focus on the fight attempting to undo this erasure he discovered that kaioh had modified his memories and was slain by hyoh although hyoh was eventually able to regain his memory he was defeated by kaioh unable to stop kaioh s fall to evil kaioh later became himself again and destroyed himself with molten lava after being defeated by kenshiro bringing hokuto ryuu ken to its end towards the end of the manga the true relationship between hokuto shinken and hokuto ryuuken is brought to light the hokuto souke practitioners of hokuto ryuuken ruled shura island during the time of the gento empire s fall several thousand years ago to ensure that they could bring peace in the violent times the rulers of the family decided that next son of the line would be their successor and invent the world s deadliest fist the two princesses of the hokuto line gave birth on the same day to two sons shuken and ryuuoh to prevent division among the family it was decided that one of the infants would die ohka the eldest of the sisters gave her life to protect both children when she discovered that her sister shume was ill and would not survive to see her son grow up shume s son shuken never forgot the love his mothers showed him becoming the successor he developed hokuto shinken ryuuoh threw away love and mastered the family art of hokuto ryuuken kenshiro and hyoh are descended from shuken kaio raoh toki and sayaka are descended from ryuuoh due to his lineage hyoh had knowledge of the original hokuto the precursor to ryuuoh s refined hokuto ryuuken he refused to use this style believing that it was for kenshiro only he is later able to pass on this knowledge to ken and kenshiro discovers the truth behind the two styles hokuto ryuuken is ultimately a passive style based on distorting the enemy with evil ki and it cannot stand against hokuto shinken which was designed to be used in an active role ultimately however the deciding factor between kenshiro and kaio is kenshiro s compassion kaio thinking only of himself does not understand death and cannot carry the spirits of others on inside him the way kenshiro can driving him to fight thus the differences between the two reflect the differences between their ancestors hokumon no ken fist of the north gate an inferior offshoot of hokuto shin ken started by a former hokuto shin ken student that failed to be successor seiji from shin hokuto no ken new fist of the north star used this style unlike its origin art hokumon no ken is designed for healing not for the purpose of assassination this became even more apparent when seiji s techniques failed to have any effect on kenshiro however it is still very effective in killing those who are

 id=7431818 title electrical electronic telecommunications and plumbing union nonfiltered 318 processed 317 dbindex 450320 the electrical electronic telecommunications and plumbing union known as the eeptu was a british trade union formed in 1968 it was a union for electricians it often found itself in unpopular positions with the trade union movement as it chose to work harmoniously with employers rather than in defiance history the union started as the electrical trades union etu which was formed in 1889 and what became the plumbing trades union which was formed in 1865 the etu came from the merger of the union of electrical operatives formed 1868 and the amalgamated society of telegraph and telephone construction men the ptu started out as the united operative plumbers association of great britain and ireland which became the united operative plumbers and domestic engineers association of great britain and ireland in 1911 then the plumbers glaziers and domestic engineers union in 1931 before becoming the ptu in 1946 in june 1961 the etu was taken to court for conspiracy to defraud by the undemocratic union leadership jock byrne took over leadership which is when the right wing ideology of the union gained ground jock byrne suffered a stroke which led in 1966 frank chapple august 8th 1921 october 19th 2004 to become the leader he espoused free market thinking which was unusual for a union leader and aimed to rid his union of communists his former union the etu had been run by communists in some ways he was a man ahead of his time the era of new labour he was a reluctant loyalist to the labour party this was just the beginning the union went on to advocate nuclear power privatisation of state owned industries and membership of the european union it also co operated in single union deals with companies to the smooth the path of employers and as a result benefitting their union possibly or deliberately at the expense of other unions in july 1968 the etu merged with the ptu to form the electrical electronic telecommunications union plumbing trades union which became the electrical electronic telecommunications plumbing union in 1973 in the early 1970s electricity was in steep demand as there were many national power cuts caused by coal miners going on strike in september 1982 frank chapple became leader of the tuc eric hammond became leader when frank left in 1984 frank chapple became lord chapple of hoxton in 1985 eric hammond was not liked by many unions as he tried to modernise working practices wapping dispute the history of the eeptu would not be complete without this notorious chapter in this dispute in january 1986 rupert murdoch and the editor of the sunday times andrew neil had to find a strategy to implement new computer technology and printing equipment without the whole scheme being blocked by the trades unions of the printers the national graphical association led by tony dubbins and sogat led by brenda dean workers often had to belong to a closed shop to work in printing works and there were many strikes working practices would have to be changed and huge redundancies would be unavoidable as all the labourious printing and typeface setting found in fleet street could be simplified using more reliable and less troublesome computers this barely involved printers certainly no one was needed to produce the typefaces so an alternative to asking the nga and sogat politely if they wanted to change on their terms was the only way to get the whole changeover completed the unions were given no hint or consultation of how the whole long winded process of printing was going to be unceremoniously ditched and effectively started from scratch they were relying on stopping the national union of journalists members from using the computers they were entirely duped it was a brave new world and not one that was lightly undertaken an option could be to use printers who did not belong to a union but the outcome chosen was to use workers who belonged to the eetpu they were being classed as electricians this was a loophole to avoid confrontation with the nga and sogat who were not the greatest advocates of change it was known as a sweetheart deal in november 1986 the tuc decided not to punish the eeptu for this deal expulsion from the tuc the union wrote its own rule book when it came to making deals with companies and often stuck two fingers up at the tuc it was expelled from the tuc for violating the bridlington agreement which stops unions from poaching members from other tuc unions the eetpu had developed a policy of signing single union agreements in companies where it had few members in 1987 the tuc asked the eetpu to retract from these agreements at yuasa a japanese battery company thorn emi and orion a japanese electronics company the eetpu refused and its 225 000 workers were expelled which was a relief and revenge for some more left wing unions once separate from the tuc communist sections of the union re emerged in an effort to change the policies of the union mergers the union merged with the aeu to become the amalgamated engineering and electrical union aeeu in may 1992 so the electricians were now part of the tuc the aeeu was led by ken jackson who belonged to the eetpu and was knighted in 1999 the aeeu then merged with the manufacturing science and finance msf to become amicus in 2001 amicus the largest private sector union with 1 2m workers has been led by derek simpson a left winger since june 2002 tony dubbins of the

history story set during the american civil war the story deals with a group of time travelling afrikaner weerstandsbeweging who conceal their true identities while restating their acronym as america will break members from 2014 who wish to alter the outcome of the civil war and as a result insure the success of their own cause in the future in order to do this they provide the south with a large number of ak 47s to all but a few confederate leaders who are told the truth they are known as rivington men after the fictional north carolina town where they set up their base the confederacy starting to reel towards defeat in the late winter of 1863 64 welcomes the guns and other supplies the armies of the confederacy are trained in their use and when the opposed armies break camp to fight the battle of the wilderness there is an overwhelming confederate victory rather than the inconclusive result in our timeline lee s army defeats the union again near bealeton virginia crosses the potomac and in a daring night battle captures washington dc with parallel successes by confederate troops on other fronts u s president lincoln has little choice but to sign an armistice agreeing to the withdrawal of union troops and negotiations to determine a final border during those negotiations the confederacy abandons claims to west virginia and maryland while the united states cedes the indian territory with kentucky and missouri to hold state wide referendum votes to determine which nation they will join after the completion of the negotiations voting and political conversation during which a minor incident occurs where two members of the awb are caught by union pickets attempting to smuggle ak 47s into the disputed states referenda are held where kentucky chooses to join the confederacy while missouri chooses to remain with the union general lee returns to his duties in virginia with the hope of finally settling down with his family including his ailing wife at their home arlington house for the remainder of their days such is not to be jefferson davis president of the confederacy makes clear his wish that lee be the next man to hold the position the awb whose goal from the beginning had been to maintain the confederacy as a bastion of black oppression feel that lee is too soft on the question of slavery and rally behind general nathan bedford forrest a member of the confederate cavalry in the hopes of electing him to office a slave trader himself forrest is believed to be the perfect man for the job of maintaining the standard of white supremacy the election is hotly contested both men heroes of the recent war and filled with charisma but lee emerges the victor despite the introduction of 20th and 21st century campaigning techniques by the awb to bolster forrest s one note campaign to preserve slavery in the south several of the states which voted for forrest begin to call for secession from the confederacy and the creation of their own nation echoing the original southern secession after the election of lincoln to the union s presidency however forrest feels that such an action would be nothing short of petulance and concedes defeat offering his personal service in the confederate army if any states do attempt to secede lee is presented with a stolen book from the future proving that the rivington men lied about the catastrophes which they claimed lay in wait for the south if it lost the war he confronts rhoodie the awb has no chance of influence over lee and at the presidential inauguration several of its members attempt to assassinate lee they attack now president lee armed with uzis and shielded with kevlar or a similar material vests both still a mystery to the confederacy and manage to kill a number of prominent confederates including lee s newly inaugurated vice president albert gallatin brown and general jubal early lee survives the attempt on his life by nothing more than pure luck though his wife is killed the awb forces in richmond are attacked and after a fierce battle are finally defeated their offices contain many items from the 21st century that are a mystery to the soldiers who discover them gas powered electrical generators fluorescent lighting and a macintosh computer which lee calls a qwerty for the keys but most importantly contains dozens of historical texts that reveal not only the awb s true intentions but that they had twisted the historical facts so as to present the south s defeat as far worse than it actually was all of these are contained in a secure area at the awb headquarters in richmond behind a safe like door which the confederates lack the technology to defeat but eventually outflank instead of breaking down the door they break through an outer wall of the building after the capture of the awb s richmond offices lee presents before the confederate leadership all the historical documents that the men from the future used to inform themselves of the events of the present time with the view of hindsight which is always 20 20 they see how the issue of slavery is almost universally reviled in the future and that where they had hoped to be vindicated for their actions by their descendants practically the entirety of the world viewed the civil war and southern secession to be little more than a crime against humanity itself with this new information congress is more inclined to agree to lee s plan to pass a bill for gradual emancipation of its entire slave population the bill itself was modelled after a proposed act of legislation in slave holding brazil though the real bill was not proposed until years after the setting of the novel and turtledove notes in an afterword that it is anachronistic lee orders the confederate army against the awb however the awb have managed to secure control over an area around rivington due largely to elements of their advanced technology which they have not shared with lee s men including mines mortars walkie talkies flak jackets and so called endless repeaters in reality belt fed machine guns that prevented any form of massed advance on the awb lines and they manage to successfully repel all confederate attempts to retake their territory with the awb resupplied from the future the conflict appears to be a stalemate with a newly reinstated forrest in command it is a brilliant strategy by lt colonel henry pleasants a former union officer who remained in the south after he had been captured during the war that finally allows the confederates to breach the awb perimeter the confederate forces manage to overcome the awb s superior technology through sheer numbers and determination the awb combatants are eventually defeated and those who are unable to escape in their time machine are captured rhoodie surrenders but is killed by one of his slaves in retaliation for severe mistreatment most of the rivington men kept their slaves under deplorable conditions and despite years of tradition which demand the slave be put to death even the confederate soldiers believe rhoodie deserved what he got quickly ordering the slave to flee the area the surviving awb members are held in a confederate prison under constant guard while all face a sentence of death proceedings are on indefinite stay so long as those willing to cooperate assist in bridging the gaps in the information presented in the historical texts and technological items recovered following the awb s defeat although some gaps would prove almost impossible to fill due to numerous generations of technological advancements 1870s technology would be far too immature to attempt to repair a 21st century computer at the component level for example most of the awb survivors agree to cooperate much in the same way captured german scientists cooperated with their soviet captors they can cooperate or die analysis the story is told alternately from the third person perspectives of general lee himself and of first sergeant nate caudell an actual historical figure who served in the 47th north carolina this enables the reader to witness events from both the top and the bottom on the battlefield in the early part of the book and later in the civilian life of the post war confederacy the realities of the situation gradually reveal themselves as lee learns more about his dubious allies while caudell also hears increasingly disturbing rumors about the situation at rivington with the concluding explosive confrontation with the awb again seen alternately from the two distinct viewpoints turtledove used historical records of an actual confederate army unit the 47th north carolina to flesh out his list of characters all the characters in the book are mentioned with the actual ranks they held in the 47th including mollie bean who as a woman masqueraded as a male confederate soldier for most of the war before being wounded and captured by union forces as well as their civilian employment if it is known awards the book won the john esten cooke award for southern fiction in 1993 trivia dr turtledove has an entire unrelated book series known among fans as timeline 191 on an alternate history in which the confederacy won the civil war though this time not through deus ex machina intervention by time travel instead the famous lost orders are found by other confederates the union does not learn of lee s plans and a battle equivalent to the battle of antietam results in decisive confederate victory the idea of a time traveller bringing advanced weapons to

 id=496074 title ubi nonfiltered 332 processed 331 dbindex 450334 the ubi were one of the twelve tribes which constituted croatian statehood in the middle ages they held the county of bribir varvaria in inland dalmatia today bribir is an archaeological site in inland dalmatia it is located on a flat hill about fifteen kilometres northwest of skradin nearby the old zadar road which goes through benkovac to ibenik under the steep rocks of its western side there is the source of the bribir ica stream and from here the rich and fertile bribir ostrovica field spreads out the hill of bribir an ideal place to control the surrounding territory was perfect for human habitation during all ages the one who held it had control over all roads and approaches from the sea to the hinterland and so man has dwelled here since the old stone age there was a settlement as early as the beginning of the older iron age expanding and developing during the liburnian period continuing during the roman domination and lasting to the end of the middle ages during the roman period bribir known as varvaria had the status of municipium and was the centre of one of the fourteen liburnian counties the byzantine emperor constantine porphyrogenitus writing in the x century about the croats settling in dalmatia in the vii century describes how this people had organised their country into eleven counties zupanias one of which was breberi centred on site of the old varvaria the county stretched between the zrmanja river to the w and petrovo polje to the e straddling the krka and ikola rivers a line of hills separated it from the territory of knin to the n and to the s it bordered on skradin it was held by a clan that in coeval documents is referred to as nobiles comites or principes breberienses these breberienses belonged to the ubi tribe one of the twelve which composed croatian statehood in the middle ages and one of the six from which the ban or viceroy was chosen the original arms of this clan of nobles is a wing argent on a shield gules argent and gules are the colours of the papal party guelfs and of croatia the coat of arms could be derived from the winged shield standard of the royal chamberlain a post held by budez postelnic berberensis jupanus 1069 in recent history books whenever members of this clan are mentioned in relation to their prominent role in the xiii and xiv centuries the surname of ubi is conferred upon them by the historian this was not the way however that the members called themselves at the time during the middle ages every man in croatia bore four names the name given at baptism the patronym the name of the clan which was also the name of the settlement in which it lived and the tribal affiliation in the period between 1069 to the destruction of the county by the turks in 1520 the many personages of the clan that emerge from the original latin documents qualify themselves as de breberio preceded by their christian name and patronym only rarely do they add their tribal affiliation the seal of paul pavao 1312 the greatest figure of the clan has the following lettering on it s igillum pauli breberiensis bani tocius sclavonie thus in the vulgar the surname would be breber or some variant brebir bribirski breberi brebri the xix century erudite croatian historians who wrote the first history books for the public opted for ubi which in the ardent nationalistic spirit of the time sounded reassuringly slavic as compared to breber during the reign of dmitar zvonimir 1075 1089 the mythical golden age of the kingdom of croatia the highest court offices of postelnik comes camerarius and tepizo comes palatinus are held by budez and dominicus both of the lineage during the xiii and xiv centuries brebers are many times called to cover the post of count in the townships of split trogir skradin and omi in the documents which have come down to us it is possible to identify six different branches of the breber clan the most illustrious of which is the one descended from iupanus miroslaus brebriensis filius bogdanizi 1184 his great grandson paul mentioned above reaches the peak of power towards the end of the xiii century he is ban of croatia and dalmatia his rule extends to bosnia and with his brothers he controls the maritime cities of dalmatia in these regions he is the champion of the pope and is instrumental in placing charles the firstborn of the king of naples on the throne of hungary and croatia he is related to the king of naples the king of serbia the da camino lords of treviso and the tiepolo and dandolo patricians of venice when he dies 1312 his eldest son mladen tries to keep the hold over the other croatian clans but is unsuccessful and bit by bit loses lands castles and towns in 1347 king louis i of hungary confers on this branch of the brebers in the persons of count gregory and count george respectively son and nephew of ban paul the castle of zrin in exchange of the strategically important castle of ostrovica their last holding outside of ancestral breber this branch will be thenceforth known with the surname of zrin a zrinio zrinsky zrinyi zrini de serin and will again rise to heights of fame and glory with count nicholas iv the hero of szigetvar 1566 and with count nicholas vii 1616 1664 the scourge of the ottomans marcus forstall the secretary of the latter compiled a history of the zrins tracing it back to the brebers to the tribe of ubi and from here to the roman gens sulpicia who according to suetonius sprang from the love of zeus for pasiphae a feeling for classical antiquity was a cultural feature of the renaissance and the wish to establish a link with the great tradition of rome was a common vanity of those times the claim of the zrins however is not totally groundless during the times of the roman empire dalmatia was a senatorial province and would have affiliations with the patrician families of the capital varvaria was in fact a roman municipium under italic law other clans in dalmatia like the karin the gusi and some of the patrician families from the maritime cities also claimed the same origins the greatness of the house of zrin ended with the famous trial of vienna 1671 regarding the zrinski frankopan plot of the last counts adam fell in the cavalry charge against the turks at salankemen in 1671 and antun after having brilliantly fought against the french fell in disgrace and died in prison in 1703 another branch of the clan descended from a petrus living at the beginning of the xiv century owes its rise to having remained unshakeably loyal to sigismund of luxemburg the future holy roman emperor 1411 in his struggle for the crown of hungary croatia against ladislas of durazzo nicholas james and john nobiles de breberio are confirmed in their possessions james is nominated viceban and they receive the castle of perna with all the appurtenances this family from now on known as perenyi peransky de

destined to wealth and power are the descendants of ugrinus died 1335 known under the nickname of meli then melith which later became their surname they obtained vast estates in transylvania besides these particular offshoots which went their separate ways a numerous kin continued to abide by the ancient holding of breber in 1324 when the citizenship of zadar was conferred on the nobiles domini de briberio 190 members of the clan presented themselves for the investiture in 1353 the ottoman turks crossed the dardanelles and began their invasion of europe in the xv century bosnia was already a pashalik from where raids would be carried into croatia dalmatia the feudal levies and the clan warriors had no hope against the turkish war machine and met their fate in the battle of krbavsko polje 1493 the castle of breber was caught on the front between the turkish hungarian and venetian armies and by 1520 had become a desolate waste of rubble last news giving the comites breberienses still in their ancient seat is in the diocesan synod of skradin held at the time of bishop archangel 1490 1502 the turkish terror displaced large portions of the population of dalmatia croatia some sought refuge in the cities of the coast some crossed the sea to italy others especially those belonging to the nobility resettled to the north in that part of slavonia still under the crown of hungary

by the name of sdrin sdrinia count nikola zrinski born 1508 the ban of dalmatia slavonia and croatia the commander of szeged since 1561 and the habsburg commander in western hungary since 1563 the most courageous and prominent member of the zrinski family which together with the frankopans was the most distinguished and famous noble family in the croatian history he established his reputation as a fearless warrior in the defense of vienna in 1529 and in the victory over the turks at budapest 1529 as croatian ban he persistently advocated croatian interests he acquired immortal fame for himself and croatia in the battle of szigetvár in 1566 more than 100 000 well armed turks headed by the famed suleiman the magnificent and grand vezier mehmed pasha sokolovi besieged the fortress of szeged from august 7th to september 7th 1566 zrinski with two thousand three hundred and a few more warriors defended it until the charge from the fortress in which he was killed the sultan offered nikola zrinski the crown of croatia in vain the destiny of europe was at stake then and zrinski and his company of croatian knights chose to defend the interests of the christian west sultan suleiman died during the battle so the grand vezier abandoned that military expedition and returned to constantinople the zrinski era lasted for whole 145 years the zrinskis were not only distinguished warlords famous after their heroism in fighting the turks but also poets and book lovers the zrinski family is considered to have played the most important role in the cultural history of me imurje northern part of croatia near the border of slovenia and hungary in order to understand the zrinski epoch better it is necessary to get to know the zrinski family better nikola s iv son giorgio v juraj inherited his father s property but he more interested in books than in chivalry he became enthusiastic about lutheranism which he did not accept but forced the people to turn protestant as well he persecuted catholic priests and devastated a number of the churches especially the famous paulist monastery at sveta helena which did him no credit of course but on the other hand he founded the first printing office at nedeli e near akovec in 1574 when there was no other printing office in croatia his son giorgio vi juraj jr turned back to catholicism and purified me imurje from lutheranism he was in complete succession to the famous warlord nikola sdrin he was a brave and fearless warrior famous for fighting the turks at palanka unfortunately his chivalry and rapier tonguedness were a

the comet in a van de flores is in no rush to retrieve the nemesis yet as the comet will be too hot due its descent through the atmosphere he tells his soldiers they will wait in a hotel leaving british police to guard the site unaware of the true power of the nemesis in the castle ace finds a card telling the history of the bow relating how it disappeared in 1788 and that unless a place is kept in the castle for its return the entire silver statue will return to destroy the world the doctor tells her that the statue has indeed returned with that purpose at this point the lights dim and ace thinks it is a power cut travelling back in time to 1638 the doctor and ace go to the time travelling woman s house in windsor seeing the corpse of the mathematician the doctor hurriedly covers it with a cloth so that ace does not see it the doctor sees the mathematician s calculations and is impressed that he had been able to work out when the nemesis comet will return to earth only months since the doctor s previous visit the doctor reveals that the woman lady peinforte made the nemesis statue depicting herself out of a silver metal that fell to earth in the meadow outside her house the doctor sees a chess board the game is going rather badly he tells ace that peinforte managed to travel forward in time to 1988 using the arrow and a rudimentary knowledge of time travel but mostly black magic he says that she has a nose for secrets the doctor tells ace the statue is made of a living metal validium which is capable of great destruction peinforte and her servant richard withdraw from the statue to assess the strength of the police guarding it the police are having their own problems their radios are not working the batteries are dead around the comet crash site vents emerge from the ground spewing gas causing the policemen to choke and fall unconscious the tardis materialises outside windsor castle in 1988 the doctor and ace follow a group of tourists on a guided tour seeing a no entry sign they sneak into the castle hearing the bark of dogs they see a woman coming towards them with several corgis the doctor tells ace to look like they own the place because that always works although the doctor does not recognise the woman ace immediately realises that it is the queen elizabeth ii and drags him into hiding however when she tells him who it was he races after the queen saying they need the armed forces and police on their side and what better person could they ask the doctor and ace are seized by security guards before they can get anywhere near the queen the doctor informs them that they got into the castle by travelling in time and space but they are incredulous the doctor tells them the fate of every living person is in danger but the guards do not believe him the doctor dons a pair of oversized glasses and glaring at them intones you will believe me you will let us go distracted by this spectacle the doctor and ace flee into the corridors of the castle as they run ace sees a portrait of herself hanging on a stairwell wall when she says she does not remember this happening the doctor tells her that it has not happened yet richard asks peinforte what she will do when she gains control of the nemesis and she replies that first she will exact revenge on that predictable little man she predicts that he will soon arrive and tells richard she knows the secret of the nameless doctor de flores and his nazis make their move for the nemesis comet and see the unconscious policemen he takes the bow case and places it on the comet and within the nemesis statue begins to glow the doctor and ace arrive and de flores demands they hand over the arrow the doctor reveals that the bow and arrow give the validium metal critical mass the doctor confronts de flores and asks if he has observed the advanced technology which has been used to attack the policemen and the power blackouts that have been occurring over the last few days de flores threatens to shoot ace if they do not tell him where the arrow is but at this moment a large spacecraft lands near the crash site the doors open and from within emerge a troop of cybermen the cyberleader recognises the doctor even though his appearance has changed and tells the onlookers that the cybermen had predicted his presence the nazis open fire on the cybermen but their bullets are ineffective the cybermen open fire and drive the nazis away the doctor says that this happened before but before it was the roundheads and lady peinforte peinforte shoots one of the cybermen with a bow and arrow de flores finds one of her arrows and sees that it is gold tipped peinforte and richard withdraw allowing the nazis and the cybermen to fight it out hoping to retrieve the nemesis in the aftermath in the confusion the doctor and ace manage to seize the silver bow and return to the tardis peinforte sees this and tries to shoot them but her arrow thuds into the tardis door just as it dematerialises while peinforte and richard enter the town of windsor the cybermen begins to cut the nemesis statue free of the comet the doctor and ace go back to peinforte s house in 1638 the body of the mathematician has gone and the chess pieces have also been moved the doctor tells ace that although the mathematician was a genius he had needed a little help to get started the doctor picks up a piece of paper from the desk and throws it into the fireplace making a further move on the chess board they leave materialising back in the present day the doctor explains that validium was created on ancient gallifrey by omega and rassilon as the ultimate defence some of it however left gallifrey and now they must stop peinforte or anyone else reuniting the statue the bow and the arrow using the bow to lead them they proceed in the direction of the statue in windsor peinforte and richard are confronted by two thugs asking if they are social workers the thugs demand money soon after the pair of skinheads are seen hanging tied up by their ankles in a tree whilst their cloths burn on a bonfire the doctor uses the tape deck to start transmitting a signal which interferes with the cybermen s communications as they proceed they see the pair of thugs still tied up and are surprised when they hear that social workers did this to them as richard is terrified by the sight of a bizarre creature a llama peinforte tells him that if he does not help her retrieve the nemesis she will abandon him in this future time he then sees that they are standing by a memorial statue she tells him that it is his tomb placed in the grounds of her own burial place the arrow starts glowing and they realise that that is where the cybermen have taken the nemesis statue as they scour the tomb for nemesis the cybermen prepare to attack but realising they are armed with gold arrows retreat opening up her grave they see that it does not contain her bones the doctor asks ace if she ignored his instructions and prepared any nitro 9 explosive when she denies it he tells her to blow up the cybermen s spacecraft he distracts the cyberman controlled human guards and ace throws her rucksack into the vehicle causing an explosion destroying it completely when the cybermen return they think the human guards have betrayed them and kill them de flores approaches the cybermen and starts to quote wagner comparing themselves to supermen and the cybermen to giants he strikes a deal with the cyberleader to kill peinforte and richard in exchange for a share of control of earth after its conquest the cybermen have no intention of honouring the deal and plan to kill the nazis after the death of peinforte the doctor tells ace that every time the nemesis comet approached earth in its 25 year orbit it caused destruction in 1913 the eve of the first world war 1938 hitler annexes austria 1963 kennedy assassinated and now it is 1988 they use the tape deck scanner trying to find the cyber fleet opening up the grave fully peinforte gazes upon her own image shown on the nemesis statue however de flores and his man arrives with guns and richard has only one arrow left in fear he hands over the arrow to de flores and drags peinforte away leaving the nazis in control of nemesis de flores believes he now has all three parts of the validium placing the arrow in the statues hands it becomes more animated the cybermen arrive and ask de flores where the bow is when he opens the case he sees that he does not have it at all the doctor sees a chameleon and realises the cyber fleet is shrouded and making the adjustment to the tape deck reveals the entire fleet of cyber warships thousands of them the doctor decides to activate the validium by taking the bow to the crypt when ace seems frightened the doctor tells her she can wait in the tardis but she refuses and wants to accompany the doctor meanwhile de flores realises he has overplayed his hand and tries to negotiate with the cyberleader the cyberleader orders his lieutenant to kill de flores but he throws gold dust in the leader s face and flees the other nazi however turns on de flores and offers him to the cybermen asking to be made into a cyberman himself the two nazis are then taken to be prepared for cyber conversion as the doctor and ace arrive at the crypt the jazz tape finishes playing and the cybermen s communications begin working the doctor enters the crypt holding the bow and manoeuvring past the cybermen with ace places the bow in the statue s hands but snatches it away again the statue awakens and begins to follow the bow going back to 1638 the doctor continues his chess game against his unknown opponent ace asks him who brought the validium to earth in the first place and what is really going on but he remains silent taking a bag of gold coins they leave peinforte begins to rant about all power being hers and her intent to retrieve the nemesis they come to the road and attempt to hitch a lift in a passing car richard stands with his thumb out but no cars stops for them seeing this fail peinforte steps into the middle of the road a large car stops and an american woman offers to take them into windsor she tells them that she is in england discovering her roots revealing she is descended from the 17th century remington family peinforte calls them thieves and swindlers mentioning a dorothea remington the american woman recognises the name and peinforte knows that dorothea died in 1621 from a slow poison with the cybermen set off after the nemesis and the doctor de flores is released from his bonds by his man who had deceived the cybermen into thinking he had betrayed the nazi leader meanwhile the doctor and ace materialise inside the hangar containing the comet soon the nemesis statue arrives and the doctor gives it the bow the nemesis speaks to ace telling her that it was fashioned by peinforte into its current beautiful form but that it has also had horrific forms in the past and will again in the future the cybermen arrive and ace shoots one down using a gold coin and a sling shot the cybermen pursue her but she manages to elude them the doctor sets the trajectory of the rocket sled containing the nemesis headed for the cyber fleet ace becomes trapped on a gantry between two cybermen and the cyberleader with only a single remaining gold coin the cybermen lift their guns to shoot her but she fires the gold coin at the cyberleader and ducks causing the other two cybermen to shoot each other instead the nemesis asks the doctor if she must destroy the entire cyber fleet to which he says that she must she asks the doctor whether she will be needed again or whether she will have her freedom but the doctor hushes her ace arrives down from the gantry but is surrounded by two more cybermen they demand that the doctor hands the bow over to them but the doctor threatens to destroy the bow if they harm her placing it in front of the rocket sled engines he grabs ace as the two cybermen advance towards them the engines fire killing the two cybermen however up on the gantry the cyberleader plucks the gold coin from its chest unit de flores arrives and picks up the bow he speaks to the nemesis but she remains silent the cyberleader raises his gun and shoots de flores dead and demands that the doctor hands over the bow at this point peinforte and richard arrive demanding the bow for herself she asks ace who the doctor is and whether she knows where he came from ace says that nobody knows who the doctor is but peinforte says that she does when ace asks how she says the nemesis told her the doctor asks what will happen if he gives her the bow to which peinforte replies his power will be hers but his secrets remain his own appearing to concede defeat the doctor says he is surrendering but not to peinforte rather to the cybermen peinforte threatens to reveal his secret but he just tells her to proceed she says that she will tell them of gallifrey of the old time the time of chaos however the cyberleader says that the secrets of the time lords are of no interest of the cybermen the cyberleader tells the doctor to cancel the nemesis s destructive capabilities the doctor asks the statue if she understands the cyberleader s instructions and she replies perfectly the triumphant cyberleader tells the doctor to set that statue s course to rendezvous with the cyberfleet he tells them that the earth will become their new base planet the new mondas launching the nemesis peinforte screams and throws herself into the rocket sled and merges with the nemesis the rocket sled takes off and heads out into space it arrives in the midst of the cyber fleet and there is an enormous explosion destroying all of the cyber warships the cyberleader asks how it is possible and the doctor replies that he merely asked if nemesis had understood the instruction but had not said anything about obeying them the cyberleader prepares to kill the doctor but richard grabs the gold tipped arrow from the tardis door and stabs it into the cyberleader s chest unit finally killing it the doctor and ace return richard to 1638 there richard and a

banks cyber lieutenant mark hardy cyberman brian orrell jazz quartet courtney pine adrian read ernest mothle frank tontoh cast notes the first episode of this serial features a brief guest appearance by the british jazz musician courtney pine as himself in print a novelisation of this serial written by kevin clarke was published by target books in november 1989 continuity when ace refers to the doctor as a time lord lady peinforte is shown shaking her head as if to say no the significance of this is never expanded upon in the story nor in any of the remaining televised seventh doctor stories although a deleted scene from remembrance of the daleks had the seventh doctor claiming that he was far more than just another time lord and deleted scenes from survival would have featured the master challenging the doctor s claim to be a time lord these are part of what fans have dubbed the cartmel masterplan an attempt by the show s script editor to revise some say retcon elements of the doctor in order to return some mystery to the character the series was cancelled before this could be followed up on screen although the spirit of the masterplan was carried out in the subsequent original novels see the other while the cybermen s vulnerability to gold had been known of since revenge of the cybermen the cybermen are far more vulnerable to it in this story than they were previously in earthshock the doctor had to feed fragments of gold directly into the cyber leader s chest unit and while the leader was damaged the doctor needed to shoot it several times in order to finally kill it in this serial even a low force impact with a gold or gold plated object proves instantly fatal to the cybermen this is the last episode of the classic series to feature the cybermen the doctor says that lady peinforte can use black magic the first time in the series that magic has been referred to and not immediately dismissed as trickery in the curse of fenric it was implied that fenric itself had manipulated these events to some degree leaving the question open as to whether peinforte used magic or merely believed she was using magic the literal use of nazis continued the theme begun earlier that year by remembrance of the daleks which returned to the original terry nation metaphor of the daleks as nazis many fans have commented on the similarity of this story with remembrance as well both stories involve the doctor manipulating old enemies into destroying themselves with an artefact from gallifrey s past production working titles for this story included the harbinger and nemesis in this serial the doctor briefly encounters queen elizabeth ii played by an actress the producers attempted to get the real monarch to appear on the program just as members of the british royal family had appeared as themselves on coronation street but arrangements could not be agreed permission was also refused for filming at windsor castle scenes set there were instead shot at arundel castle outside references the appearance of anton diffring as an aging nazi was topical as at the time the federal president of austria kurt waldheim the same age as diffring and an officer in the german army during the second world war was accused of being a nazi broadcast and video releases episodes two and three were the second and third respectively of the series ever to be premiered outside of the united kingdom the first being the five doctors being shown as part of a compilation broadcast of the story on new zealand s tvnz after part one had shown in the uk but prior to the other two being transmitted there on 3 may 1993 an extended version of this three part serial was released on vhs apart from featuring footage not shown in the original broadcast the video included a

and his early signature tune don t ask me questions which hit the top 40 in the uk parker and the rumour built a reputation as incendiary live performers the promotional album live at marble arch was recorded at this time and shows off their raw onstage style like the pub rock scene he was loosely tied to the singer s class conscious lyrics and passionate vocals signaled a renewal of rock music as punk rock began to flower in britain parker preceded the other new wave english singer songwriters elvis costello and joe jackson early in his career his work was often compared favorably to theirs and for decades journalists would continue to categorize them together long after the artists work had diverged characteristically parker would not hesitate to criticize this habit with caustic wit the first 2 albums critical acclaim was generally not matched with lp sales graham parker and the rumour appeared on bbc television s top of the pops in 1976 performing their top 30 hit version of the trammps hold back the night at this point parker began to change his songwriting style reflecting his desire to break into the american market the first fruits of this new direction appeared on stick to me 1977 the album broke the top 20 on the uk charts but divided critical opinions particularly with numbers like the heat in harlem the band s longest song at the time nick lowe s production also came under fire some critics complained that the band sounded thin and parker s voice was mixed down when in fact a studio mishap had compromised the original recordings and forced the group to remake the album on short notice an official live album the parkerilla issued in 1978 showed that the rumour s vibrant live style remained strong though some critics saw parker in a holding pattern 2 years after heat treatment it was a crucial juncture for the young musician parker had long been dissatisfied with the performance of his us record company mercury records finally issuing in the 1979 single mercury poisoning a public kiss off reminiscent of the sex pistols emi energized by his new label arista and the presence of legendary producer jack nitzsche parker followed with squeezing out sparks widely held to be the best album of his career for this album the rumour s brass section prominent on all previous albums was jettisoned resulting in a spare intense rock backing for some of parker s most brilliant songs of particular note was you can t be too strong one of rock music s rare songs to confront the topic of abortion however ambivalently squeezing out sparks is still ranked by fans and critics alike as one of the finest rock albums ever made rolling stone named it 335 on their 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in an early 1987 rolling stone list of their top 100 albums from 1967 1987 squeezing out sparks was ranked at 45 while howlin wind came in at 54 the companion live album live sparks sent to us radio stations as part of a concerted promotional campaign for parker showed how well the songs worked on stage and included another snapping r b cover the jackson 5 s i want you back although marginally less intense than its predecessor 1980 s the up escalator was parker s highest charting album in the uk and featured glossy production by jimmy iovine and guest vocals from bruce springsteen nevertheless it was parker s last album with the rumour although guitarist brinsley schwarz would join most of the singer s albums through the decade s end the 1980s were parker s most commercially successful years with well financed recordings and radio and video play over the decade the british press turned unkind to him but he continued to tour the world with top backing bands and his 1985 release steady nerves included his only us top 40 hit wake up next to you the singer began living mostly in the united states during this time an uncompromising attitude toward his music ensured that parker would clash with the changing priorities of the major label music business and the label changes came quickly after the mid 1980s this situation partly accounts for the remarkable number of compilation albums in graham parker s discography particularly unproductive was parker s tenure at atlantic records where he has said he was told to collaborate with other songwriters and to focus on a big drum sound instead parker ended the deal and signed to rca records he began producing his own recordings and stripping down his sound with the mona lisa s sister a success in the new modern rock format the groundbreaking work gained the singer renewed critical attention for his followup albums after the movingly personal 12 haunted episodes his first release on an independent record label parker grew quiet in the late 1990s but began an extraordinarily active period in 2001 with the uk rerelease of his early rumour work and with deepcut to nowhere a penetrating collection of new songs that seemed intended to reflect comprehensively on the singer s life and aims the new work continued with 2004 s your country which was released on chicago based indie bloodshot records and while presented as a flirtation with country music had

americas particularly in the united states and canada d amps is considered end of life and existing networks are in the process of being replaced by gsm gprs and cdma2000 technologies although this system is most often referred to as tdma this name is based on the acronym for time division multiple access a common multiple access technique which is used by multiple protocols including gsm as well as in is 54 and is 136 the two different uses of this term can be confusing tdma the technique is also used in the gsm standard however tdma the standard i e is 136 has been competing against gsm and systems based on code division multiple access cdma for adoption by the network carriers although it is now being phased out in favor of gsm technology d amps uses existing amps channels and allows for smooth transition between digital and analog systems in the same area capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 khz channel pair into three time slots hence time division and digitally compressing the voice data yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell a digital system also made calls more secure because analog scanners could not access digital signals calls were encrypted although the algorithm used cmea was later found to be weak is 136 added a number of features to the original is 54 specification including text messaging circuit switched data csd and an improved compression protocol sms and csd were both available as part of the gsm protocol and is 136 implemented them in a nearly identical fashion large is 136 networks include cingular wireless and u s cellular in the united states and rogers wireless in canada cingular who purchased at t wireless in october 2004 and rogers wireless have upgraded their existing is 136 networks to gsm gprs while us cellular is migrating most of their network to cdma2000 rogers wireless removed all 1900 mhz is 136 in 2003 and is slowly doing the same with their 800 mhz spectrum as the equipment fails it is not unusual for a rogers d amps customer to have coverage in a specific location one day and then none in that same area the next rogers will deactivate their is 136 network along with amps in may 2007 is 54 is the first mobile communication system which had provision for security and the first to employ tdma technology introduction is 54 stands for interim standard 54 which is a mobile communication standard employing digital technology standards in general establish the compatibility and performance requirements for technology standards assist manufacturers service providers and end users to build buy and use products that provide mutually agreed upon features functionality and performance standards also facilitate the interoperability of products built by different manufacturers with standards the service provider and end user have more choices in products than would otherwise be available and likewise manufacturers have greater access to market than otherwise is 54 was standardized by electronic industries alliance eia and telecommunications industry association tia together it later became an american national standard when it got approved by the american national standards institute ansi when an interim standard becomes an american national standard the is designator is dropped the ansi designation of is 54 is ansi tia eia 627 but this standard is still popularly referred to as is 54 is 54 maintains compatibility with advanced mobile phone system amps in many ways it is a digital extension of amps and so it is also quite widely known as digital amps d amps another name for is 54 is united states digital cellular usdc but sometimes d amps and usdc also refers to the other prominent interim standard is 136 history the evolution of mobile communication has been almost wholly in 3 different geographic regions the standards that were born in these regions were quite independent the 3 regions are north america europe and japan the earlier mobile or wireless technologies were wholly analog and are collectively known as 1st generation 1g technologies in japan the 1g standards were nippon telegraph and telephone ntt and the high capacity version of it hicap the european systems were not common and the european union viewpoint that is visible in the later technologies was absent various 1g standards that were in use in europe include c netz in germany and austria comviq in sweden nordic mobile telephones 450 nmt450 nmt900 both in nordic countries nmt f french version of nmt900 radiocom 2000 rc2000 in france total access communication system tacs in the united kingdom north american standards were advanced mobile phone system amps and narrow band amps n amps out of the 1g standards the most successful was the amps system despite the nordic countries cooperation the european intellect got divided to various standards and the japanese standards didn t get much attention developed by bell labs in the 1970s and first used commercially in the united states in 1983 amps operates in the 800 and 1900 mhz band in the united states and is the most widely distributed analog cellular standard amps was undoubtedly the leader of the 1g mobile communication systems the success of amps kicked start the mobile age in the north america the markets showed an increasing demand because it had higher capacity and mobility than the then existing mobile communication standards for instance the bell labs system in the 1970s could carry only 12 calls at a time throughout all of new york city amps used frequency division multiple access fdma which meant each cell site would transmit on different frequencies allowing many cell sites to be built near each other however amps had many disadvantages too primarily it didn t have the potential to support the increasing demand for mobile communication usage each cell site did not have much capacity for carrying higher numbers of calls it also had a poor security system which allowed people to steal a phone s serial code to use for making illegal calls all of these triggered the search for a more capable system the quest resulted in is 54 the first american 2g standard in march 1990 the north american cellular network incorporated the is 54b standard the first north american dual mode digital cellular standard this standard won over motorola s narrowband amps or n amps an analog scheme that increased capacity by cutting down voice channels from 30 khz to 10 khz is 54 on the other hand increased capacity by digital means using tdma time division multiple access protocols this method separates calls by time placing parts of individual conversations on the same frequency one after the next tdma tripled call capacity using is 54 a cellular carrier could convert any of its systems analog voice channels to digital a dual mode phone uses digital channels where available and defaults to regular amps where they are not is 54 was in fact backward compatible with analog cellular and indeed co exists on the same radio channels as amps no analog customers were left behind they simply couldn t access is 54 s new features is 54 also supported authentication a help in preventing fraud technology specifications is 54 employs the same 30 khz channel spacing and frequency bands 824 849 and 869 894 mhz as amps capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 khz channel pair into three time slots and digitally compressing the voice data yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell a digital system also made calls more secure because analog scanners could not access digital signals the is 54 standard specifies 84 control channels 42 of which are shared with amps to maintain compatibility with the existing amps cellular telephone system the primary forward and reverse control channels in is 54 cellular systems use the same signaling techniques and modulation scheme binary fsk as amps an amps is 54 infrastructure can support use of either analog amps phones or d amps phones the access method used for is 54 is time division multiple access tdma which was the first u s digital standard to be developed it was adopted by the tia in 1992 tdma subdivides each of the 30 khz amps channels into 3 full rate tdma channels each of which is capable of supporting a single voice call later each of these full rate channels was further sub divided into two half rate channels each of which with the necessary coding and compression could also support a voice call thus tdma could provide 3 to 6 times the capacity of amps traffic channels time division multiple access or tdma was initially defined by the is 54 standard and is now specified in the is 13x series of specifications of the eia tia the channel transmission bit rate for digitally modulating the carrier is 48 6 kbit s each frame has six time slots of 6 67 ms duration each time slot carries 324 bits of information of which 260 bits are for the 13 kbit s full rate traffic data the other 64 bits are overhead 28 of these are for synchronization and they contain a specific bit sequence known by all receivers to establish frame alignment also as with gsm the known sequence acts as a training pattern to initialize an adaptive equalizer the is 54 system has different synchronization sequences for each of the six time slots making up the frame thereby allowing each receiver to synchronize to its own preassigned time slots an additional 12 bits in every time slot are for the sacch i e system control information the digital verification color code dvcc is the equivalent of the supervisory audio tone used in the amps system there are 256 different 8 bit color codes which are protected by a 12 8 3 hamming code each base station has its own preassigned color code so any incoming interfering signals from distant cells can be ignored the modulation scheme for is 54 is 7c 4 differential quaternary phase shift keying dqpsk otherwise known as differential 7t 4 4 psk or 4 dqpsk this technique allows a bit rate of 48 6 kbit s with 30 khz channel spacing to give a bandwidth efficiency of 1 62 b s hz this value is 20 better than gsm the major disadvantage with this type of linear modulation method is the power inefficiency which translates into a heavier hand held portable and even more inconvenient a shorter time between battery recharges is 54 security features is also a matter of interest as it was the first standard to specify some security measures is 54 uses the cave cellular authentication voice privacy and encryption algorithm for authentication and the cmea cellular message encryption algorithm for encryption the technical specifications can be summarized as below call processing a conversation s data bits makes up the data field six slots make up a complete is 54 frame data in slots 1 and 4 2 and 5 and 3 and 6 make up a voice circuit dvcc stands for digital verification color code arcane terminology for a unique 8 bit code value assigned to each cell g means guard time the period between each time slot rsvd stands for reserved sync represents synchronization a critical tdma data field each slot in every frame must be synchronized against all others and a master clock for everything to work time slots for the mobile to base direction are constructed differently from the base to mobile direction they essentially carry the same information but are arranged differently notice that the mobile to base direction has a 6 bit ramp time to enable its transmitter time to get up to full power and a 6 bit guard band during which nothing is transmitted these 12 extra bits in the base to mobile direction are reserved for future use once a call comes in the mobile switches to a different pair of frequencies a voice radio channel which the system carrier has made analog or digital this pair carries the call if an is 54 signal is detected it gets assigned a digital traffic channel if one is available the fast associated channel or facch performs handoffs during the call with no need for the mobile to go back to the control channel in case of high noise facch embedded within the digital traffic channel overrides the voice payload degrading speech quality to convey control information the purpose is to maintain connectivity the slow associated control channel or sacch does not perform handoffs but conveys things like signal strength information to the base station the is 54 speech coder uses the technique called vector sum excited linear prediction vselp coding this is a special type of speech coder within a large class known as code excited linear prediction celp coders the speech coding rate of 7 95 kbit s achieves a reconstructed speech quality similar to that of the analog amps system using frequency modulation the 7 95 kbit s signal is then passed through a channel coder that loads the bit rate up to 13 kbit s the new half rate coding standard reduces the overall bit rate for each call to 6 5 kbit s and should provide comparable quality to the 13 kbit s rate this half rate gives a channel capacity six times

integers a and b even when they are not coprime outside number theory the term multiplicative is usually used for functions with the property f ab f a f b for all arguments a and b this requires either f 1 1 or f a 0 for all a except a 1 this article discusses number theoretic multiplicative functions examples examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory such as n euler s totient function counting the positive integers coprime to but not bigger than n n the möbius function related to the number of prime factors of square free numbers gcd n k the greatest common divisor of n and k where k is a fixed integer d n the number of positive divisors of n n the sum of all the positive divisors of n k n the divisor function which is the sum of the k th powers of all the positive divisors of n where k may be any complex number in special cases we have 0 n d n and 1 n n 1 n the constant function defined by 1 n 1 completely multiplicative the indicator function of the set of squares or cubes or fourth powers etc id n identity function defined by id n n completely multiplicative idk n the power functions defined by idk n nk for any natural or even complex number k completely multiplicative as special cases we have id0 n 1 n and id1 n id n n the function defined by n 1 if n 1 and 0 if n 1 sometimes called multiplication unit for dirichlet convolution or simply the unit function sometimes written as u n not to be confused with n completely multiplicative n p the legendre symbol where p is a fixed prime number completely multiplicative n the liouville function related to the number of prime factors dividing n completely multiplicative n defined by n 1 n where the additive function n is the number of distinct primes dividing n all dirichlet characters are completely multiplicative functions an example of a non multiplicative function is the arithmetic function r2 n the number of representations of n as a sum of squares of two integers positive negative or zero where in counting the number of ways reversal of order is allowed for example 1 12 02 1 2 02 02 12 02 1 2 and therefore r2 1 4 1 this shows that the function is not multiplicative however r2 n 4 is multiplicative in the on line encyclopedia of integer sequences sequences of values of a multiplicative function have the keyword mult see arithmetic function for some other examples of non multiplicative functions properties a multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of prime numbers a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic thus if n is a product of powers of distinct primes say n pa qb then f n f pa f qb this property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation as in the following examples for n 144 24 32 d 144 0 144 0 24 0 32 10 20 40 80 160 10 30 90 5 3 15 144 1 144 1 24 1 32 11 21 41 81 161 11 31 91 31 13 403 144 24 32 11 161 11 91 17 10 170 similarly we have 144 24 32 8 6 48 in general if f n is a multiplicative function and a b are any two positive integers then f a f b f gcd a b f lcm a b every completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism of monoids and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers convolution if f and g are two multiplicative functions one defines a new multiplicative function f g the dirichlet convolution of f and g by where the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n with this operation the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group the identity element

convolution can be defined for general arithmetic functions and yields a ring structure the dirichlet ring proving convolution identities there is a very useful theorem for proving convolution identities which says that if f g and h are multiplicative and one wants to prove that then it suffices to prove it for powers of primes the proof of this theorem is by mathematical induction on the number of distinct prime factors of n the base case of the induction is that n has just one prime factor in which case because we assumed that it holds for powers of primes for the induction step let start with and split the set of divisors of n into those that are coprime to p and those that are not using the fact that f and g are multiplicative this becomes now has one fewer prime factor than so by the induction hypothesis we have which yields or because we assumed the convolution holds for powers of primes and by multiplicativity of h qed we may now prove some convolution identities of multiplicative functions by verifying that they hold for powers of primes first example moebius inversion we have this certainly holds for powers of primes where the left evaluates to this proves the moebius inversion formula through second example the classic totient identity we show that the left is third example the square of the divisor function we show that where is the indicator function of the set of naturals that are squares the right is the left is now there are two cases depending on whether v is even or odd let where this gives next let where this in turn gives fourth example an

 id=165704 title hells canyon nonfiltered 436 processed 432 dbindex 450439 hells canyon is a canyon created by the snake river there is no recognized geographic place called hells canyon according to a book by r g bailey titled hells canyon it starts 90 miles 145 km south of lewiston idaho and extends 40 miles 64 km further south to a point near oxbow oregon however some would dispute this definition the canyon is located within hells canyon national recreation area general in the 1950s the name hells canyon was borrowed from hells canyon creek which enters the river near what is now hells canyon dam according to carrey conley and barton in their book snake river of hells canyon most of the early explorers referred to the gorge as box canyon or snake river canyon though a few locals called it the grand canyon of the snake the first reference to hells canyon appears in an 1895 edition of mccurdy s marine history of the pacific northwest in discussing the voyage of the steamboat norma the author writes she then bounded off swinging into midstream and like a racehorse shot into the hell canyon the name was used by the mazama hiking club in their 1931 bulletin bailey s book hells canyon was published in 1943 senator neuberger of oregon used it in several publications in the 1950s the hells canyon area was once home to shoshone and nez percé native american tribes according to the nez percé tribe coyote dug the snake river canyon in a day to protect the people on the west side of the river from the seven devils a band of evil spirits living in the mountain range to the east in the late nineteenth century the military drove the native americans out and settlers began ranching and mining in the canyon hells canyon is one of the most imposing river gorges in the north american west until a million years ago the owyhee mountains acted as a dam between the snake river and its current confluence with the columbia river creating a vast lake in what is now southwestern idaho when the mountains were finally breached the snake roared northward cutting a giant chasm through the volcanic rock most of the older rocks we see in the canyon came from underwater volcanoes when hells canyon s terrains were part of an island arc in the mid pacific ocean these complex terrains glued themselves to north america about 150 million years ago as a result of tectonic plate movement vast areas were later covered with successive lava flows as recently as 6 million years ago uplifting from deep in the earth s core formed the seven devils and eagle cap mountains a process that continues today the canyon itself is a result of both uplifting and erosion one can see recent basalt flows limestone formed on the ocean floor ancient lavas alluvial deposits and the remains of primeval swamps that grew on the island surfaces the resulting canyon roughly 10 miles 16 km across is not as dramatic as the grand canyon however when the surrounding peaks are visible from the river the sense of depth is tremendous the adjacent ridges average 5 500 feet 1 700 m above the river he devil mountain tallest of the seven devils 9 393 ft 2 863 m towers almost 8 000 ft 2

iii iv most of the difficult rapids are at the beginning then the pace of the trip slows considerably the two major rapids wild sheep and granite creek should be treated with respect especially at high flows at high flows these rapids can easily flip the largest rafts those with kayaks and other small boats can portage these rapids the remainder of the trip while still offering some exciting rapids is mostly serene to avoid the slower water in the lower canyon many boaters take out at pittsburg landing mile 32 roughly half of all trips end there trip length for those traveling the river

platoon commander in his battalion his men reported that they appreciated the extra training drills he put them through return to iraq 2004 pantano went to iraq in february of 2004 with 2nd battalion 2nd marines this was quickly followed by the intense fighting in fallujah during operation vigilant resolve in april 2004 on april 15 2004 acting on intelligence extracted from captured opposition

secured the compound the compound was deserted but his men found a cache of arms including several mortar aiming stakes a flare gun three ak47 rifles 10 ak magazines with assault vests and ied making material when pantano learned that the compound contained weapons he ordered sergeant daniel coburn and corpsman george gobles to watch for enemies he then released the captives from their bonds according to a statement lieutenant pantano made to military investigators in june 2004 he then used hand signals to order the captives to search the vehicle again according to pantano during the search of the vehicle he felt the iraqis posed a threat to him they were talking and pantano believed they were conspiring together when they both turned to face each other he shouted stop in both arabic and english and when they did not he shot them after emptying his magazine he continued to fire he later stated i then changed magazines and continued to fire until the second magazine was empty i had made a decision that when i was firing i was going to send a message to these iraqis and others that when we say no better friend no worse enemy we mean it i had fired both magazines into the men hitting them with about 80 percent of my rounds indictment in june 2004 sergeant coburn registered a complaint about the incident triggering a naval criminal investigative service probe on february 1 2005 pantano was charged with two counts of premeditated murder and faced the death penalty if convicted article 32 hearing on april 14 2005 pantano tried to waive his right to an article 32 pretrial hearing in an effort to speed the process toward a court martial pantano claimed that the government was withholding key evidence and witnesses and according to a statement made by his mother waived his right to a hearing in order to get a military judge to compel the prosecution to produce witnesses and evidence in his case the military denied this request and the article 32 hearing was held on april 26 2005 with major mark winn as the presiding officer autopsy report prior to pantano s article 32 hearing the department of defense had maintained that it was impossible to do a post mortem examination on the corpses of lieutenant pantano s captives because they were buried in a cemetery that was in an area that was not under american control however shortly before the hearing the bodies were exhumed after all the autopsy report was released the day after the article 32 recommendation was made and according to the washington times supported lt pantano s version of events pantano s statements pantano acknowledged leaving a sign on a car above the corpses that said no better friend no worse enemy but then returned to remove it after one of his colleagues called it inappropriate this phrase is the motto of his marine corps battalion and is promoted by his battalion commander as the combat philosophy of their unit the slogan is also a popular marine saying popularized by lieutenant general james mattis then commanding general of the 1st marine division in an interview with the bbc from march 20 2005 lieutenant pantano said i m a new yorker and 9 11 was a pretty significant event for me our duty as marines is quite frankly to export violence to the four corners of the globe to make sure that this doesn t happen again witnesses medical corpsman george goble was present but did not witness the danger lieutenant pantano reported because he was looking outwards as ordered he later stated when he turned back he saw the iraqis trying to run away sergeant coburn is reported to have said as soon as i turned my back lt pantano opened with approximately 45 rounds coburn throughout the case gave five distinctly separate versions of events lieutenant pantano s defense counsels have said they believe that sergeant daniel coburn s account should not be given any credit because he was disgruntled having been demoted recently by pantano another witness corporal o was an arabic speaking nigerian american in pantano s platoon his full name was kept confidential at pantano s hearing because he is being trained for counter intelligence duties in his testimony at pantano s hearing corporal o described interviewing the two captives he described seeing the vehicle being searched by other marines including the removal of its seats he described seeing the corpses of the captives following the shooting face down with the heads and torsos in the vehicle and their knees resting on the ground as if pantano shot the captives in the back while they were kneeling facing the vehicle corporal o described the sight as weird sergeant coburn was heavily criticized for some interviews he had given he was under a gag order as well as untruths concerning the evidence in the case coburn s internet statements the blogosphere also played a major role coburn made remarks on euphoric reality during the case that were in direct contradiction of his statements to naval investigators the blog owner turned in the comments to pantano s attorney who confronted coburn on the stand with his own remarks in a dramatic cross examination that resulted in coburn being taken off the stand and read his miranda rights coburn returned to the stand the following day after being granted immunity another marine officer lt graham hopkins was a classmate of pantano s during officer candidate school hopkins was slated to testify for the prosecution as a character witness against pantano and his testimony included anecdotes about pantano s personality and leadership style while in training however hopkins was not allowed to testify after he and his mother were found making the same type of comments as coburn on military blogs covering the case hopkins own record was also called into question as his overall leadership ranking during officer school was last in the class of 192 students pantano was ranked fifth recommendations major winn recommended to major general huck commander of lieutenant pantano s division that the murder charges be dropped it was his assessment that sergeant coburn was an uncredible witness he did however recommend that pantano receive nonjudicial punishment for conduct unbecoming an officer for the sign he left on the corpses he described lieutenant pantano s treatment of his captive s corpses as a desecration under u s military law the decision as to whether a court martial should take place lay solely with the general commanding lieutenant pantano s division and he decided to dismiss all charges as a result of this decision lieutenant pantano s case was not referred to a court martial for a determination of his guilt or innocence website internet threats on february 12 2005 lieutenant pantano s mother appeared on cnn to publicize his case and to tell the public about the site she founded for his defense the website created by pantano s mother reported that that the iraqis had advanced on him in a threatening manner that he had ordered them to stop and fired on them in self defense when they failed to do so prior to the press finding access to lieutenant pantano s statement journalists and bloggers sympathetic to pantano echoed the version on his mother s website on february 17 2005 it was reported that ms pantano s site went down and a parallel site with a similar name went up it was reported that the parallel site contained threats against pantano and his family that it contained a video simulating pantano being decapitated retired marines are reported to have volunteered to

villafañe traveled to pánuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site which had already been visited from that community he arrived in time to greet garcía de escalante alvarado a nephew of pedro de alvarado commander of the salvage operation when alvarado arrived by sea on july 22 1554 the team labored until september 12 to salvage the padre island treasure this loss in combination with other ship disasters around the gulf of mexico gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern gulf coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways as a result the expedition of tristán de luna y arellano was sent and landed at pensacola bay on august 15 1559 angel de villafañe was involved in the luna expedition from the start before it sailed he took charge of the encampment at jalapa while luna himself traveled to veracruz to complete arrangements for the voyage afterward commanding the san juan de ulúa garrison stationed at veracruz villafañe was able to monitor the operation and report back to the viceroy luis de velasco over a year later when luna proved incapable of managing the settlements at florida and santa elena viceroy velasco then sent villafañe to replace him tristán de luna y arellano had suffered disease in trying to relocate the ochuse settlement decimated by the hurricane of september 19 1559 and most native food corn beans pumpkins was also depleted villafañe reached the ochuse pensacola settlement in early march 1561 and on april 9 he assumed authority as governor of both provinces of la florida and punta de santa elena in replacing luna leaving 50 men at ochuse villafañe sailed the rest of the colony about 230 persons to santa elena georgia near south carolina after several landings along the carolina coast while seeking a suitable port the fleet was struck by another hurricane but some ships survived villafañe sailed his storm battered fleet to hispaniola and then to havana cuba where many of his soldiers scattered after three months in cuba villafañe returned to ochuse pensacola bay to remove the remaining 50 men of the colony sailing back to mexico along with other participants in the florida santa elena attempt villafañe was summoned by viceroy velasco to offer advice on future settlements the conferees concluded a negative assessment of settlements on both the gulf coast and the atlantic coast future efforts on the atlantic seaboard were to be made from spain and no new enterprise was undertaken on the northern gulf shore until after the landing of rené robert cavelier sieur

 id=296639 title arrow of time nonfiltered 464 processed 460 dbindex 450467 this article is an overview of the subject for a more technical discussion and for information related to current research see entropy arrow of time in the natural sciences arrow of time or time s arrow is a term coined in 1927 by british astronomer arthur eddington used to distinguish a direction of time on a four dimensional relativistic map of the world which according to eddington can be determined by a study of organizations of atoms molecules and bodies physical processes at the microscopic level are either entirely or mostly time symmetric meaning that the theoretical statements that describe them remain true if the direction of time is reversed yet when we describe things at the macroscopic level it often appears that this is not the case there is an obvious direction or flow of time an arrow of time is anything that exhibits such time asymmetry history of term from the 1928 book the nature of the physical world which helped to popularize the term eddington states let us draw an arrow arbitrarily if as we follow the arrow we find more and more of the random element in the state of the world then the arrow is pointing towards the future if the random element decreases the arrow points towards the past that is the only distinction known to physics this follows at once if our fundamental contention is admitted that the introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone i shall use the phrase time s arrow to express this one way property of time which has no analogue in space eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow it is vividly recognized by consciousness it is equally insisted on by our reasoning faculty which tells us that a reversal of the arrow would render the external world nonsensical it makes no appearance in physical science except in the study of organization of a number of individuals here according to eddington the arrow indicates the direction of progressive increase of the random element following a lengthy argument into the nature of thermodynamics eddington concludes that in so far as physics is concerned time s arrow is a property of entropy alone overview the symmetry of time t symmetry can be understood by a simple analogy if time were perfectly symmetric then it would be possible to watch a movie taken of real events and everything that happens in the movie would seem realistic whether it was played forwards or backwards for example a movie showing a cup falling off a table seems realistic when run forwards but seems unrealistic if run backwards on the other hand a movie of the planets orbiting the sun would look equally realistic run forwards or backwards either way the orbital motions would appear to conform to physical laws an example of irreversibility consider the situation in which a large container is filled with two separated liquids for example a dye on one side and water on the other with no barrier between the two liquids the random jostling of their molecules will result in them becoming more mixed as time passes however if the dye and water are mixed then one does not expect them to separate out again when left to themselves a movie of the mixing would seem realistic when played forwards but unrealistic when played backwards if the large container is observed early on in the mixing process it might be found to be only partially mixed it would be reasonable to conclude that without outside intervention the liquid reached this state because it was more ordered in the past when there was greater separation and will be more disordered or mixed in the future now imagine that the experiment is repeated this time with only a few molecules perhaps ten in a very small container one can easily imagine that by watching the random jostling of the molecules it might occur by chance alone that the molecules became neatly segregated with all dye molecules on one side and all water molecules on the other that this can be expected to occur from time to time can be concluded from the fluctuation theorem thus it is not impossible for the molecules to segregate themselves however for a large numbers of molecules it is so unlikely that one would have to wait on average longer than the age of the universe for it to occur thus a movie that showed a large number of molecules segregating themselves as described above would appear unrealistic and one would be inclined to say that the movie was being played in reverse see also another example arrows the thermodynamic arrow of time the thermodynamic arrow of time is provided by the second law of thermodynamics which says that in an isolated system entropy will only increase with time it will not decrease with time entropy can be thought of as a measure of thus the second law implies that time is asymmetrical with respect to the amount of order in an isolated system as time increases a system will always become more disordered this asymmetry can be used empirically to distinguish between future and past the second law does not hold with strict universality any system can fluctuate to a state of lower entropy see the poincaré recurrence theorem however the second law seems accurately to describe the overall trend in real systems toward higher entropy this arrow of time seems to be related to all other arrows of time and arguably underlies some of them with the exception of the weak arrow of time see below the cosmological arrow of time the cosmological arrow of time points in the direction of the universe s expansion it may be linked to the thermodynamic arrow with the universe heading towards a heat death big chill as the amount of usable energy becomes negligible alternatively it may be an artifact of our place in the universe s evolution see the anthropic bias with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a big crunch if this arrow of time is related to the other arrows of time then the future is by definition the direction towards which the universe becomes bigger thus the universe expands rather than shrinks by definition the radiative arrow of time waves from radio waves to sound waves to those on a pond from throwing a stone expand outward from their source even though the wave equations allow for solutions of convergent waves as well as radiative ones this arrow has been reversed in carefully worked experiments which have created convergent waves so this arrow probably follows from the thermodynamic arrow in that meeting the conditions to produce a convergent wave requires more order than the conditions for a radiative wave put differently the probability for initial conditions that produce a convergent wave is much lower than the probability for initial conditions that produce a radiative wave in fact normally a radiative wave increases entropy while a convergent wave decreases it making the latter contradictory to the second law of thermodynamics in usual circumstances the causal arrow of time causes are ordinarily thought to precede effects the future can be controlled but not the past a problem with using causality as an arrow of time is that as david hume pointed out the causal relation per se cannot be perceived one only perceives sequences of events furthermore it is surprisingly difficult to provide a clear explanation of what the terms cause and effect really mean it does seem evident that dropping the plate is the cause the plate shattering is the effect however it may be that the asymmetry that the observer relies upon in such cases is really the thermodynamic one if the thermodynamic arrow were reversed then one would regard the gathering shards as the cause and the fused plate jumping up into our hands as the effect the weak arrow of time certain subatomic interactions involving the weak nuclear force violate the conservation of parity but only very rarely according to the cpt theorem this means they should also be time irreversible and so establish an arrow of time such processes should be responsible for matter creation in the early universe this arrow is not linked to any other arrow by any proposed mechanism and if it would have pointed to the opposite time direction the only difference would have been that our universe would be made of anti matter rather than from matter more accurately the definitions of matter and anti matter would just be reversed that parity is broken so rarely means that this arrow only barely points in one direction setting it apart from the other arrows whose direction is much more obvious the quantum arrow of time according the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics quantum evolution is governed by the schrödinger equation which is time symmetric and by wave function collapse which is time irreversible as the mechanism of wave function collapse is still obscure it s not known how this arrow links to the others while at the microscopic level collapse seems to show no favor to increasing or decreasing entropy some believe there is a bias which shows up on macroscopic scales as the thermodynamic arrow according to the theory of quantum decoherence and assuming that the wave function collapse is merely apparent the quantum arrow of time is a consequence of the thermodynamic arrow of time also see entropy arrow of time the psychological perceptual arrow of time psychological time is in part the cataloguing of ever increasing items of memory from continuous changes in perception in other words things we remember make up the past while the future consists of those events that cannot be remembered the ancient method of comparing unique events to generalized repeating events such as the apparent movement of the sun moon and stars provided a convenient grid work to accomplish this the consistent increase in memory volume creates one mental arrow of time another arises because one has the sense that one s perception is a continuous movement from the unknown future to the known past anticipating the unknown forms the psychological future which always seems to be something one is moving towards but like a projection in a mirror it makes what is actually already a part of memory such as desires dreams and hopes seem ahead of the observer even the association of behind past and ahead future may be culturally conditioned it was reported during 2006 that the aymara people associated ahead past and behind future the psychological arrow of time is thought to be reducible to the thermodynamic arrow it has deep connections with maxwell s demon and the physics of information in fact it is easy to understand its link to the second law of thermodynamics if we view memory as correlation between brain cells or computer bits and the outer world since the second law of thermodynamics is equivalent to the growth with time of such correlations then it states that memory will be created as we move towards the future rather than towards the past the other side of the psychological passage of time is in the realm of volition and action we plan and often execute actions intended to affect the course of events in the future hardly anyone tries to change past events indeed in the rubaiyat it is written sic the moving finger writes and having writ moves

 id=5857154 title appeasement of hitler nonfiltered 466 processed 462 dbindex 450469 the most well known case of appeasement is one which ultimately failed the appeasement of adolf hitler by british prime minister neville chamberlain s government in the late 1930s the munich agreement in particular stands as a major example of appeasement there is however a large historiographical debate about appeasement reasons why the british government appeased hitler the communist threat conservative politicians had to worry not only about the threat posed by hitler s germany but also about the threat posed by the stalinist soviet union as the holocaust had not yet occurred they mostly regarded stalin as the greater of the two totalitarian evils the fact that the united states was at the time in an extremely isolationist phase made the situation even more difficult they feared that as britain and france were busy fighting germany in the west the soviets would invade poland and then eastern germany after the war of german suppression germans and allies alike would be at the mercy of the soviet union essentially 1945 without the united states or the atomic bomb failure to recognise the dangers of nazism winston churchill was leader of the minority that recognised the military threat posed by a rearmed germany even if a 1938 war against germany was won the most likely regime to replace the nazis would be a military dictatorship alternatively a post nazi germany could have swung leftward forcing the western democracies to fight a german soviet alliance mistaken presumption that hitler was a rational actor like many other dictators diplomats of the time operated under the assumption that the nazi party and hitler were rational actors who would stop when their defined goals were achieved they believed hitler could be reasoned with and would stop his aggressive tactics and become peaceful once the unfair sections of versailles was sorted out the failure of this assumption led to containment policies by anti communist nations during the cold war perceived flaws of the treaty of versailles the treaty of versailles imposed many restrictions on internal german affairs which were later on widely viewed by the allied nations as being unfair to germany many people argued that german rearmament the reoccupation of the rhineland and the acquisition of the saarland were merely examples of the germans taking back what was rightfully theirs they also believed that since versailles had created the states of poland and czechoslovakia on the basis of self determination it was unjust to deny the opportunity of austrians and sudetenlanders to join germany if they so wished because hitler had not taken any obviously non german territory as of 1938 a war launched by the allies at this stage would have been a war launched merely on the basis of suspicion in which britain would be deeply divided this could have been fatal if the war had gone badly for the allies as indeed happened in 1940 by 1939 hitler had annexed the very non german city of prague meaning that self determination could no longer be used to justify his actions this made a decision to go to war in 1939 far easier than in 1938 the economic impact of world war i the national debt of britain increased tenfold during the war and the increase of british government debt to foreign governments during wwi mainly to america led to a high interest rate being charged the british government therefore had to try to cut back on spending and the public would not stomach cutting back on domestic spending the geddes committee of 1921 22 recommended that the armed forces and weapons be reduced but this would eventually lead to a time delay when it came to rearmament during the 1930s the price of rearming would have a crippling effect on the british government and so the avoidance of war was a sound economic policy besides one can argue that it was not until the post war period after the large scale centralisation of the government that the british civil service was really capable of raising allocating and taxing the funds required of the large scale spending that would be necessary to rearm effectively peace for our time chamberlain s peace for our time deal i e the surrender of the sudetenland to germany with hitler was internationally acclaimed and praised at home and abroad by among others pope pius xi ireland s eamon de valera the united states administration of franklin d roosevelt and canada s mackenzie king chamberlain was acclaimed by many british people for avoiding another war he was greeted by cheering crowds on the balcony of buckingham palace alongside king george vi and queen elizabeth who themselves supported his policy both having lost friends and relatives in the last war a voice condemning the agreement came in the publication that very same day of the best selling penguin special europe and the czechs by s grant duff a copy of which was delivered to each member of parliament as the publishers state the volume was written at their request and was completed as late as the first week of september and sold in the hundreds of thousands of copies the munich agreement marked the high tide of appeasement but was also the turning point in british public opinion many regarded the surrender of czechoslovakia the only remaining democracy in central europe with disgust especially as it had a well armed and trained army the labour party which until relatively recently had been condemning the tories for their bellicosity now attacked the appeasers as the men of munich and switched firmly into the pro war camp origins of the concept of the western betrayal the czechoslovak leaders and the population believed that if germany attacked france would meet its treaty obligation to czechoslovakia and attack germany they also believed that britain which unlike france had no treaty obligation to czechoslovakia would be drawn in too the soviet union also had a treaty obligation to come to the aid of czechoslovakia if france did there was no question of america acting as far as jan masaryk the son of the first czechoslovak president professor tomá garrigue masaryk was concerned it is when viewed against this background that the rationale and impact of chamberlain s agreement with hitler takes on less than desirable and laudable characteristic on september 27 1938 when negotiations between hitler and chamberlain were strained the british prime minister addressed the british people at the heart of why his critics view his policy as well meaning but ultimately wrong is this sentence from that speech how horrible fantastic incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing a mere 20 years before chamberlain addressed the british people regarding his agreement with hitler wwi ended in the treaty of versailles czechoslovakia was one of the original members of the league of nations signatories of the versailles treaty of peace part i articles 27 30 addresses the boundaries of germany part iii political clauses for europe section vii of that treaty addresses the czecho slovak state yet chamberlain characterised the czechs and the germans as people of whom we know nothing the peoples whose fate was being decided in munich were not invited to the negotiating table o nás bez nás about us without us became a phrase bitterly remembered by all czechs and slovaks neither were the peoples whose fates were being decided invited to the yalta conference in 1945 hopes were expressed by milan ekert czech pes group observer member of the european integration committee in 2003 without us but about us this sentence describes the history of the czech republic where a succession of larger powers have taken decisions about us without us after enlargement however all of this change for the first time in our history we can decide for ourselves and only because of this is it worth joining the eu chamberlain and rearmament however many of those that had been in government during the first world war were haunted by its effect and were determined to avoid any war in the future deeming all war futile chamberlain himself and his ministers were also aware of the lack of military capacity at their disposal part of that was the result of the belief subscribed to by many governing elites in the 1920s and early 1930s that war would no longer be an option and that military budgets could be tailored accordingly the european cycle of wars which in the previous seventy years had produced two massive conflicts the franco prussian war of 1870 and the first world war or great war as it was then called was thought to mark the end of old style european conflicts this was partly because of the horrors of 1914 18 that were thought to haunt all europeans the disappearance of old militarist monarchies like the hohenzollern monarchy of prussia and germany and the old system of secretive military alliances the triple entente and the triple alliance the apparent democratisation of europe which it was thought would mean that war could not be waged without the will of the people and after 1918 that will would no longer be there and as a result of the financial burdens fighting the great war and rebuilding states afterwards had imposed on individual exchequers in addition the apearance of the league of nations raised hope that there would now be other ways of resolving interstate disputes than military might because of this the old cycle of rearming for the next revenge conflict was thought to be broken the great depression after 1929 forced governments to cut expenditures in such circumstances a heavily funded military was thought neither politically possible nor financially viable faced with the growing political and economic instability in europe the rise in nazism and the increased irrelevance of the league of nations as a means to deal with disputes britain engaged in one of the most massive military build ups in modern history and instituted a peacetime draft the rearmament budget of 1937 amounted to 1 5 billion endofarticle doc doc

 id=9062 title daoud s republic of afghanistan nonfiltered 477 processed 473 dbindex 450480 daoud s republic july 17 1973 april 28 1978 the welcome mohammed daoud khan received on returning to power on july 17 1973 reflected the citizenry s disappointment with the lackluster politics of the preceding decade zahir shah s new democracy had promised much but had delivered little daoud s comeback was a return to traditional strongman rule and he was a particularly appealing figure to military officers as prime minister daoud had obtained large supplies of modern arms from the soviet union and he had been a former army officer himself also his strong position on the pashtunistan issue had not been forgotten by conservative pashtun officers daoud discussed rebellion for more than a year with various opposition elements both moderates and leftists including military officers who were members of both the khalqi and parchami factions of the people s democratic party of afghanistan certainly the communists had worked vigorously to undermine zahir shah s experiment in constitutional democracy their inflammatory speeches in parliament and organized street riots were tactics which alarmed zahir to the degree that he refused to sign the law legalizing political parties babrak karmal s parcham faction became integrally involved in planning the coup there is general agreement that daoud had been meeting with what he called various friends for more than a year the coup itself was carried out by junior officers trained in the soviet union some afghans suspected that daoud and karmal had been in touch for many years and that daoud had used him as an informant on the leftist movement no strong link can be cited to support this however other than the closeness between karmal s father an army general and daoud at the time of the july 1973 coup which took place when the king was in italy receiving eye treatment at the medicinal mud baths at ischia it was sometimes difficult to assess the factional and party affiliation of the officers who took place despite a number of conversions of parchamis to the khalqi faction by the time of the communist coup of april 1978 which overthrew daoud both party and factional loyalties became obvious after the pdpa took power although leftists had played a central role in the coup and despite the appointment of two leftists as ministers evidence suggests that the coup was daoud s alone officers personally loyal to him were placed in key positions while young parchamis were sent to the provinces probably to get them out of kabul until daoud had purged the leftist officers by the end of 1975 the next year daoud established his own political party the national revolutionary party which became the focus of all political activity in january 1977 a loya jirga approved daoud s constitution establishing a presidential one party system of government any resistance to the new regime was suppressed a coup attempt by mohammad hashim maiwandwal which may have been planned before daoud took power was subdued shortly after his coup in october 1973 maiwandwal a former prime minister and a highly respected former diplomat died in prison at a time when parchamis controlled the ministry of interior under circumstances corroborating the widespread belief that he had been tortured to death while both of the pdpa s factions had attempted to collaborate with daoud before the 1973 coup parcham used its advantage to recruit on an unprecedented scale immediately following the coup daoud however soon made it clear that he was no front man and that he had not adopted the claims of any ideological faction he began in the first months of his regime to ease parcharmis out of his cabinet perhaps not to alienate the soviet union daoud was careful to cite inefficiency and not ideological reasons for the dismissals khalq seeing an opportunity to make some short term gains at parcham s expense suggested to daoud that honest khalqis replace corrupt parchamis daoud wary of ideologues ignored this offer daoud s ties with the soviet union like his relations with afghan communists deteriorated during his five year presidency this loosening of ties with the soviet union was gradual daoud s shift to the right and realignment made the soviets anxious but western observers noted that daoud remained solicitous of soviet interests and afghanistan s representative in the united nations voted regularly with the soviet bloc or with the group of nonaligned countries the soviets remained by far afghanistan s largest aid donor and were influential enough to insist that no western activity economic or otherwise be permitted in northern afghanistan daoud still favored a state centered economy and three years after coming to power he drew up an ambitious seven year economic plan 1976 1983 that included major projects and required a substantial influx of foreign aid as early as 1974 daoud began distancing himself from over reliance on the soviet union for military and economic support that same year he formed a military training program with india and opened talks with iran on economic development aid daoud also turned to other oil rich muslim nations such as saudi arabia iraq and kuwait for financial assistance pashtunistan zealots confidently expected the new president to raise this issue with pakistan and in the first few months of the new regime bilateral relations were poor efforts by iran and the united states to cool a tense situation succeeded after a time and by 1977 relations between pakistan and afghanistan had notably improved during daoud s march 1978 visit to islamabad an agreement was reached whereby president muhammad zia ul haq of pakistan released pashtun and baloch militants from prison in exchange for daoud withdrawing support for these groups and expelling pashtun and baloch militants taking refuge in afghanistan daoud s initial visit to the soviet union in 1974 was friendly despite disagreement on the pashtunistan issue by the time of daoud s second visit in april 1977 the soviets knew of his purge of the left begun in 1975 his removal of soviet advisers from some afghan military units and his changes in military training whereby other nations especially india and egypt trained afghans with soviet weapons despite official goodwill unofficial reports circulated of sharp soviet criticism of anticommunists in daoud s new cabinet of his failure to cooperate with the pdpa and of his criticism of cuba s role in the non aligned movement furthermore daoud was friendly with iran and saudi arabia and he had scheduled a visit to washington dc for the spring of 1978 by 1978 daoud had achieved little of what he had set out to accomplish despite good harvests in 1973 and subsequent years no real economic progress had been made and the afghan standard of living had not improved by the spring of 1978 he had alienated most key political groups by gathering power into his own hands and refusing to tolerate dissent although muslim fundamentalists had been the object of repression as early as 1974 their numbers had nonetheless increased diehard pashtunistan supporters were disillusioned with daoud s rapprochement with pakistan especially by what they regarded as his commitment in the 1977 agreement not to aid pashtun militants in pakistan most ominous for daoud were developments among afghan communists in march 1977 despite reaching a fragile agreement on reunification parcham and khalq remained mutually suspicious the military arms of each faction were not coordinated because by this time khalqi military officers vastly outnumbered parchami officers and feared the latter might inform daoud of this raising his suspicion that a coup was imminent although plans for a coup had long been discussed according to a statement by hafizullah amin the april 1978 coup was implemented about two years ahead of time the april 19 1978 funeral for mir akbar khyber a prominent parchami ideologue who had been murdered served as a rallying point for afghan communists an estimated 10 000 to 30 000 persons gathered to hear stirring speeches by nur mohammed taraki and karmal shocked by this demonstration of communist unity daoud ordered the arrest of pdpa leaders but he reacted too slowly it took him a week to arrest taraki and amin was merely placed under house arrest according to later pdpa writings amin sent complete orders for the coup from his home while it was under armed guard using his family as messengers the army had been put on alert on april 26 because of a presumed anti islamic coup given daoud s repressive and suspicious mood officers known to have differed with daoud even those without pdpa ties or with only tenuous connections to the communists moved hastily to prevent their own downfall april coup on april 27 1978 a coup d état beginning with troop movements at the military base at kabul international airport gained ground slowly over the next twenty four hours as rebels battled units loyal to daoud in and around the capital daoud and most of his family were shot in the presidential palace the following day two hundred and thirty one years of royal and then republican rule by ahmad shah and his descendants had ended and the period of the communist democratic republic of afghanistan had began endofarticle doc doc

30 miles north of downtown los angeles california ssfl continues to operate today serving as a research facility for the boeing company the first commercial nuclear power producing reactor inside the united states was built at ssfl the reactor powered over 1 100 homes in the moorpark area of california for a short period of time ssfl however also became home to the first meltdown of a power producing reactor in the united states on july 26 1959 today all nuclear research and most rocket testing has been halted various research initiatives such as the development of the saturn rockets that powered the apollo missions the rockets that powered the vast ballistic missile arsenal of the united states during the cold war years and even a program to develop nuclear reactors for use in outer space were undertaken at the facility which still remains widely unknown to the public history founded in the mid 1940s ssfl was slated as a united states government facility dedicated to the development and testing of nuclear reactors powerful rockets like the delta ii and the systems that powered the apollo missions the location of ssfl was chosen for its remoteness in order to conduct work that was considered too dangerous to be performed in more densely populated areas in subsequent years however southern california s population mushroomed today more than 150 000 people live within 5 miles of the facility and at least half a million people live within 10 miles see boeing site environmental report for calendar year 2005 september 2006 p 5 22 at a size of 2 850 acres 11 km² ssfl is situated on top of the simi hills overlooking simi valley to the north chatsworth canoga park and the west hills areas of the san fernando valley a densly populated area on the northernmost border of los angeles city limits to the south the site is divided into four areas area i ii iii iv areas i through iii were used for rocket testing missile testing and munitions development area iv was used primarily for nuclear reactor experimentation and development star wars laser research also known as the strategic defense initiative was also conducted in area iv throughout the years approximately ten nuclear reactors operated at ssfl in addition to several critical facilities low power reactors a sodium burn pit in which sodium coated objects were burned in an open pit a plutonium fuel fabrication facility a uranium carbide fuel fabrication facility and purportedly the largest hot lab facility in the united states at the time a hot lab is a facility used for remotely cutting up irradiated nuclear fuel irradiated nuclear fuel from other atomic energy commission aec and department of energy doe facilities from around the country were shipped to ssfl to be decladed and examined the hot lab suffered a number of fires involving radioactive materials for example in 1957 a fire in the hot cell got out of control and massive contamination resulted see naa sr 1941 sodium graphite reactor quarterly progress report january march 1957 another radioactive fire occurred in 1971 involving combustible primary reactor coolant nak contaminated with mixed fission products see rockwell international nuclear operations at rockwell s santa susana field laboratory a factual perspective september 6 1991 at least four of the ten nuclear reactors suffered accidents the ae6 reactor experienced a release of fission gases in march of 1959 the sre experienced a power excursion and partial meltdown in july 1959 the snap8er in 1964 experienced damage to 80 of its fuel and the snap8dr in 1969 experienced similar damage to a third of its fuel see reactor accident sources below unfortunately the reactors located on the grounds of ssfl were considered experimental and therefore had no containment structures reactors and highly radioactive components were housed without the large concrete domes surrounding modern power reactors the most famous incident occurred on july 26 1959 on that summer day the sodium reactor experiment sre suffered a power excursion when power production from the reactor rose out of control with significant effort the reactor was shut down however a few hours later it was restarted without the cause of the incident having been determined the reactor continued to operate for several more weeks with high radiation readings and other signs of problems until it was shut down at the end of the month after a full shut down was completed the reactor operators discovered that a significant fraction of the fuel had suffered melting tetralin a coolant used for the pump seals had leaked into the sodium coolant of the reactor carbonaceous material formed blocking the coolant channels and preventing the sodium coolant from reaching the reactor core which in turn caused the fuel to overheat and melt approximately one third of the fuel experienced melting radioactive gases were released from the reactor into holding tanks and then bled into the atmosphere over a period of weeks the extent of the radioactive releases remains uncertain to this date but estimates put the amount from 260 to 459 times the amount of radiation that was released at the three mile island facility some monitors went off scale but few measurements of the sodium coolant were taken later the few measurements that were taken emerged to be contradictory however the ratios of volatile radionuclides found in the coolant suggested significant releases of radioactivity into the environment may have occurred the 1959 sre incident is the most well known accident to occur at the facility in 2006 the history channel did a piece on the sre accident see modern marvels engineering disasters 19 however the plutonium fuel fabrication facility and the hot laboratory which handled highly irradiated reactor fuel from much larger reactors shipped in from the aec doe nuclear complex possibly had more serious accidents however virtually nothing about their accident histories are publicly known the sodium burn pit an open air pit for cleaning sodium contaminated components was also contaminated when radioactively and chemically contaminated items were burned in it in contravention of safety requirements in an article in the ventura county star james palmer a former ssfl worker was interviewed the article notes that of the 27 men on palmer s crew 22 died of cancers on some nights palmer returned home from work and kissed his hello only to burn her lips with the chemicals he had breathed at work the report also noted that during their breaks palmer s crew would fish in one of three ponds the men would use a solution that was 90 percent hydrogen peroxide to neutralize the contamination sometimes the water was so polluted it bubbled the

october 30 2006 the ventura county star on december 11 2002 a top department of energy doe official mike lopez described the typical clean up procedures executed by field lab employees workers would dispose of barrels filled with highly toxic waste by shooting the barrels with shotguns so that they would explode and release their contents into the air this procedure survived until the mid 1990s when two employees were killed by a barrel that exploded after they shot it other spills and releases occurred over the decades of operation as well in 1989 a doe investigation found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination on the property widely publicized in the local press the revelations led to substantial concern among community members and elected officials resulting in a challenge to and subsequent shutdown of continued nuclear activity at the site and the filing of lawsuits cleanup commenced and the united states environmental protection agency epa was brought in at the request of local legislators to provide oversight in 2005 wildfires swept through northern los angeles county and parts of ventura county the fires consumed most of the dry brush throughout the simi hills where ssfl is located substantial fire damage was done to the facility since the fire allegations have emerged that vast quantities of on site contamination was burned up and released into the air most recently los angeles county firefighters who were assigned to ssfl during the fire have been sent for medical testing to see if any harmful doses were ingested or inhaled while protecting the facility while community members and firefighters have expressed concern about the amount of exposure boeing officials stand by their position that no contamination of the air resulted from the fire and that any contamination that may have been consumed by the fire was negligible california s department of toxic substances control also claims that no significant contamination occurred as a result of the fire although the field lab is under current criticism for violating almost 50 discharge permits state agencies have been silent on the issue recently lawyers disclosed to the california water resources control board that over 80 exceedances of boeing s discharge permits were found in the past year alone in january of 2006 the state water resources control board finally stepped in and refused some requests by boeing for even lighter standards also in october of 2005 a plaintiff in a suit against boeing criticized her attorneys who as she claimed accepted a 30 million dollar settlement with boeing without her approval the attorneys stand to collect 18 million or 60 of the settlement amount after their costs and fees are subtracted the plaintiff who disclosed the allegedly tainted deal is splitting the rest of the settlement with other plaintiffs and will only receive around 30 000 a far cry from the amount she will need for extensive future medical treatments for diseases that were linked to contamination from the ssfl facility in october of 2006 the santa susana field laboratory advisory panel made up of independent scientists and researchers from around the united states concluded that contamination at the facility resulted in 300 1 800 cancer deaths the report also concluded that the sre meltdown caused the release of more than 458 times the radiation

believe that ssfl remains a highly polluted site to this day widespread use of highly toxic chemicals to power the rocket tests and to clean rocket test stands after the testing as well as contamination that resulted from the considerable nuclear research is at the heart of such claims cleanup standards future use of the land ssfl is located on is also a source of much debate the site s current owners the boeing company have issued statements suggesting that the land may be sold for future unrestricted residential development without having cleaned the site up to environmental protection agency epa cleanup standards on august 2 2005 pratt whitney purchased rocketdyne from boeing but refused to acquire ssfl as part of the sale in 1989 doe found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination at the site and a cleanup program commenced in 1995 epa and doe announced that they had entered into a joint policy agreement to assure that all doe sites would be cleaned up to standards consistent with epa s comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla standards also known as superfund however in march 2003 doe reversed its position and announced that ssfl would not be cleaned up to epa superfund standards while doe simultaneously claimed compliance with the 1995 joint policy agreement the new plan included a cleanup of only 1 of the contaminated soil and the release of ssfl for unrestricted residential use in as little as ten years epa responded to this announcement by claiming that doe was not subject to epa regulation due to the fact that doe existed as a separate entity under the executive branch of the federal government and refused take steps to force doe adherence to the 1995 agreement in august 2003 the senate appropriations committee issued a report on energy and water appropriations urging doe to live up to its commitments in the 1995 joint policy and clean up ssfl to epa s cercla standards shortly thereafter doe responded to the senate claiming it was in fact consistent with both the joint policy and epa s cercla standards in december 2003 soon after doe s announcement that it was consistent with the 1995 agreement epa issued its own formal findings epa determined that the cleanup was not consistent with its cercla standards and that sufficient contamination would remain at levels that would be dangerously inappropriate for unrestricted residential and that the only safe use under doe s revised cleanup standards would be restricted day hikes with limitations on picnicking critics point out that if the doe boeing cleanup plan was followed through and the site was released for unrestricted residential use the property would likely become a superfund site subject to epa standards after the sale the site would no longer be a doe facility and thus the exemption from cercla standards would no longer be in effect the end result being that the site would only be brought into compliance with cercla cleanup standards after boeing has sold the property relieving the company of any burden of cleanup costs the costs would likely be passed on to taxpayers and not those responsible for the actual contamination this is merely critical analysis however and it remains unclear as to what cleanup standards doe and boeing will end up setting for themselves community involvement every quarter simi valley hosts workgroup meetings regarding the cleanup of ssfl that is open to the public attendence and comment the workgroup consists of representatives from the california department of toxic substances control and the u s epa public policy organizations such as committee to bridge the gap also send representatives as part of the work group other organizations and private companies also attend as part of the workgroup depending on the topic pending the meeting is moderated by the epa doe and boeing are also invited to the workgroup meetings

 id=8833112 title albert morris nonfiltered 482 processed 478 dbindex 450485 albert morris was born on 13th august 1886 in bridgetown south australia faced with the depression in the south australia of the late 1880s morris s father sought work in the new mines of the barrier ranges and moved his family to broken hill to live morris spent much of his life in broken hill early in life albert developed a keen interest in plant life it is possible that a serious injury to his foot in his early childhood which prevented morris from taking part in the bustle of childhood activity contributed to his independence and self containment and to an increasing interest in botany by the time he was undertaking technical school studies in metallurgy and assaying morris had developed a small garden and nursery and contributed to the cost of his fees by selling plants pepper trees that he had grown when he qualified morris took up work on the central mine at broken hill eventually becoming chief assayer for the mine morris was married at broken hill on 13 april 1909 to ellen margaret sayce a dressmaker she was a forceful personality and a staunch member of the society of friends in 1918 morris also became a quaker after an anglican upbringing they built a tiny cottage in cornish street railway town a suburb of broken hill this was an area most exposed to soil erosion and drifting sand trees had been cut for fuel and years of overstocking and the rabbit plague had denuded the land broken hill was plagued by drifting sand and dust which in summer became major dust storms making work and domestic life difficult over some sixty years of settlement the landscape around the barrier ranges had progressively been denuded by pastoral activity by exotic animals such as rabbits and feral goats by mining and its residues and by the presence of a vast settlement of people and their animals as early as 1908 newspaper comments indicated that the sheet erosion around broken hill had already begun morris described the degraded landscape in these terms the extending country stretched for miles without a vestige of any green thing and each stone or old tin had a streamer of sand tailing out from it the fences were piled high with sand inside and out and it looked as if the intended railway lines would just be buried every dusty day which was every windy day several failures at establishing a barrier to the wind and sand in his garden inspired morris to experiment with plants that might be grown in arid regions in this work he was assisted by edwin ashby a fellow quaker and adelaide naturalist who had developed a system of watering to optimise survival of plantings in arid regions he continued his work of propagation purchasing adjoining land so he could expand his nursery and garden morris also started to make field trips into the country around broken hill studying and collecting specimens of the local flora he made a collection of about 8000 specimens from broken hill and western new south wales which was donated to the waite institute in south australia he was noted for his generosity and hospitality to fellow naturalists and others working at broken hill among those he helped was the noted botanist and writer thistle harris in 1920 with w d k mcgillivray he helped establish the field naturalists club and remained its secretary until his death in 1939 one of the members of the field naturalists was maurice mawby a junior member who was a great supporter of morris s work and who later managed the zinc corporation mine at broken hill morris became widely recognised for his work and contributions of plants to residents and civic bodies in broken hill and for his firm belief in the possibility of re establishing vegetation around the city while he trained and worked as an assayer at the central mine it was as a botanist and conservationist that he is best remembered his enduring legacy at broken hill was the green belt of revegetation and regeneration around the city that he conceived and worked to establish in 1936 changes in the management of the zinc corporation resulted in the appointment of a j keast as manager of the mine keast along with w s robinson the managing director of the zinc corporation was keen to improve working and living conditions for miners at broken hill they saw the need to control the dust and sand which continually moved about the mining area mawby introduced morris to keast morris who advised him that he could certainly provide the answer to the problem of the dust that the company wished to solve for it was something he had advocated for many years planting indigenous species that would check the wind and control the soil using strategically placed barriers to shield plants from the winds and fencing to exclude stock and rabbits based on his experience and consulting with keast in 1936 he conceived an initial plantation which the company established at freemans shaft though still working as an assayer for the central mine a rival mining company morris provided the honorary advice of his expertise and helped with organising the collection of seedlings for this planting this first green area eventually became known as albert morris park other plantings followed the most significant of which was an ambitious plan that morris had long advocated to enclose and revegetate the common land on the city s boundary such a project would ultimately provide a green belt of vegetation around broken hill in this work keast persuaded the other main mining companies on the field to participate while work on fencing this area began in 1936 it was not completed until 1938 and thus morris did not see the fruits of this plan he died early in january 1939 shortly after being

 id=1458984 title hydramatic nonfiltered 483 processed 479 dbindex 450486 hydramatic also known as hydra matic was an automatic transmission developed by general motors s oldsmobile division introduced for the 1940 model year the hydramatic was the first fully automatic mass produced transmission developed for passenger automobile use history during the 1930s various automakers sought methods of reducing or eliminating the necessity of shifting gears at the time synchromesh gears were still a novelty and confined to the higher gears in nearly all cases and shifting a manual gearbox required more care and skill than most drivers cared to exert gm had previously experimented with the automatic safety transmission a project initiated at cadillac division in 1934 and later developed by buick and oldsmobile oldsmobile offered the ast from 1937 to 1939 buick which felt the results uninspiring offered it only in 1938 the ast was a semi automatic transmission using planetary gears and a conventional friction clutch unsatisfied with the automatic safety transmission oldsmobile launched a new program headed by engineer earl thompson to combine hydraulic operation of a planetary gearbox which would allow much shifting to be automated with a fluid coupling instead of a friction clutch eliminating the need for de clutching the transmission would have four forward speeds plus reverse providing a broad range of torque multiplication it incorporated a parking pawl when the selector was placed in reverse with the engine off although there was no separate park position the result dubbed hydra matic drive went into production in may 1939 for the 1940 model year the first oldsmobiles so equipped were shipped in october 1939 advertising proclaimed it the greatest advance since the self starter in 1940 the hydra matic added 57 dollars to the car s price rising to 100 dollars for 1941 in 1941 it also became an option on cadillacs for 125 dollars almost 200 000 had been sold by the time passenger car production was halted for wartime production in february 1942 during the war the hydramatic mated to a cadillac v8 engine was used in a variety of military vehicles including the m5 stuart tank and the m24 chaffee light tank the extensive wartime service greatly improved the postwar engineering of the transmission which was subsequently advertised as battle tested starting in 1948 hydramatic became optional for pontiacs although buick and chevrolet chose to develop their own automatic transmissions one million hydramatics had been sold by 1949 in the early 1950s various manufacturers that did not have the resources to develop an automatic bought hydra matics from gm users included 1950 1956 hudson 1950 1956 nash 1951 frazer nash 1951 1954 kaiser 1954 1955 willys 1950 1954 lincoln in 1952 rolls royce acquired a license to produce the hydra matic under license for rolls royce and bentley automobiles it continued production through 1967 the hydramatic underwent several revisions through 1955 before being replaced by the substantially redesigned controlled coupling hydramatic also called jetaway in 1956 the new transmission incorporated a secondary fluid coupling and a pair of sprag clutches in place of the former friction clutch and brake bands shifting in part by alternately draining and filling the secondary coupling it allowed the driver to hold the transmission in low or in third gear until the maximum allowable upshift points for improved performance in traffic or in mountain driving and incorporated a separate park position the new transmission was substantially smoother than the original but also more complex and expensive to produce so in the early 1960s it was phased out in favor of the lighter roto hydramatic torque converter automatic and ultimately the turbo hydramatic the original hydramatic continued to be used in light trucks and other commercial vehicles well into the 1960 s it was subsequently replaced in that role by the turbo hydramatic whose simplified design was much less costly to manufacture despite the name the turbo hydramatic thm was not mechanically related in any way to the original hydramatic the hydramatic was a complex design that was expensive to mass produce nevertheless despite some early teething problems it was fairly reliable and was so rugged that it was widely used in drag racing in the 1960 s it was not as smooth as some competitors notably buick s dynaflow the ultimate in slip n slide but it also sacrificed less performance it paved the way for the widespread acceptance of automatic shifting hydramatic is now a trade name for gm s automatic transmission division which produces a variety of later transmissions the most notable of which is the turbo hydramatic from the 1960s to the 1990s design the hydramatic used a two element fluid coupling not a torque converter which has at least three elements the pump turbine and stator and three planetary gearsets providing four forward speeds plus reverse standard ratios for the original hydra matic were 3 82 1 2 63 1 1 45 1 and 1 00 1 in automotive applications and 4 08 1 2 63 1 1 55 1 and 1 00 1 in light truck and other commercial applications the jetaway hydramatic used 3 96 1 2 55 1 1 55 1 and 1 00 1 a unique feature of the hydramatic design was the manner in which the fluid coupling was interposed in the power flow in modern automatics all engine power passes through the torque converter and then on to the gear train unless the converter includes a clutch to lock the turbine to the pump some slippage will always occur which can have a significant negative effect on efficiency and fuel economy this was not the case with the hydramatic in first gear power flow was through the forward planetary gear assembly either 1 45 1 or 1 55 1 reduction depending on the model then the fluid coupling followed by the rear gear assembly 2 63 1 reduction and through the reverse gear assembly normally locked to the output shaft that is the input torus of the fluid coupling ran at a lower speed than the engine due to the reduction of the forward gear assembly this produced an exceptionally smooth startup because of the relatively large amount of slippage initially produced in the fluid coupling this slippage quickly diminished as engine rpm increased when the transmission upshifted to second gear the forward gear assembly locked and the input torus now ran at engine speed this had the desirable effect of tightening the coupling and reducing slippage but unfortunately also produced a somewhat abrupt shift it wasn t at all uncommon for the vehicle to lurch forward during the 1 2 shift especially when the throttle was wide open upon shifting to third the forward gear assembly went back into reduction and the rear gear assembly locked due to the manner in which the rear gear assembly was arranged the coupling went from handling 100 percent of the engine torque to about 40 percent with the balance being handled solely by the gear train this greatly reduced slippage which fact was audible by the substantial reduction that occurred in engine rpm when the shift occurred the shift from third to fourth gear locked the forward gear assembly producing 1 00 1 transmission the fluid coupling now only handled about 25 percent of the engine torque reducing slippage to a negligible amount the result was a remarkably efficient level of power transfer at highway speeds something that torque converter equipped automatics could not achieve without the benefit of a converter clutch many hydramatics did not execute the 2 3 shift very well as the shift involved the simultaneous operation of two bands and two clutches accurate coordination of these components was difficult to achieve even in new transmissions as the transmission s seals and other elastomers aged the hydraulic control characteristics changed and the 2 3 shift would either cause a momentary flare runup in engine speed or tie up a short period where the transmission is actually in two gears at the same time the latter often contributing to failure of the front band use in pop culture in the 1978 musical grease danny zuko played by john travolta describes his beloved hot rod as automatic systematic and hydra matic why it s greased lightning trivia the hydramatic not the jetaway version did not have a separate park position as found in modern automatic transmissions the driver had to shut off the engine and then place the transmission in reverse in order to lock the driveline to prevent the car from moving the first version of the hydramatic used a mechanical pawl to lock the planet carrier of the reverse gearset when the driver wished to back the vehicle this arrangement did not work well in practice and was replaced with a cone clutch the all cast iron hydramatic was the heaviest automatic transmission ever produced for automobiles external links general motors

concentrating on the teams encountered by the deimon devil bats deimon devil bats for full article see deimon devil bats eyeshield 21 koigahama cupids logo cupid team colours crimson and pink the cupids are a very weak team that is well known for all of their team members having girlfriends and bringing them to the games which aren t very many since they usually lose and get eliminated within the first or second matches the quarterback has an annoying habit of teasing the opposing side by stating that his team has at least ten girls cheering for them while suggesting that his opponents come from an all boys school it was against this team that eyeshield 21 made his debut by scoring a comeback touchdown victory the quarterback s girlfriend is rather stupid and persists in thinking that her boyfriend is a rugby player even though he has repeatedly told her that it s american football eventually he just gave up the cupids set the worst record in the kanto tournament losing to the seibu wild gunmans 10 125 as a result they surrendered during the 3rd quarter and never finished the game the quarterback and his girlfriend have made appearances in the crowd at several of deimon s games including the match with taiyo oujouu white knights j howaito naitsu mascot knight with lance on horse helmet logo blue shield with a white crucifix team colours white and blue akin to the indianapolis colts away kit jerseys feature a lightning bolt across each shoulder notes oujouu private senior high school resembles the notre dame cathedral to indicate that the school has a long proud american football tradition like the university of notre dame in the united states their team s chant is glory on the kingdom the team coach is gunpei shouji a man who played football with doburoku when they were young a ponytailed girl named koharu wakana is the team manager the team is based on the old football maxim offense wins games but defense wins championships if the opponent can be prevented from scoring then only one point is needed to win this is the direct opposite of the deimon devil bats in which ultimate offense is the best strategy hiruma if we can score 100 points to their 99 points the number of points oujouu scored on their first game against deimon then one point is all we need to win like zokugaku oujouu also has a university school whose football team are the silver knights currently their players consist of the legendary golden generation known as the pinnacle of the ultimate defense and who came the closest to defeat the unstoppable shinryuji nagas during their time prior to deimon doing so this football season seijuro shin seiy naoya goumoto shin seij r the ace linebacker of the oujouu white knights american football team and sena kobayakawa s main rival shin is a silent seemingly unsociable person despite this his friends include his teammates haruto sakuraba and makoto otawara after the oujouu s coach shoji gunpei noticed his talent when he first tried out for the oujouu american football team with sakuraba he told the seniors to make sure shin never gets recruited by any other club than the american football club shin is the fastest and strongest linebacker in all of japan his signature move is the spear tackle a powerful one arm thrust that can stop any opponent much more honourable than a spear in a real game where the tackling player leads with his helmet he is one of the few characters who figured out that sena was eyeshield 21 right away after finding out sena s secret identity he tells him he ll be waiting for him in the finals he does consider eyeshield 21 as a formidable opponent as he admitted during the interview before the kantou elimination rounds this is due to the fact that sena is able to achieve the legendary speed of light pace 40 yards in 4 2 seconds and was the one person who actually beat him and his spear tackle outright with pure speed no cuts moves etc it was through this experience that shin was driven to improve on his running as well as his strength he s very good at analyzing a person s moves and how to react accordingly to stop him shin somewhat resembles kenshiro from fist of the north star which is used humorously in the manga to show sena s fear of shin as a delusion it s suggested that delusion shin can probably use hokuto shinken as well shin s mind is constantly on his physical conditioning while the devil bats are celebrating their first victories in the fall tournament they meet up with the white knights part way and the two teams go to eat together at a buffet restaurant even then shin uses the hoarding on the restaurant which is a model of a bull s head horns and all to exercise on by doing push ups and one handed chin ups on shin was based on legendary martial artist and actor bruce lee his facial features seem to confirm this he is always serious when it comes to his training but is at an absolute loss when it comes to technology he will break any kind of device within one minute of being handed it since he has no idea of how the device works so far he s broken a camcorder a gps device and later on a laptop in a jump advertisement for the eyeshield 21 nintendo ds game shin accidentally breaks the ds he was playing with he is also so absorbed in american football and training to the point that when he was asked what kind of girls he likes he replied with the requirements to become the team manager during the summer before the fall kantou tournament he trains at mt fuji to perfect the ballista technique he has yet to show it in the manga or anime at end of the fall tournament he is voted as the mvp most valuable player and prepares to face off against eyeshield 21 in the kantou tournament in the anime shin does go up against sena and his new devil bat ghost maneuver early on initially he was shocked that his traditional one arm spear tackle was useless against the ghost sena succeeded in passing him twice this was a rare moment in which he doubted his own ability this led him to develop the twin spear technique using both arms to stop eyeshield 21 later on he witnesses sena develop the devil bat tornado causing him to realize that his rival was fast evolving he vowed to train even harder for when he and eyeshield 21 would meet in the final showdown unfortunately unless there is a major twist in the story this is fated not to happen oujouu and deimon were drawn in the same half of the kantou tournament and providing they win their quarter final matchups would meet in the semi finals prior to the start of their game against the sado strong golems in the quarterfinals shin approaches rikku of the seibu wild gunmen telling him of a combination of the spear tackle with his rodeo drive creating a new technique called the trident tackle used to crush sado easily the technique is actually preparation for the semi final opponent sena and the devil bats at present shin is preparing for the semifinal game with deimon with the possibility of a perfected ballista and his own trident tackle combined with his belief that all of deimon s tricks have been revealed against shinryuji he has total confidence in both oujou defeating the devil bats and his final domination of sena in chapter 210 his theory seemed set to be put to the test as both players collide during deimon s opening drive however this turned out not to be the case as his fellow teammate ikari tackled eyeshield first however as deimon s first drive continues shin immediately realized that the devil bats had a distinct advantage over oujou in terms of stamina with the devil bats members playing both offense and defense and using seibu s shotgun strategy they went with 100 effort regardless of risk while the knights only used 99 he then persuades sakuruba to join him on defense as he knows that only he could match raimon in terms of catching though the knights were able to stop the devil bats from scoring the first touchdown of the game deimon still took the lead with a field goal shin recognized the power and ability of musashi s kicking leg but was unable to deflect the ball due to being blocked by sena with the score 0 3 in deimon s favor shin now comes to play on offense using the ballista tactic the white knights take the lead 6 3 with a touchdown by sakaruba but a failed extra kick attempt realizing that deimon could still score with field goals shin and his team must prevent the devil bats from scoring any touchdowns when the devil bats reclaim the ball shin surprises everyone by revealing his greatest secret he has finally reached the speed of light pace that only sena himself had reached using the power of his new found speed and the trident tackle he both catches up and stops sena s rushing attempt saying he has finally proven once and for all that he is the better player at this time sena has not found a means to either avoid or surpass shin proving that the oujou player has ultimately become the perfect player of the tournament 40 yard dash 4 37 seconds beginning 4 36 seconds later 4 35 seconds more recently speed of light pace 4 2 seconds chp 217 bench press 140 kg newer chapters 180 kg position middle linebacker jersey 40 2nd year student 11th grade techniques strategies spear tackle shin uses a one arm thrust aimed at his opponent s midsection which is usually enough to stop him in his tracks it can stop sena s normal running tactics panther s zero gravity run and riku s rodeo drive but it proves useless in the anime against the devil bat ghost twin spear tackle by using both arms in the thrust shin is able to counter the devil bat ghost shin also uses this on other players to stop them and make them fumble as seen in the rematch against the sankaku punks whether it can overcome the devil bat tornado is yet unknown trident tackle first seen in the 203rd down in order to counter sena s light speed running shin asked riku sena s childhood friend now playing for the seibu wild gunmans on how to do his rodeo drive by combining this method along with his spear tackle shin is able to suddenly shoot forward at 120 of his maximum speed during the instant he charges his opponent this also delivers a more powerful thrust it has proven effective against sena s devil light hurricane move by chapter 218 ballista in chapter 206 it was revealed that the ballista is a formation that involves putting shin into offense this was information that takami the knights quarterback offered up freely when hiruma gatecrashed the oujouu festival quiz when it comes to the first oujouu drive of their game against deimon takami is so confident of the formation s success that he actually tells the bats which way the play will go and he doesn t bluff them either the nature of the ballista is to use a spear shin s trademark move to open up a hole for the ball carrier to get through and shin s power is such that he actually lifts up kurita whether shin is using his spear or trident tackles is unclear yet but it is likely to be just the spear for the moment the game is still in the first quarter when the game comes down to the clutch that ll be when he will pull out a trident based ballista haruto sakuraba seiy mamoru miyano sakuraba haruto a typical good looking pop idol he has a cd single due to recording technology despite the fact that he can t sing he works in an advertising company called jari productions when he was young he used to watch sports all the time and dreamed of becoming a professional athlete in high school he managed to enter the team as a wide receiver after drawing much attention from the seniors due to his height however the coach shoji was more interested in shin shin soon surpassed sakuraba becoming the ace of the team sakuraba felt a little envious of shin s success and achievements and was disappointed with himself for not being able to soar to greater heights he eventually became less interested in training and sports in general one day miracle ito of jari productions noticed him and decided that he would be a good model feeling wanted and pleased to be in the spotlight for once sakaruba agreed to work for him now he is constantly misunderstood because of his popularity people mistake him for the genius of the oujou team and disregard the true ace shin in fact his football skills are mediocre at best especially his catching ability sakuraba always felt pressured to do well and to live up to assumptions people made about him an accident in the oujou vs deimon game changed it all though sena as eyeshield 21 accidentally tackled sakuraba while running injuring him the reason that sakuraba was hit even though he was not playing at that time was that he ran onto the field to grab a card that miracle ito told him to wear as advertisement in the hospital after meeting sena monta and his die hard fan torakichi who admires sakuraba for his catch in the game against deimon the year before he finally decides to stop being pessimistic and to succeed just as shin has done just before the fall tournament started he decided to quit working with jari productions and focus on american football with the help of his friends after he heard takami complimenting him and how he had waited for a friend like sakuraba someone like him who understood his predicaments before the opening ceremony he cut his hair in a crew cut style and started growing a goatee to show his renewed vigor in pursuing success in american football much to the dismay of miracle ito who had depended on sakuraba s good looks to make money this has turned out probably for the best as if ito had seen sakuraba at the end of 207th down he would have had a coronary on the spot due to ootawara s usual thickheaded nature he and sakuraba lost the quiz game that oujouu ran as part of its autumn festival by a mile which meant they had to do a forfeit dress up in maid costumes ootawara looked ridiculous no change there but sakuraba was a sight to behold his skills as a wide receiver have rapidly improved and sakuraba can now be considered a real ace he was also complimented by shouji as the player with the strongest heart in oujou and by unsui as one of the big four in the wide receiver battle along with ikky monta and tetsuma as of now sakuruba joins shin on defense to challenge monta of the devil bats he does manage to stop monta from receiving the ball and on oujouu s first drive scored for the white knights making it 6 3 it is interesting to note that the high school league that is featured in eyeshield 21 only requires one foot to land in bounds for a caught pass to count instead of both feet in the pros sakuraba was way over the touchline though not on the ground when he caught takami s pass a deliberate ploy by the oujou passer as he knew nobody could reach that far but his intended target and sakuraba still managed to get a foot in bounds once he caught the pass however it seems that sena may have figured out a way to stop the everest pass whether he was serious when he said kurita should guard sakuraba remains to be seen 40 yard dash 5 0 seconds 4 92 seconds in volume 11 bench press

they dominated the rematch and won 82 0 in the fall tournament techniques strategies everest pass sakaurba s height plays to his advantage as a receiver especially since oujou s quarterback ichiro takami is also tall he launches the ball at a high angle over the field in which sakaurba leaps up to catch it the pass is at such a great height that the opposing team can do little about it even if they know where it will land it s simply too high to intercept ichiro takami takami ichir when ichiro takami entered the oujou white knights his dream was to become a quarterback however a childhood leg injury left him unable to run as quickly as otawara after the coach told him he could not play due to this drawback he decided to take on more training and study calculations for passing to other players finally after his fourth year on the team he officially became the team s quarterback for the kanto tournament he is analytical and has some ability in reading the movements and strategies of opposing teams his passes are done with precision and accuracy though they are not on the same level as hiruma s or kid s it has been recently revealed that he had been waiting for someone like sakuraba to be his wide receiver since both of them are tall and are able to use that fact to compensate for their shortcomings ie takami s slow running and sakuraba s lack of drive and feelings of inadequacy together they develop the everest pass with the rematch between deimon and oujou approaching he has worked with the team to perfect the ballista using it in match against the former golden generation however hiruma is trying to find a way around it even sabotaging a game show at the oujou school festival to get answers from him while shin stepped in to save him at the last minute takami still believes the ballista is what makes oujou undefeatable in the tournament what takami doesn t know is that hiruma had already read over the summary of the ballista tactic and that he and doburoku are planning something in preparation for the game against oujou now with the score 6 3 in favor of the white knights takami realizes that he d have to match hiruma in terms of drive and mind games if he hopes to win 40 yard dash 5 7 seconds bench press 85 kg position quarterback jersey 3 3rd year student grade 12 techniques strategies everest pass see sakuraba s entry ballista see shin s entry takami is like hiruma a cunning player in 215th down he is described as using black tactics while pushing up glasses a reference to one piece s captain kuro he seems to tell the bats about which way the play will go but all he s really saying is which way the ballista will go the ball doesn t necessarily go the same this is revealed with the second ballista play when takami says the ballista will be released to the right conning the bats defense into following the call while takami sets ready for a pass to sakuraba on the left hiruma figures it out just as the knights passer is letting fly with an everest pass to sakuraba who is being covered by the diminutive monta whom hiruma calls out to monta is unable to stop sakaruba but hiruma almost manages to push the oujouu receiver out of bounds makoto ootawara seiy kenji nomura a very large lineman for the white knights with huge frame muscles and ego ootawara is a very loud and brash person who always says what s on his mind in spite of the fact there s not much up there to begin with he has a flatulence problem he farts a lot and he makes no effort to hide it ootawara doesn t even notice when his pants fall off usually with many spectators present even when takami ichirou oujouu s quarterback tells him about it he doesn t even feel embarrassed and seems to have difficulty telling the difference between the japanese katakana he and the number 7 furthermore he has a bad habit of picking his nose in front of people as shouji the white knight s coach puts it ootawara is plain stupid and even he admits it freely however ootawara can be very insightful which genuinely shocks just about everyone however that is also his strength since his overall power and simplistic way of doing things makes him perfect for the line both on offense and defense when he s really motivated he could rip apart two opposing rookies in spite of how crude he can be he s a nice guy at heart though he is the epitome of the dumb jock always competing with kurita ootawara usually ends up on the short end of the stick thanks to kurita s drive during the game with the sado strong golems it was revealed that he too has been training to increase his speed in order to use his strength and bulk more effectively though it took shouji a week to explain the principle to him ootawara is now able to smash through the stoutest of opponents like a battering ram like shin is with sena ootawara is looking forward to his rematch against kurita who had defeated him in a personal contest of strength during the spring tournament 40 yard dash 5

team plays mostly on the defensive line with ootawara ikari is kept chained up because irrational behavior he has absolutely no respect toward the graduated golden generation members since he never played with them managed to get himself ejected from his first game against the sankaku punks by attacking their coach who had just insulted sakuraba from what is shown on the manga he still hasn t played a single down never mind a game because of his anger problems however he does have great respect for shouji white knights coach during the celebration party after the white knights first victories in the kantou tournament he gets very competitive against kurita and the devil bats after seeing him eat 20 servings in almost no time at all this makes him order 30 servings on the spot the two teams get involved in an eating contest in which they had to consume 500 servings each the losers had to foot the bill the white knights lost but luckily it was an all you can eat buffet ikari finally gets to play in the game between oujou and deimon shin has brought forth the idea that the knights throw everything they ve got at the bats including this nutter prior to this game he finally broke free of his chains being allowed to play alongside the other white knights in their climactic showdown indeed on the very first play of the oujouu deimon game in which sena s running the opening kickoff back ikari pre empts shin s trident tackle with a tackle of his own resembling kenshiro s fighting style specifically the hokuto hyaku retsu ken ironically as some believe that shin himself was based on the fist of the north star hero however when the play was blown dead ikari wasn t done he charged headlong for sena again to finish him off had it not been for juumonji the bats lineman and the huh huh bros leader blocking him sena would have been history the power in ikari s blocked attack ignited a memory in juumonji he knew daigo ikari previously by a different moniker prison chain ikari back in his middle school days ikari was famous as a vicious individual he wore a thick chain over his shoulder and was so intimidating nobody would even dare approach him ikari claimed at this point that he never once provoked a fight in his four years at oujouu which turned out to be totally false he never did anything else he spent more time suspended from school than anything else but when he heard about oujouu s golden generation heading to oujouu university and a side comment about the white knights turning into a poor team he joined the side as previously stated his white hot temper has meant he s not played a single down until the deimon oujouu semifinal and now he s in the lineup he can finally show what he can do and what a devastating effect he has in the first play from scrimmage he brushed juumonji aside after his north star style attack burst through to hiruma and slammed him into the turf it looked as if the devil bat quarterback had been sacked but hiruma did not have the ball when he was tackled he had already seen ikari attacking and threw a short pass resulting in a 1 yard gain position lineman jersey number 66 ikari shares the same jersey

doburoku together they were known at the twin japanese blades unlike his former teammate shouji had avoided seriously injuring himself during the death march training he s a harsh but fair coach and he firmly believes that victory can only be achieved though ultimate defense he had immediately recognized shin s potential and had instructed the upper classmen of the team to make certain that shin was not recruited by any other clubs at present he believes that the current team of white knights is the strongest ever though he and doburoku are now on opposite sides of the field and will inevitably face each other as rivals both still hold great respect toward one another the two meet on the field prior to the game in which their teams will face each other in the semi finals and both

above using dirty tactics to win the team was disqualified from the spring tournament when some of the players beat up the referee like the chameleon zokugaku s philosophy is to adapt in order to win they specialize in targeting an opponent s weakness in either past strategies or team members however they have a problem whenever the opposing team does something that they don t expect their leader accepts a challenge from deimon where 5 million yen goes to the victor of their match the game against the devil bats ends in a 28 48 loss for them when deimon defeats zokugaku the team believes that hiruma was joking about the money until hiruma busts out numerous guns and grenades strapped to his body in response to rui s unsheathing of his butterfly knife after all sena once said in response to an anecdote about rui s constant possession of a butterfly knife we know someone who always carries firearms the chameleons are forced to become his slaves to pay off their debt to him otherwise hiruma would have disassembled their motorcycles and sell the parts for money they help the hah brothers to train and learn a new technique called rascal killing sometimes known as delinquent deathblow or scumbag scuffle in the english manga it s called the juvenile deliquent murder method the team was later released from their debt when the devil bats went to america hiruma wanted them to train for the fall tournament in the anime the devil bats and chameleons have a practice scrimmage just before the second matches of the fall tournament the team from zokugaku showed a better performance than before but they still lost 28 30 due to the addition of deimon s new tight end afterwards they were forced to carry their motorcycles home by their manager trainer habashira rui the leader of the zokugaku team basically he is a punk s punk leading his team like it was a street gang which in fact it is not short on skill habashira s long arms make him a good linebacker because he can intercept passes and stop runs though he s not on the same level as shin habashira s trash talking of shin is what motivates sena in their game however he does show a more serious side after his team is defeated by the kyoshin poseidon team hiruma noted that only habashira tried his hardest to win at this point the zokugaku linebacker begged hiruma to tell him why when the two of them were so much alike both using force to rule their teams his team lost heart while the devil bats fought on during the start of the 2nd half of the game between the devil bats and the nagas he and tsuyumine

habashira s afraid of her she is also an expert of surprise attacks and interrogates the team members sereverely to strengthen them tsuyumine is considered as a beauty but because of her brutal and torturous personality she is more feared than admired while it was left unclear by the creators if tsuyumine and habashira are dating it was said that the two are good companions who share a great

coloured the engrish name of wild gunmans has been corrected to wild gunmen in the viz comms translation like deimon seibu is highly focused on offense with passing being the major component though the run with riku has been recently added this is one bizarre team but the second best team in the spring kantou tournament their coach is an old japanese man who acts like a real cowboy the cheerleaders are japanese girls who wear sexy cowgirl dress even real guns their captain is the lineman buffalo ushijima the most active team ever seen in eyeshield 21 manga during spring break they train in houston texas once tetsuma kid and their coach team up with sena mamori monta and hiruma to become devil gunmen in a beach football tournament as the seibu coach didn t want the prize a bull to be eaten by anyone he also wanted it for their ranch the teams chant is gun gun that will do shien mushanokoji aka kid kid is a nickname his real name is shien which hiruma mentions after deimon s sports day he is a quarterback and has one of the fastest pass speeds in japan possibly in the world kid and tetsuma make up one of the strongest quarterback wide receiver combinations in japan by high school standards like the legendary joe montana jerry rice combination although to a lesser extent kid specializes in quick draw shooting where he throws the ball as soon as he receives it from the center to tetsuma seibu s wide receiver this kind of quick release is more akin to miami s hall of fame passer dan marino his personality is very laid back however whenever he gets the feeling that things go too well he always predicts that something bad will happen which usually does such as in the spring tournament when they were ahead of the oujou white knights during the first half tetsuma drank too much water and could not participate in the second half his quote is something bad has to happen after something so good recently the manga has shown that kid is the son of an olympic class pistol shooter which might account for his inhuman accuracy he s also known tetsuma since they were kids accounting for how in sync they appear to be originally kid couldn t throw and tetsuma couldn t catch but they practiced all the time as kids and got better position quarterback jersey 7 a great sharpshooter like hiruma he s half american and half japanese the name kid is derived from the name of a famous cowboy billy the kid in america he once teamed up with hiruma in the beach football match and used a special technique named super quarterback tag their tosses were so fast that everyone assumed that they were using the too tattoos dancing flea technique techniques strategies quick draw pass kid is a specialist with short fast passes as soon as he gets the ball the time it takes for him to raise and pass the ball is 0 15 seconds as opposed to a normal quarterback s speed of 0 5 seconds catching him in a blitz is near impossible his throwing technique is odd as well as opposed to releasing the ball from over his throwing shoulder kid throws the ball from in front on himself using both hands to generate an incredibly fast spiral in a similar fashion to pass training machines that wide receivers use shotgun a strategy that relies totally on passing instead of having one or two receivers ready to catch passes the number is increased to four or more the receivers spread out like buckshot pellets once the ball is snapped this increases the number of directions in which the kid can pass the ball even linebackers like shin find it difficult to cover so many receivers at once j tetsuma a fast and quiet guy he has a habit of following orders to the letter and that can lead to disaster it is very important to give him specific instructions and to watch him carefully otherwise he will follow any general directions to the extreme for example the coach once said to him go run a bit so he kept running for 3 days and 3 nights until he collapsed from hunger another time was when kid told him to wake him up after 3 hours while riding on a bus kid got off the bus earlier but tetsuma still waited 3 hours then burst out of the back window of the bus to go look for kid so he could wake him up whenever kid calls a pass route he dashes and uses it as followed no questions asked this makes him perfect for his position as a wide receiver since the kid doesn t even have to look for him in order to pass in spite of his seemingly robotic demeanor tetsuma is a nice person who has been friends with kid since they were in middle school one important note is that after the game with deimon tetsuma invokes a penalty by striking monta when he was about to attack the referee for ruling in favor of seibu this was actually done to save monta from destroying the devil bats chances of playing for third place in the tournament as a result tetsuma was banned from playing in the finals of the fall tournament against oujou without him the gunmen lost out to the white knights again but monta vows to meet up with tetsuma again during the kantou elimination tournament position wide receiver jersey 15 40 yard dash 5 0 seconds bench press 115 kg his name also means iron horse in america they use this nickname for the steam engine train in the old west this gives meaning to the pass routes he is ordered to follow which likens him to a train that cannot be altered from the track it runs he will bowl over anyone who gets in the way on the tracks in the game against deimon however monta does manage to upset his route and cause him to fumble in a match against the oujou white knights he was the cause of a huge lead 20 7 but because he drank too much water during half time he cannot continue as he has to go to the toilet the entire time causing his team to lose 20 21 techniques strategies pass routes tetsuma has drilled all known pass routes into his head and can run them like a conditioned reflex all he needs is to hear the route called out by kid and he ll perfectly execute the movement nothing can disrupt him when he runs his routes although monta has made him fumble once riku kaitani an extremely fast grey haired boy and happens to be the one who taught sena how to run when riku was in elementary school he saw sena being bullied and he used his speed to save him after that riku taught sena that if he could run fast he would never be bullied again sadly sena used his speed to be a gopher though it s ironic that being a gopher is what helped build up his speed riku soon left sena s school because his family needed to move but he and sena met again in chapter 127 like shin he was able to quickly deduce sena s identity as eyeshield 21 when his team went up against the white knights riku proved to be no match against shin and was unable to get by him once during the kantou tournament riku faced off against ga when he was about to beat up possibly kill a fan who had insulted banba and anyone else who was in the way fortunately the incident ended without any bloodshed after the seibu gunmen devastate the misaki wolves with a score of 82 14 they now prepare to face off against the hakushuu dinosaurs in the semi finals before the match between the strong golems and the white knights shin approached riku and asked him for the secret of the rodeo drive initially he refused thinking that shin had already defeated him during the tokyo fall tournament and that he didn t need such a technique however after learning that shin was going to use it in a method against sena riku agreed to show him thinking that eyeshield 21 might be the one to beat him position running back safety jersey 29 sena s top speed for a 40 yard dash is 4 2 seconds while riku s is 4 5 however riku can run at his top speed for long periods of time while sena s normal speed during a match is 4 5 seconds making them roughly the same in terms of speed in a real game techniques strategies rodeo drive riku s special running technique known as rodeo drive is very similar to panther s zero gravity run he uses this technique to make an immediate statement at the start of game against the devil bats by returning the opening kickoff for a touchdown sena paid him back by doing the same during seibu s first kickoff he also uses this technique to stop opposing runners however it is not effective against shin s spear tackle nor sena s devil bat tornado taiy sphinx logo sphinx team colours sandy yellow turquoise blue closest nfl match jacksonville jaguars team uniform is striped this strong team is one of the best in the kanagawa prefecture the entire team is made up of idiots except for banba their players act like egyptians because their headmaster after excavating a ruin became obsessed with the egyptians and opened a school that looks like a pyramid their philosophy is based on the importance of the line and they are reputed to have the heaviest however their backfield is substantially less than deimon s due to their philosophy of the importance of the line taiy is considered more of a defensive team they focus on stopping the advance of the opposing side and protecting the quarterback they were originally chosen to go against the nasa aliens due to the fact that just about every member of taiyo sphinx was massively built in which the sponsors assumed they could take the hits from the large american players however thanks to hiruma s computer hacking skills they get involved in a match against the devil bats for the chance to play against the americans their game against deimon ends in a tie 20 20 but banba surrenders the chance to play against the nasa aliens to his opponents after they had shown his team the true spirit and drive to win despite the difference in power size and especially climate the taiyo field is an arid dustbowl one thing to note is that all of the students look somewhat egyptian their skin is dark this is explained in a small snippet all the students are into surfing since shonan beach is right next door hence the tans the four players to take note of are mamoru banba massive center of the team the team captain and powerhouse he holds the high school record for the squat although he is more skillful than kurita he does not have as much raw strength due to his harsh training for the fall tournament banba s face has more scars his build also is much more powerful looking as shown in chapter 200 of the manga so it s presumed his strength has increased as well unfortunately whatever training he had undergone was insufficient to match the dinosaurs powerhouse lineman rikiya ga despite the new formation called tutankhamun s mask banba was pushed down easily at the start of the match at the end of the game he is seen being carried out on a stretcher as he had sustained the most injuries in protecting harao taiyou s quarterback 40 yard dash 5 5 seconds bench press unknown as of most recent appearance 200th down previously 140 kg position center defensive tackle jersey number 50 techniques strategies pyramid line the signature formation of the sphinx the pyramid line involves the linemen going into a v shaped pyramid formation which takes advantage of the heavier built players this gives high protection for the quarterback and makes a formidable obstacle when on defense however it can be defeated by certain tactics like the ha ha brothers juvenile delinquent murder method random player arrangements and the devil bat dive another problem is that harao has difficulty finding a receiver if the huge line moves backward and blocks his view tutankhamen s mask the linemen arrange themselves more tightly together than normal making the spaces between them narrower and forming closer to the quarterback this is alluded to the death mask of the pharaoh in theory the line was made even more secure and harder for the opposing team to break through to sack the quarterback kiminari harao harao kiminari the whining quarterback he bosses everyone around and puts the blame on them until in volume 6 banba sets him straight for some reason he s popular with the ladies and has his own harem he acts like a pharaoh however compared to hiruma his skills as a quarterback are substantially less his over dependence on the pyramid line has made him slower and less able to avoid sacks if he can t find a receiver then he will just stand in place rather than try to run the ball himself he also tends to hold the ball too high when passing which can lead to fumbles when he s tackled though he appears to be an arrogant snob harao is actually quite sensitive about his skills as a quarterback he knows that others consider him as a second rate player even his own team members think so like sakaruba was harao is seen as the ace of the team by his fans though his skills do not match that of his image he admits to banba that since the game against deimon that he has been trying to improve himself but he still has doubts especially since every kantou tournament the sphinx participate but never win due to the other teams being like monsters like banba this will be his third and last kantou tournament banba assured him that the new tutankhamen s mask formation would protect him so all he had to do was throw the ball however as the formation crumbles easily under the power of the dinosaurs monstrous new lineman harao began to experience true fear at half time with the entire roster of linemen sustaining injuries including broken bones and banba out of commission harao was forced to forfeit the match he was the only member who had not been seriously hurt since banba had tried his hardest to protect him he was also the first qb that had faced gaou of the dinosaurs that was still standing at the end of the game however the once proud quarterback takes no solace in this 40 yard dash 5 4 seconds bench press 50 kg position quarterback jersey 8 niinobu kasamatsu the second largest lineman on the pyramid line he talks too much and is always getting the blame from harao and apologizing to him he starts picking on the ha ha brothers but is beaten by juumonji twice first with the juvenile delinquent murder method then with just a normal block he s not very bright and is easily fooled by trick plays and trap blocks during the game with the dinosaurs he is among the casualties and his team is forced to surrender at half time 40 yard dash 5 9 seconds bench press 100 kg position tackle defensive end jersey 66 ken kamaguruma kamaguruma is a large first year who plays cornerback he s a bit dim witted but a pretty good player he gives monta some trouble when he comes in during the second half of the taiyo game he is the chariot for taiyo his moves include chariot bump and chariot attack however monta s catching ability far outstripped his skills it is also shown that his bump technique has no effect against seibu s receiver tetsuma like his teammates kamaguruma is stopped at the

both the jerseys and pants and across the top of the helmet team dress outside of games kind of resembles a buddhist monk s robes before the start of each game the linemen go into a kind of meditation exercise to achieve a zen state of mind supposedly this is to get them mentally prepared for the game and nothing can disturb them when they are like this that is until ikkyu commented on some cute girls the strongest team in the kanagawa area by far known as the gods of kantou they ve won the kantou tournament for 9 years straight four of the players resemble the main characters from journey to the west or as they call it saiyuki the name shinry ji can translate to temple of the dragon god the team is made up of members who are good all rounders with two aces agon and ikkyu as a result they are well balanced in both offense and defense which is directly opposite to deimon s team of specialists their coach is sendou dasumito an old man who looks much like a hermit martial arts master would look like in a martial arts movie he guides the team with seeming wisdom and tactics though he always turns a blind eye toward agon and his lack of discipline due to his god impulse ability another fact about the team is that they had never allowed any opponent a two point conversion against them this record is destroyed along with their bid for a 10th kantou championship when they lose to the devil bats in the opening round in quite possibly the most unbelievable upset in their entire history unsui kong a very strong player not much is known about him but in the previous year s match between the oujou white knights and shinry ji naga both he and his brother as first year players were sent out with 5 minutes to play and oujou holding a 16 3 lead their entrance resulted in a 17 16 victory for shinry ji during their second year spring tournament the nagas trounce the white knights by a score of 40 3 without agon playing at all unsui is passionately devoted to football but is considered merely a good player in contrast agon takes a casual cynical almost scornful approach to the sport but is far better far more serious and intense than agon unsui is much better liked as opposed to feared like his brother is he is a good player because of his wide range of vision allowing him to know where all his players are rather than agon s talent being innate unsui has worked all his life to become as good as he is his workrate seemed to have been recognized when he received a sports scholarship at shinry ji but it turns out it was meant for agon the school got the twins names mixed up he feels his purpose is to back agon up as much as he can to make his god given talents shine even more brightly unsui does recognize deimon s offensive potential and has taken a more conservative approach to defeat them during the second half of the kantou tournament game however with the devil bats counterattacking he is becoming unsure of the outcome his greatest shock comes when eyeshield 21 ignores his brother completely and forces unsui to fumble followed by the unbelievable event in which unsui s seemingly invincible sibling was toppled by sena as the game winds down unsui and the rest of the team are taking no prisoners despite being pressured by agon and ikkuyu to let them have the ball wanting to get revenge on sena and monta respectively for the upsets they ve caused the nagas had decided to just run out the remaining five minutes and prevent deimon from getting any more points the formation they used was an advanced version of the dragon fly their double quarterback trademark play the golden dragon fly has a three quarterback setup featuring ikkyu hosakawa as the third passer and multiple flea flicker style lateral passes using desperate run stuffing tactics deimon were able to hold all but agon who managed to gain a first down as a result of this ploy but they ended up going three and out and were forced to punt shinry ji assume that they have won after pinning the devil bats on their own 2 yard line with just one minute left on the clock and 98 yards separating them however even that was not enough to stop the devil bats instructing the rest of the team to aim for the sidelines in order to stop the clock when they go out of bounds hiruma goes into what is effectively a one man no huddle offense eyeshield 21 gets the ball and heads straight for the sideline but the naga are on to them agon chops into him with one of his most scything tackles so far keeping both sena in bounds and the clock running hiruma then spikes the ball to stop the clock and on the next play uses a diversion to move the chains designating yukimitsu as a lineman he gets him to run a motion play route to the other side of the line before the snap to misdirect shinry ji into blocking the wrong way this led deimon to a first down on their own 13 and 45 seconds left as time continues to tick away hiruma continues to use these sideline spike tactics and the bats make it as far as midfield after an incredible pair of high risk plays and a touchdown by hiruma the nagas now must deal with the possibility of a sudden death overtime or a loss if the devil bats decide on a two point conversion and succeed to everyone s surprise it looks as if deimon will try for overtime as musashi is rushing toward the ball to kick it in sena is placed at the end of the scrimmage line which convinces everyone that he is not going to try for the devil bat dive now the game draws to a close as shinry ji attempts to block the kick however this is not to be as hiruma fakes the kick and rushes toward the goal line with musashi ahead of him the two plow into the nagas defensive line in what appears to be a last ditch power play to score through brute force when it appears that the nagas had stopped them the deimon quarterback wheels about and laterals the ball backward to eyeshield 21 it appears that sena was placed at the end of the scrimmage line to deceive the nagas and had used the faked kick as a distraction to get a running start and attempt the devil bat dive in a spectacular move kurita forces down four nagas including agon and ikkyu allowing eyeshield to fall past the goal line the end result two points final score deimon devil bats 36 shinry ji nagas 35 in the end when agon warns the nagas not to slack off in their training for the next spring tournament and showing his intent to defeat the devil bats unsui feels that his brother is finally beginning to see the value of working with others rather than just depending on his own god given talents 40 yard dash 5 1 seconds bench press 95 kg position quarterback jersey 12 second year student 11th grade techniques strategies dragon fly using both kongo brothers as quarterbacks the ball is passed through multiple laterals among the team members it is a very adaptable strategy but its drawback is that an opponent can intercept the laterals in flight causing a fumble such as eyeshield did with agon golden dragon fly this involves three quarterbacks normally with the kongo brothers and ikkyu this is extremely difficult to stop but it is possible with run stuffing tactics agon kong the kongo twins are like chalk and cheese not only in ability but also in attitude and personality agon kongo is lazy arrogant vicious invariably turns up late to the matches often in the second half and never ever trains yet his skill is incredible he is also a chauvinist who does not take rejection well since when mamori rejected his advances on the bridge he threw her on the ground and advanced on her even though unsui is a solid player whose skill has come from constant hard work agon s abilities go far beyond even the best kumabukuro the reporter says that he has tremendous talent that is only seen once every 100 years even the naga coach wants everybody in the team not to act the way he does and tells them that only agon has the leeway to act in this manner this is because agon s natural talent is near superhuman and allows him to do whatever he wants this has made him arrogant and over confident in his ability he looks down on everyone else even his own older brother whom he calls unko chan as if to scorn him effectively a tautology as he s calling unsui small twice lit little unsui the child initially he displays his agility to sena and makes a powerful bullet pass at torakichi still in his wheelchair who teases their team but luckily is saved by sakuraba monta and sena unknown to any of the main characters he has incredible strength as he beat up the entire zokugaku gang in an instant shortly after this incident sena and mamori encounter agon on their way elsewhere agon tries to accost mamori to help him get to the stadium but sena intervenes agon weasels his way out of this however and as he leaves the pair behind sena feels for the first time he has encountered someone with evil intent while growing up with his twin brother it was discovered early on that agon had a talent for learning complex physical tasks within minutes just after seeing it this is called the god speed impulse reaction he was able to balance and ride a bicycle on his first try his reaction time is at the human limit and is triggered by sight as he grew up his brother unsui encouraged him to develop his amazing ability while he stayed mostly in the background unfortunately this also led to building agon s ego and his tendency to regard everyone else including his own brother as inferior eventually the two began leaning toward american football and were recruited by the nagas agon s god speed impulse is similiar to the marvel comics villain taskmaster and his ability of photo mimetic reactive reflexes during the draw to decide who faces who in the kantou tournament shinry ji and deimon are fated to meet in the first round gods against demons as it were when the time came for shinry ji to draw for their place in the tournament agon took the ball upon seeing sena and threw another bullet pass like the one he threw at torakichi this time aimed directly for sena s right eye sena dodged the ball with the slightest of movements and the pass struck a coke bottle behind him held by maruko the dinosaurs quarterback in an interview at which hiruma is also present agon is shown to have a history with the deimon passer and his laid back cool attitude becomes somewhat rattled whenever he is involved agon s arrogance in his own natural talents cause him to look down on and want to crush those he feels are less talented absolutely everyone else basically he even considers the perfect team to be 22 of myself these are his reasons for playing football as opposed to hiruma s because it s fun he does however recognise hiruma s ability though he immediately counters this by saying he doesn t consider the deimon player a threat agon wants everyone without exception to acknowledge his superiority and is willing to destroy anyone who doesn t do so or gets in his way he also doesn t care for normal people who work hard thinking that only those who are truly gifted are the ones that matter however hiruma is aware of this and plans on using this attitude to cause agon s downfall as the game against deimon continues agon starts to lose his cool as the devil bats begin to fight back from a 32 0 first half thumping he is first upset by the devil bats onside kick then is caught completely off guard when yukimitsu the weakest member of the deimon team scored a touchdown despite being double covered by both him and ikkyu he was able to do this by analysing the nagas defense patterns and picking out option routes third pass route choices in the middle distance as opposed to short passes to taki or long distance bombs to monta on the fly this and yukimitsu s sheer determination to succeed at something other than studying got deimon s first points on the board afterwards eyeshield 21 successfully intercepted a lateral pass meant for agon followed by juumonji recovering the ball as this is classed as a fumble and scoring the second deimon touchdown despite being tackled by the arrogant dreadhead agon ended up being dragged into the endzone by juumonji s sheer force of will eyeshield s interception of unsui s lateral got to him but being unable to prevent juumonji s touchdown return truly rattles him as linemen are not known for their speed however the huh huh brothers are built more like linebackers as opposed to the line build possessed by kurita and komusubi in recent chapters he witnessed the one team mate that he does give credit to cornerback ikkyu hosokawa fail to stop deimon from scoring his version of eyeshield 21 s devil bat ghost surprises everyone but now he is becoming even more enraged as sena forces yet another fumble on his brother ignoring agon completely when the whole shinry ji team thought he was still marking him this is most likely the one thing that can truly upset him not even being bothered with by the ones he most wants to crush in the following chapter 191st down the red mist descends on agon after a lifetime of being praised for his innate skills to be disregarded so completely is something that he is not prepared to stand for and in a fit of fury he tries to take sena down permanently amazingly he fails as he goes to chop the ball out of his grasp sena motions as if he was going to stiff arm agon away agon s surprise is such that he is caught off guard for a split second all the time sena needs to whip a devilbat ghost on him even that is not enough to put off the smug naga however with his lightning reaction time he wheels round to have another shot at sena agon then receives one of the greatest upsets of the entire game as his tackle to stop eyeshield 21 is countered and he is ground face first into the turf since he was in a fit of rage agon had not considered the possibility that his shorter weaker opponent would even try to down him in the game s dying seconds agon is the only person who realises what hiruma s up to with deimon s final drive the final frame of the 194th down shows his menacing stare behind the sports goggles he wears at 18 seconds left in their final drive hiruma takes the snap and makes a fake spike to catch the nagas off guard yukimitsu stayed on the line of scrimmage for this play which allowed monta to go in motion thinking the play was dead because of the fake spike ikkyu who was meant to be covering monta switched off all the chance monta needed to get a head start on him hiruma heaved a bomb in the air for him which ikkyu managed to get a hand to but all he could do was deflect it directly into monta s clutches agon the only person who could see this coming tackled the receiver at shinry ji s red zone with 4 seconds left during this monta shouted catch max again for all he already had the ball agon assumes that he meant catching the ball and arrogantly retorts that it didn t matter if he did catch the ball as long as he was brought down with the clock ticking inexorably down to 0 and shinry ji still a touchdown up it looks as if he had permanently ended deimon s dream to play in the christmas bowl agon s plan was to let monta get so far away that the rest of the bats wouldn t have time to get back into formation for a spike however the referee ruled the play as out of bounds after seeing a lump of turf had been ripped up monta s scream of catch max was nothing to do with the ball as he already had hold of that he was aiming to touch the sideline he opened his fist and revealed the missing bit of turf the ref has the clock reset to 4 seconds because of this now with this being deimon s final play both kongo brothers wonder what hiruma is up to as the deimon quarterback pumps devil bats fans up into a frenzy apparently the cheering crowds were just a diversion hiruma was actually going in motion as he ran side to side pumping the crowd up the play started unexpectedly when the ball was hiked directly to sena the nagas were thrown off guard again as it seemed that sena would use the devil bat ghost with the nagas all over him however he lobbed the ball upwards the nagas were all in disbelief as they had already covered all the receivers who would the ball go to the crowd was also another distraction so that sena could make a pass to hiruma the nagas were already in disbelief in the beginning as the ball was hiked directly to sena after hiruma caught the ball agon still arrogantly believed that he could catch up to hiruma since he remembered that hiruma s best time at the 40 yard sprint was 5 2 seconds when he tried out for the shinry ji nagas however to his complete shock he found out that hiruma had gotten 0 1 seconds faster and that was all he needed to outrun him and score now the score is only 34 35 in favor of the nagas as deimon prepares to go for either a 1 point kick or a 2 point conversion agon then receives the final insult and defeat as the one other deimon member that he despises becomes instrumental in deimon s two point conversion play no other team has ever scored a 2 point conversion against shinry ji sena lined up on the extreme left of the line the huddle before this play boiled down to his decision take the kick and risk overtime with his failing legs or risk the whole game and go for the win this combined with the nagas perfect record against 2 pointers led all to believe that deimon was going to go for the easy kick and take the game into ot indeed musashi came on for the kick and hiruma went into a holder s position once again however it was a fake hiruma held the ball and picked it up rushing with musashi into the middle of shinry ji s goal line defense behind kurita who through sheer determination and willpower pushed agon and ikkyu diagonally altering their centre of gravity before they could get to the ball hiruma meantime lateralled the ball high into the air for sena to catch and perform the devil bat dive thereby shattering the nagas undefeated record both in games and 2 point conversions shocked and dejected agon leaves the field and warns his teammates not to slack off on their training for the spring tournament where he vows to defeat the devil bats position running back but is also known to play free safety as well as special teams receiver kicker and quarterback jersey 2 second year student 11th grade reaction time 0 11 seconds human limit surpassed in 191st down techniques strategies god speed impulse this is agon s innate talent which allows him to move and react with near superhuman speed however this ability has a fatal weakness it only works if he can see the movement when sena placed his hand on the side of agon s helmet this was round the back of it on his blind side and agon was unable to react to it in time also he can use this ability to learn complex physical maneuvers in a short time dragon fly and golden dragon fly see unsui s entry chop agon s preferred method of tackling using the side of his hand in a devastating chop he can send most players to the turf groaning in pain would probably draw a flag and a double digit penalty and likely an ejection for repeated offences in the pros imitation devil bat ghost thanks to his god speed impulse ability agon was able to copy sena s move ikky hosakawa the only person who has an attitude like monta but doesn t eat bananas like monta does his hair resembles vegeta from the manga anime series dragon ball z and he has a red mole in the middle of his forehead by the look of him no one should be intimidated but his true skill lies in his running technique he has the record of 4 9 seconds in the 40 yard dash while running backwards making him the best cornerback in the kanto zone he is the only player on the nagas that agon has any respect for since he is considered a genius he has great respect for agon and is probably the only one on the team who doesn t fear him and actually looks forward to playing with him ikkyu is proud of his jumping and catching ability he tells unsui that no one can beat him on air however kanto s best cornerback is nothing compared to japan s best linebacker shin proves this to him in his first match against him he is always bullied by his teammates because he gets more remarks than they do ikkyu is one of the nicer more friendly players on the team but that doesn t make him any less serious when game time comes he s considered a genius with high jump catches but he is caught off guard when hiruma fakes a hail mary pass and uses an incredibly fast and low bullet pass instead ichiro takami of the oujouu white knights christens it a hail devil pass he still intercepts it but he gets the shock of his life when monta strips the ball out of his hands resulting in a deimon touchdown like agon is acting with sena and hiruma ikkyu is starting to lose his cool with monta he tried to face down the deimon wideout after the touchdown but monta was unimpressed with ikkyu s posturing near the end of the game ikkyu begs for unsui to let him have the ball in order to make up for the upset that the deimon receiver had caused however his request is turned down in favor of just running out the clock he does manage to deflect a pass that was meant for monta and had a chance to catch a loose ball during deimon s two point conversion however in the end he and the nagas lose out to deimon he seems to have a crush on mamori in his less serious moments he sometimes tries to praise his upperclassmen but his attempts are thwarted by his teammates who practice a faux ventriloquist act on him pretending to make him say such things as in fact you can t match the great ikkyuu to which he

golden dragon fly see unsui s entry nasa aliens nasa shuttles team mascot alien team colours blue and yellow different shades to taiyou closer to that of the swedish flag helmet logo an atom with electron paths traced around it this is the american team that deimon plays when they represent japan the whole team is white because their coach leonard apollo is racist the best player on the team panther only picks up balls and is not allowed to play because of his previous mistake in a game and not following through with the coach s instructions although it was later found out that this was merely a rationalization the aliens first play a practice game against zokugaku university s frilled lizards and slaughter them with a score of 73 0 there was a bet before the game with deimon and the terms were that if a team didn t win by more than 10 points then that team would stay in the opposite country japan for nasa us for deimon deimon lost by one point 32 33 but only because they lacked a kicker and sena was too exhausted to try the devil bat dive at the end neither team succeeded in one upping each other by 10 points so deimon went to america while nasa stayed in actuality this was all according to hiruma s plans since he wanted the devil bats to gain more experience against a veteran team and get some training in the united states the more muscular members of the nasa aliens have a habit of getting into a group pose and flexing their muscles in which they believe show off their physiques to all female spectators thereby getting them dates and such so far it hasn t worked patrick panther spencer panther is a good natured person who has extraordinary running talents but has been reduced to being a ballboy due to apollo s predjudice he trains everyday by running across rooftops panther s dream is to become a pro nfl player and make money so that his grandmother would no longer have to work he is also one of the few people who is able to eat his grandmother s horrendous oatmeal recipe initially he wasn t interested in going to japan since he really wanted to compete against shin then he saw eyeshield 21 s running ability on hiruma s web video and wanted to run against him eventually he and sena became good friends and promised to play on equal terms the next time they met on the field sena was nearly at his limit by the time panther had entered the game position running back jersey number 20 40 yard dash unknown but may be comparable to sena s average of 4 5 seconds techniques strategies zero gravity run panther s specialty is called the zero gravity run which allows him to run at great speeds with extremely light footsteps unlike sena s method of sharp turns and cuts panther can run like water using the minimal amount of movement needed to slide around obstacles shin noted that panther s running is too clean and easy to predict which route he will take stiff arm panther also uses one hand to hold onto the ball while the other is extended to ward off opposing blockers this is a standard block used commonly by other running backs in the nfl however this gives his opponent a chance to slap the ball away causing a fumble sena and shin both show this flaw to him and this teaches panther that he needs to get more practice against opposing players moon salute this strategy arranges the linemen in a crescent formation this allows for maximum frontal protection for the running back this is similar to deimon s sweeper tactic but is done in a straight line rather than diagonally the aliens team had been developing this tactic for a long time without apollo s knowledge jeremy watt watt is the best wide receiver of the nasa aliens and he also serves as team s translator though he s more of a pseudo japan scholar meaning that he s more of an otaku than a japan ophile as a result he often gets translations wrong and has some misconceptions concerning japanese culture he is able to calculate the landing point for homer s shuttle pass with pinpoint accuracy like mission control being taller and faster than monta does give him an advantage over the deimon receiver position wide receiver jersey number 81 40 yard dash 4 8 seconds homer fitzgerald homer is the quarterback of the nasa aliens and his specialty is being able to heave a football from over half the length of the field along with watt he s one of panther s closest friends and helped him endure apollo s racial attitude against african americans homer s biggest problem is throwing control as the ball tends to go off course another thing to note is that due to homer s upper body strength tackling him at the waist is not enough to sack him however by going for his passing arm his ability to throw the ball is stopped given his large frame and powerful throwing arm not to mention his tendency to misfire his passes homer could be modeled on green bay packers quarterback brett favre position quarterback jersey number 5 techniques strategies shuttle pass the shuttle pass is considered the signature move of the team homer starts by counting down from three and throws the ball for his receiver to catch usually near the goal line of the opposing team the problem with this tactic is that it requires a longer time to initiate the pass which leaves the quarterback open to blitzes that result in sacks the muscle barrier the name given to the line is crucial in ensuring the success of the pass gonzales big brother the largest member on the nasa aliens even bigger than kurita he plays center on the line his massive size and crushing power will reduce any lesser player to pulp however his slow speed makes it easy for faster opponents to dodge his catch phrase is big useful before going to japan he wanted to get a kanji tattoo which meant big and useful guy he asked watt about the kanji for big and useful however due to a mis translation by watt when putting those two kanji together the end result was poop in the end his tattoo means big poop guy position center guard jersey number 50 gonzales little brother though lacking in size and overall strength of his sibling the younger gonzales makes up for it in speed and tenacity he s about the same size as komusubi he admires his brother and wanted to be known as the small helpful guy in a way he is to his big brother like komusubi is to kurita his catch phrase is don t look down on me unfortunately he went to watt for a kanji tattoo as well and the kanji for small and helpful translates as pee and that gives him the title of little pee guy he is also easily fooled by handoff fakes position linebacker jersey number 70 leonard apollo apollo is the coach of the nasa aliens team and has an extreme prejudice against those who have innate talents rather than using skills earned by training this is the main reason why he does not allow panther to play during games and had him picking up balls he s also racist against african americans for their natural sprinting ability and he dislikes the japanese as well thinking that they are weak and submissive as compared to the americans due to this attitude he cancels the game against the devil bats in response to this hiruma creates an insulting web video he sends it over the internet which directly calls apollo a chicken for refusing to face deimon and humiliates the nasa coach worldwide outraged apollo reschedules their match stating that if the aliens do not crush the devil bats by at least 10 points then the americans would not return to the united states in truth the coach s real motivation for excluding panther is really jealousy it is a somewhat tragic story in his days as an nfl player apollo despite his considerable efforts such as training three times more than anyone was never more than a benchwarmer when it looked like he would finally play the bigwigs of his team hired morgan an extremely talented sprinter and yes an african american much like panther he was cut from the team and the flashback he had during the deimon game showed him asking for one more chance but being denied another chance bitter about it all apollo went on to found an ideal high school team that relied solely in perfectly executed and superior strategies without leaning on the performance of white talented aces also whenever any one of the team members of the nasa aliens made a mistake he would immediately be substituted when apollo s strategies during the deimon game crumbled in front of hiruma s tricks and eyeshield s speed apollo reluctantly allowed panther to play after the whole team begged him to panther himself said that he would quit the team if he failed to stop eyeshield and win the game if he were to be given one more chance this caused a flashback for apollo while panther was playing on defense watt and homer revealed that for a long time despite how badly panther was treated panther had always admired apollo because he was a hard working man panther like apollo had trained three times as hard as a ballboy and secretly with the rest of the team there was another flashback of panther when he was little in which he declared that he had to be on apollo s team no matter what despite the failure to win by ten points the coach commented with his back turned during the hand shaking that it was a good game when the alien s change their name to the nasa shuttles and board a bus to leave japan apollo reminded panther of the deal which panther didn t exactly accomplish on his end never call yourself a nasa alien again however apollo told him that there would be a number 20 uniform for the running back panther of the new nasa shuttles team 20 was apollo s uniform number during his nfl days with the san antonio armadillos this was the loophole which allowed the team to go back to america and let panther play as a part of position coach bando spiders logo spider with a guitar uniform and helmet designs feature spider s webs black webs on a scarlet background similar in design to the costume worn by spider man this is the team that the devil bats face after losing to the seibu wild gunmen in the qualifying eliminator for the kantou championship monta believed all was lost after a play that could have gone either way was called in seibu s favour leading him to rage at a game official it was following the end of the game that hiruma let slip that they had another chance by finishing third in the tournament the 3rd 4th place repechage game is deimon vs bando deimon won 37 36 the team has a philosophy of being a kick team due to koutarou sasaki s kicking ability and also because most of the original members of the bando spiders transferred to another school leaving only the members of the kick formation left this makes them take on an offensive stance like deimon in which one point can make all the difference akaba hayato the fullback for the spiders wears a blue tinted visor in his helmet to set him apart from sena s which is green originally believed by many to be the real eyeshield 21 the ace from notre dame tall and thin hayato hardly looks like the intimadating figure of an ace player leading many to underestimate him and his skills and even hiruma agrees he deserves the title of eyeshield 21 in spite of his unimposing build hayato can send even kurita flying with just his arms he had first transferred out of bando but later decided to go back out of loyalty to his teammates due to school transfer policy he was unable to play against oujou resulting in the spiders losing when he went against the deimon team he almost single handedly defeats sena and taki however due to taki getting serious the devil bats are able to comeback and win after getting defeated by sena s lightspeed running he graciously gives sena his blue visor telling him that he deserves to be called eyeshield 21 like almost all the students at bando akaba plays an instrument in this case he plays guitar akaba s eyes are naturally brown he wears red contacts position linebacker fullback jersey number 21 techniques strategies spider poison by thrusting out with both arms and hitting the shoulders of his opponents he is able to push them off and cause temporary numbness the real key to this technique is that by studying the opposing teams in advance akaba learns when the opposing players center of gravity shifts by knowing this and akaba can push the opponent over with ease no matter how strong they are since he also tells his entire team when the other players center of gravity shifts so they too implement this technique run force by positioning the blockers in a certain way akaba can actually force the running back into moving where he wants him to go this way akaba knows exactly where the running back will be so he can position himself ahead of time this technique is similar or maybe even identical to sena s ability to determine the most appropriate path to run koutarou sasaki sasaki k tar the kicker for the bando spiders he is a direct rival of musashi and as noted by hiruma he has never missed a try for point kick he even once kicked a soft drink can right into a rubbish bin made specifically for cans off of a bridge railing his skills as a kicker is seen when he could easily get a field goal from 50 yards it is because of him that the bando spiders adopted the philosophy of a kicking team a team that relies on kicks to win the game however his accuracy can also be used against him since it s easy to predict where his kicks will land and they can then be returned koutarou s most famous quote is that s smart otherwise that s not smart etc and is seen combing his hair whenever he has time even during a match he seems to dislike akaba hayato because he keeps talking about music koutarou used up a time out just to explain the history of the spiders to deimon his last name is the same as a famous samurai sasaki koujiro a rival of miyamoto musashi he seems to have asked bando s manager sawai juri usually

linebacker munakata proclaims that he can defeat eyeshield 21 the rest of the game was an easy win for the devil bats even though the sports medical science did make the amino players stronger they

players who play both sides of the ball offense and defense weren t even tired atsushi munakata the team captain and linebacker of the amino cyborgs he was also the team captain of amino s basketball and soccer clubs winning the championships of those as well he s a massively built player with a politician s personality however he had made a serious mistake during the summer in which the devil bats were in the united states he had assumed that eyeshield 21 would be the same as he was during the spring season so he had practiced to counter sena s habit of stopping before accelerating however during the cyborg s first and only fall game he was soundly defeated by the devil bat ghost he soon suffers a nervous breakdown as his faith in medical science is shattered position linebacker jersey

change his direction in an instant suguru aoyanagi he used to be a scrawny student until he took the amino training program for 6 months this included going to the gym twice a week and taking an unbelievable amount of vitamin supplements and whatever else medical science could provide he thought that he was unstoppable and in the first few minutes of the game against deimon it seemed to be true then the devil bats trainer reminded them of the proper techniques and suguru was crushed along with the rest of the amino line he also suffers a breakdown as the muscles he gained through

the team s cheerleading squad captain otohime is said to have a crush on kengo mizumachi because of his pure and immature heart and apparently joined the club because of a diet the team is highly

plays on the line and uses his height and speed from a swimmer s start to great advantage he has a bad habit of saying inappropriate and insensitive remarks he is also known to strip down to his boxers in front of people and seems to hate football equipment saying that it s too heavy i can t move properly apparently modesty is not an issue initially he looks down no pun intended on komusubi of the deimon team due to how short he is but learns there is a lot of strength in komusubi s small frame and was defeated by him at the end of the game also mizumachi seems to understand powerful go the true language of truly strong men as he responded positively to komusubi s post game grunt of hot he also likes swimming and spying on the females half of the bathhouse when the kyoshin team relaxes stating that the only thing to do when you go to a public bathhouse is to swim or peek right jersey number 71 position tackle defensive end techniques strategies swimmer s start mizumachi assumes the position that olympic swimmers use on the starting block this lowers his center of gravity and allows him to spring forward much like komusubi can with his fast start technique however mizumachi s method has a fatal flaw as soon as he brings his arm upward in the swim position his chest is exposed and he is slightly off balance this allows komusubi to knock him down like a bowling pin formation poseidon mizumachi leaves the line and joins kakei and the other linebackers behind the defensive line though this weakens the line it strengthens the passing defense while kakei controls the opponents run this formation can be summed up as as a 3 4 defense where a defensive linemen leaves the line and joins the linebackers 3 linemen and 4 linebackers shun kakei the fourth tallest player on the team and the de facto captain went to school in america for a year and met the real eyeshield 21 this was during his middle school years and at that time he had lost interest in american football until he went up against notre dame s eyeshield 21 the encounter inspired him to train with new enthusiasm as he promised to meet up with him again at the finals however when the game against notre dame finally came around eyeshield 21 was nowhere to be found shun asked around for his whereabouts but no one seemed to know who he was or even if he existed shun claimed that sena was a fake since the eyeshield he knew was far taller he then declared to defeat the devil bat s imposter he later admits that sena is deserving of the title of eyeshield 21 and tells him to keep fighting until the final game and he s like the shin of the team except he has shinier hair and is actually more serious than shin shun seems to be used to his teammates immature actions he is so use to it he can even ignore the fact that sena monta and his other teammates were trying to stop mizumachi from peeking at the bathhouse and making a big fuss out of it who were then pushed right through the wall by urashima kyoshin s cheerleader vice captain even saying calmly yes akaba hayato s block is as powerful as that jersey number 41 position linebacker strategies techniques one handed block shun sticks his hand out and blocks the opponent down by way of pushing him in the face this move is similar to the now illegal head slap maneuver used by former nfl player deacon jones moby dick anchor shun uses both of his arms and tackles his opponent in a cross grapple across the waist similar to shin s double spear tackle shun was able to stop sena s devil bat ghost with this move however it was ineffective against the devil bat tornado high wave this strategy assembles all tall players at the scrimmage line and has them leap upwards simultaneously thereby preventing the opposing quarterback from passing it is also used for defensive blocking against a run however this strategy is countered by hiruma s wishbone tactic kobanzame osamu kobanzame is the short nervous captain of the poseidons unlike the underclassmen on the team kobanzame and the other members in their last year are unusually short during the match against the deers the announcer mentioned that the deer and the poseidons were two of the shortest teams in the league this was until the poseidons revealed their new freshmen who used their height to their advantage kobanzame is a comic character who has a tendency to stutter and mess up quotations in his attempts to raise the morale on the team you first see him when he travels with another upperclassman or ohira and onishi in the anime to go spy on deimon s training when his friend protests that they should not be doing something underhanded kobanzame claimed that there was no harm in simply taking a peek as they happened to walk by while climbing up the fence to get a better view however he was hit in the head by a ladder during monta s attempt to imitate mizumachi s height kobanzame s spying did allow him to recognize sena right away when hiruma sent him disguised as a delivery boy to the poseidon s clubhouse kobanzame immediately called sena on his deception ignoring that he had done the same just hours before the lump remaining on his head to prove it and brought the the devilbat to kakei s attention this later led sena to learn more about kakei s personal feelings towards the fake eyeshield 21 from kakei himself as well as being expanded upon by mizumachi kobanzame s relationship to the other poseidons is revealed through several flashbacks in the manga as well as their conversations according to the author kobanzame is ranked second in the series in terms of shyness only sena himself is worse because of this he is often unsure of what to do and will wait for kakei to decide on something before saying right that is exactly what i was thinking and trying to maintain his role as captain he has a tendency to complain a lot but kakei mentioned that kobanzame was the only other poseidon to complete the same hellish amount of training as mizumachi mizumachi and kobanzame seem to be fairly close to one another and mizumachi even attempts to convince sena that the poseidons deserve to win the game more because the devil bats have no third years on their team while many of the poseidons including kobanzame are in their last year of course mizumachi did not realize that it was the last year for the second years from deimon as well since they have a no play policy in their third year when the devil bat poseidon match comes down to one final play to determine the game kobanzame confesses to kakei and the others in a joking manner that once again he is forced to sit uselessly on the bench while they do all the hard work this surprises his team mates who have never even considered the possibility that kobanzame and the other upperclassmen have been holding them back they promise to bring kobanzame his ticket to the finals and head out to the field leaving kobanzame alone to think about all the times he tried to make up for his lackluster abilities by doing other things such as gathering information on the poseidon s opponents and boosting morale of course the poseidons lose and mizumachi feels so dejected that he starts wailing on the field because the dreams of the third years are over kobanzame overcome by emotion concludes the match by saying that eighth is not so bad and that even though the last summer was the hardest in his life it was also the best kobanzame unfortunately does have a poor body unsuited for football he is short slow and weak however he does have the skill to be a quarterback and is sort of a quietly skilled player that is overshadowned literally and figuratively by his larger than life team mates in the entire tournament he has never been intercepted his passes are always accurate and much like hiruma he can react quickly when an opponent attempts to take the ball his quick reaction time is more driven by fear than quick thinking however takami even praised kobanzame calling him a good quarterback in the anime the devil bats managed to intercept his pass when hiruma in true hiruma style frightened osamu so badly he threw the ball too fast and the

team chant is patience determination endurance yuuhi high is famous for having ace teams in all sports except for american football as a result the team is made of mediocre players with low morale little to no club funds second hand equipment and a small team roster about 10 players the team is considered weak as compared to the other clubs at yuuhi but this fact only spurs them to train harder training sessions include marathons on the beach in loincloths squat jumping up and down steps towing tractor tires behind them and so forth they go against deimon in the fall tournament and lose miserably 7 56 but one should take note that the coach had used aces from the other sports teams while benching the regulars when it was apparent that the aces couldn t win against the devil bats the regulars were allowed to play and they did manage a touchdown in the manga in the anime the aces scored the touchdown while the regulars only managed first down but they still showed a better performance and dedication than the aces atsumi daisuke the team captain of yuuhi guts as well as the quarterback he s been leading the members though a series of intense training for 3 years though it s not like the death march the devil bats underwent atsumi is considered slightly below average as a player or as hiruma put it he s the best of the worst and the devil bat quarterback gave atsumi s team a 1 chance of beating deimon he seems very grounded and is one of the few players shown that sees through hiruma s scare tactics immediately like kid when the coach decided to replace the regulars with aces from the other sports clubs soccer sumo karate baseball etc atsumi reluctantly agreed that they had better skills at that point hiruma dropped yuuhi s chances of winning down to 0 a newly formed team of aces couldn t deal with deimon s explosive offense power and the addition of their tight end taki by half time the yuuhi guts were trailing by more than 20 points the other players knowing that atsumi really wants to face deimon feign injury and illness and the coach eventually gives up allowing atsumi and the rest of the real football team to enter the game they managed

forfeit while the other games were won by taking out the opposing team s aces they were able to win so many games by predicting the actions of their opponents the scorpions face off against deimon in the third round but their style of play proved to be no match against hiruma s deceit they lose with a score of 12 42 in the anime 0 42 in the manga kanagushia he s the team captain and safety his belief is that football is a mind game he wears his long hair in a braid that stands up like a scorpion s tail whenever he s excited or angry kanagushia is able to predict the opposing team s strategies by reading the telltale signs of the players things such as glances body movements and certain behaviors allow him to figure out what kind of play the other team will use however hiruma already knew about kanagushia s strategies and used several tricks including lipstick and his own brand of psychological warfare to confound him in the end the scorpions were stung by their own poison

the cincinnati bengals in design at least colours are as yet unknown thick slashes of a dark colour adorn the whole jersey and helmets two eyes peer out on the front of the helmets as well and a row of sharp teeth are just above the facemask very little has been revealed on this team until recently in a newspaper article after the spring tournament they were mentioned alongside deimon and below tournament mainstays like shinryuji oujou seibu and taiyo as a team to watch particularly due to some massive new talent that they had recruited as they had made it to the final eight of the kantou tournament the team is slowly being revealed possibly as a potential final opponent in the kantou final for the devil bats after thrashing the taiyo sphinx in the quarterfinals by a halftime score of 32 0 and forcing the sphinx to forfeit due to a lack of players fit to continue the team will be playing the seibu wild gunmen in the semifinals with the winner taking on the deimon oujou winner in the christmas bowl with the talent or should that be raw power that has been revealed thus far it seems the road to the christmas bowl for oujouu or deimon goes through hakushuu maruko marco the dinosaurs quarterback who told sena and monta to call him marco instead of maruko because maruko is a female name in japan ko is primarily a feminine name ending and marco sounds like a male italian name he wanted the strong teams to knock each other out so his team could take it easy so he offered to switch with deimon but just then oujouu s ootawara drew out number 7 deimon had 5 deimon would meet oujouu in the semifinals so he told them to forget it he was especially glad he didn t switch when the nagas drew number 6 which meant that they would face the devil bats first after the devil bats defeat the nagas his personality takes on a more confident attitude partly due to fact that he didn t have to face off against the former kantou champions and partly because his team has a new monstrous lineman that holds the record for the bench press 200 kg marco said during an interview that he likes girls with love position quarterback rikiya ga the gigantic lineman playing for the dinosaurs he holds the record for bench press in all of japan 200 kg and whose appearance even scares the similarly massive taiyou lineman banba he s larger than any other player shown in the series and is reported to have sent all of his opponents quarterbacks to the hospital a regular plastic mouthpiece will not work since he ll chew it to bits like gum he uses a titanium alloy mouthpiece his power is gradually being revealed as he begins to play against taiyo his first devastating move in the tournament was breaking through the sphinx s newest formation the tutankhamen mask and pushing down banba and harao with ease by half time with the score 32 0 in favor of the dinosaurs the entire taiyou line was out of the match due to injuries from trying to hold ga back the most devastating loss was with banba as he was carried away on a stretcher as a result the sphinx team was forced to surrender the game surprisingly ga showed a sense of honor rather than being depicted as a wholly violent brute he admired banba for his determination to protect the quarterback even though harao had long given up the will to win hiruma and kid also noticed that there was more to ga than meets the eye stating that the huge lineman was not suffering from a lack of control of his strength but rather that ga didn t feel like controlling it after the quarterfinal match he nearly lost it when one of the fans openly threw insults at banba this was the same arrogant soccer player that monta and sena had mistaken for musashi muro satoshi this made ga lose his temper causing him to rip off the steel guardrails of the stadium seats and charge into the bleachers he would have trampled anyone who got in his way and most likely would have crushed the cowardly soccer player but before he could get to the fan riku from the seibu wild gunmen ran to his aid protecting him and standing up to the monstrous player it appears that the two will meet again in the semi finals when hakushuu and seibu play each other it seems that now agon and the naga have been knocked out of kantou ga and the dinosaurs are being lined up as the next boss style character and team that sena and the bats will square off against that is if they manage to overcome the white knights in the semis and the dinosaurs defeat seibu benchpress 200 kg high school record position lineman jersey number 70 misaki wolves logo wolf

introduction at the tournament lottery says that they make their way across the land with their fangs claws and speed this is the first team the seibu gunmen play against at the kantou tournament though they are largely a joke when riku faces ga after the hakushuu taiyou match they loosely promise to meet at the next level while the wolves protest feebly in the background that they have yet to play against seibu kamiya taiga the wolves captain his position is unclear he often boasts about his long legs which help him to run faster he has short light colored hair much like riku s a horizontal scar across his nose and a fang poking out of his mouth at all times from the interview with kumabukuro s daughter he appears confident to the point of arrogance saying you can see my strong point right here can t you it s these long legs while some of the other players decline to mention their advantages shin marco and kid when asked what players he would watch out for he says myself is probably not the right thing to say agon though i m stronger than he is speed appears to be his only tactic before the game with seibu he also says the level of my lead makes it feel like

 id=7111021 title ann bassett nonfiltered 505 processed 501 dbindex 450508 ann bassett may 12 1878 may 8 1956 also known as queen ann bassett was a female outlaw and rancher of the old west and one of the two sisters that became known as the bassett girls early life bassett was born to herb bassett and elizabeth chamberlain bassett near browns park but in utah the second of two daughters her sister josie being born in 1874 herb bassett was twenty years senior to elizabeth chamberlain bassett and the couple moved to browns park some time around the early 1870s herb bassett had a profitable cattle ranch which straddled both utah and wyoming and partly in colorado and often did business with notable outlaws of the era such as butch cassidy kid curry and black jack ketchum selling them horses and beef for supplies both ann and josie bassett were attractive young women well taught by their father in the arts of horse riding roping and shooting both were educated early on in prominent boarding schools and were intelligent and articulate in their speech but both chose to return to the life of ranching by the time ann bassett was 15 she had became involved romantically with butch cassidy her sister josie also dated members of the gang to include elzy lay outlaws ben kilpatrick and will news carver who were both later members of the wild bunch gang also dated the sisters it was through these associations that bassett was first exposed to the outlaw life outlaw life in 1896 several cattle barons in the area made attempts to purchase the bassett ranch from the bassett s when they refused several began to rustle their cattle ann bassett and her sister josie in turn rustled cattle from the opposing cattle barons this led to a feud and resulted in the cattlemen bringing in killer for hire tom horn to deal with what the wealthy cattlemen deemed to be rustlers horn did eliminate several known rustlers during that time and later he did kill two known rustlers who were known to be associated with the bassett family islam dart and matt rush in 1900 however horn did not take any actions against the bassett s and his killing of dart and rush was due to another matter unrelated to the bassett issue by 1896 josie bassett was heavily involved in a relationship with elzy lay cassidy s closest friend josie had also became involved with cassidy shortly after his release from an eighteen month prison sentence during which time ann was involved with ben kilpatrick when elzy lay began a relationship with a woman named maude davis josie became involved with will news carver and ann returned to her involvement with cassidy through their relationships with the outlaws and in exchange for their supplying the outlaws with beef and fresh horses from their ranch the two sisters were in a position to get assistance from cassidy and his gang in dealing with certain cattlemen who were pressuring them to sell this association was a deterrent that kept cowboys hired to harass the sisters from doing so for fear of retribution from the outlaws there was even one report that kid curry easily the most feared member of the wild bunch gang once paid a visit to several cowboys known to be employed by the cattlemen warning them to leave the bassett s alone that cannot be confirmed but although the problems with the wealthy cattlemen s association continued well into 1902 by late 1899 the problems were rare and there was little pressure placed on the sisters to sell their ranch despite the seemingly constant changes in romantic partners by both the bassett sisters and the gang members there is no report of there ever being any animosity as a result of this and it seemed to simply be the accepted way that things were although both sisters were taking part in the fight against the powerful cattlemen s associations it was ann that had became best known and newspapers as well as friends had dubbed her queen ann bassett in early 1897 bassett joined cassidy at robbers roost elzy lay having ended his relationship with josie bassett joined them with his girlfriend maude davis according to reports of the day bassett and davis were two of only five women ever allowed into the robbers roost hideout the other three being josie bassett the sundance kids girlfriend etta place and wild bunch gang member laura bullion by april 1897 the two women were sent home so cassidy and his gang could concentrate on their next robbery cassidy would continue his romantic involvement with bassett off and on for another four years seeing her whenever he was near her ranch the total length of their relationship was around seven years but was interrupted often with his being away and for an eighteen month period when he was in prison starting in 1894 during which time she was involved with ben kilpatrick by 1903 bassett had married a rancher by the name of henry bernard shortly after the marriage she was arrested for cattle rustling she stood trial but was acquitted and released the marriage lasted six years ending in divorce with bernard helping bassett and her sister josie in maintaining their ranch bassett girls in later life by 1904 most of the outlaws associated with the bassett girls were either dead or had been captured by lawmen ann bassett never saw cassidy again after he first departed for south america josie bassett is alleged to have been involved off and on with will carver until he was killed by lawmen in 1901 several other outlaws from lesser known gangs drifted in and out of the ranch usually visiting only to obtain beef or fresh horses and have a place to stay for a few days elzy lay reportedly visited the ranch again in 1906 shortly after his release from prison before moving on to california where he lived out the remainder of his life as a respectable businessman herb bassett died on july 30 1918 ann bassett remarried in 1928 to cattleman frank willis the couple remained in utah where they began ranching and where she remained for the rest of her life willis reportedly loved her dearly and the two worked closely together in their business before she died she requested that she be cremated and that her remains be spread across her birthplace in northern utah however willis is alleged to have grieved greatly over her death and was unable to complete that task keeping her ashes in his car for the remainder of his life when he died in 1963 their family buried ann bassett s ashes in an undisclosed location in browns park josie bassett lived most of her life on her fathers property operating the ranch and choosing a mostly outdoor life with camping fishing and hunting being her primary hobbies she eventually moved in 1913 to a homestead near vernal utah where she began ranching josie was romantically linked to many outlaws of the late 19th century and some prominent men of the early 20th century and married five times during the 1930s she became well known for supplying beef at no cost to families in need during the great depression she also bootlegged whiskey during that time in later life she was described as a reclusive eccentric often talking to neighbors about the days of excitement in her youth the alleged ann bassett etta place connection ann bassett has often been accused of having actually been etta place the girlfriend of the sundance kid and who mysteriously disappeared from all public records in 1909 not long after his death according to the reports bassett had led a double life dating cassidy as ann bassett and dating the sundance kid as etta place some speculation even indicates that she was involved with both outlaws at the same time of course with their full knowledge and that by 1900 when in their company she simply went by the name of etta place however although they were likely close in age the dates do not match up when comparing place s time in south america at the time there are documented instances showing bassett to have been in wyoming and colorado pinkerton reports give almost identical descriptions of both women listing both with classic good looks articulate speech and intelligence the same hair color describing both as being good with a rifle and riding a horse and describing both as being promiscuous with both having taken several lovers author and researcher doris karren barton indicates in her 1992 book queen ann bassett alias etta place that often when bassett is absent from historical records place is actively traveling with cassidy and the sundance kid harry longabaugh and when place is absent from historical records bassett is visible however barton excludes the fact that when place was most definitely in south america with cassidy and longabaugh in 1903 bassett was most definitely under arrest for cattle rustling in utah and recently married place had without a doubt departed for south america with longabaugh in august 1902 not to return to the united states specifically new york city until the summer of 1904 bassett was most definitely married incarcerated tried and released over a span of several months in 1903 when comparing the only legitimate photograph of place with the best photograph of bassett the two women do look similar both are pretty with similar facial features hair color and physical build however most historians discount the claims and they were actually two separate people not one in the same ann bassett and etta place definitely knew one another and were alleged to have been at the robbers roost hideout at the same time on more than one occasion but they were not the same person it is more likely although also prone to inconsistencies that etta place could have actually been a brothel owner named eunice gray who established that business in fort worth texas around 1909 gray died in a fire in 1962 prior to that there were at least two people who could have confirmed as to whether place was in fact eunice gray female wild bunch gang member laura bullion was one she died in 1961 the last known person who actually knew etta place and who could have confirmed as to whether eunice gray actually was etta place was ann s sister josie who died in 1963 there are no indications that she was ever asked to do so external links ann bassett brief bio butch cassidy timeline wild bunch elzy lay place bassett similarities the bassett girls

beer adriaanse they are best known for classic songs in afrikaans such as alles is o k karoo poison elvis bly in niekerkshoop and piekniek oppi maan early history of band members bertie coetzee born 1984 grew up on a farm next to the orange river in the rural farm district of the northern cape south africa he started playing guitar and his loving mother drove him to guitar practice every friday afternoon in a distant town 3 hours away his first appearance in front of people was at the annual prieska gholf day festivities where he performed a version of leon schuster s pretty kabousie the first school he attended had 15 pupils and his grandmother was the principal at age 7 he was sent to school and had to stay in the school s hostel since it was a couple of hundred miles from his home later in life his experiences on the farm and the small towns in the district gave him the inspiration for the songs he would write with zinkplaat at age 14 he was sent to paul roos gymnasium in the western cape in this school he was exposed to a whole array of different and interesting characters especially since children from all over south africa namibia and zimbabwe were sent to this school he continued playing guitar and started living and loving the musical landscape of stellenbosch in the school s residence where he stayed he met beer born beer adriaanse 1985 who was a year younger than him and came from durbanville he was a drummer in a punk band called my pet sock and a music lover of note he also met basson laubscher born 1984 a day scholar from kuilsrivier who stayed on a small holding beteen stellenbosch and kuilsrivier basson son of legendary south african karate master bakkies laubscher had also been playing guitar since he was young and was falling around between bands and honing his skills he was friends with the bad seeds in the school and was a truant of note formation of the band in 2002 bertie organized a school songwriters contest and won it himself to record two songs at the studio of j rgen von wechmar the legendary sound engineer who recorded many albums for artists such as the sprinbok nude girls and valiant swart for the recording he teamed up with basson who also took part in the contest but whose fellow band member was caught by the police for alleged possession of the seed of an illegal substance and thus couldn t take part leaving basson to struggle through a solo performance the recording took part in one day and two of bertie s own compositions was chosen blikkitaar blues and jan papier both had strong senses of the karoo and the open spaces of bertie s home district with the sound of an acoustic guitar and a harmonica and the electric sound of basson s guitar the short demo had a rootsy feel and a honest and rugged vibe randomly the name zinkplaat was chosen for the band and the demo was sold in and around stellenbosch for r20 and was introduced to the 17 year old beer by a friend in the school residence although he was still in a punk band the sound of this 18 year old s voice and stripped down sound impressed him greatly and he started joking with bertie that if he ever needed a drummer for his band he would love to help throughout the rest of that year bertie and basson played small gigs in the boland and started working up a repertoire at the start of the next year they had secured a gig at the annual wingerstok festival and started shopping around for a band they approached beer who was still in school at that time and he duly said yes by this time bertie had also met beitel who was attending the same university as himself beitel born jaco van der merwe in 1984 was a veteran bass player from bloemfontein he attended grey college the rival school of paul roos and had been playing in various bands since the age of 14 he was also a part time member of the bloemfontein musicon as second bass player as he made the move to stellenbosch he left his band sprincan and with the advice of his mother left his bass guitar in bloemfontein as bertie started hearing about beitel s skills he approached him one day in the street and convinced him to come for a jam before this final line up was cemented however bertie and basson went to the wingerstok festival with another drummer and bassist from the jesse jordan band on their return they had decided to try out beitel and beer and bertie organized zinkplaat s official fist practice shortly thereafter they played their first gig in tollies in stellenbosch and although video footage of this evening shows a rusty and inexperienced group the crowd loved it and the uniqueness of the group is evident it also helped them in securing a few shows at the klein karoo nasionale kunstefees at the rock art band stand and it was here that zinkplaat started capturing the public s attention they were far younger than their contemporaries clocking in at 18 and 17 years of age where other groups such as gian groen jesse jordan akkedis karen zoid and skallabrak were well into their thirties and fourties right after the kknk bertie borrowed some money from his father and zinkplaat went into sunset studios to record their debut the karoo poison ep with the backbone of the drums and the bass being added zinkplaat now had a much stronger and unique sound though still sounding rough and unpolished easily switching from hard driving rock to calm ballads like grondpad this album was an accurate sample of the new direction afrikaans music would go in and served as hope and influence for many other young bands as this was a year before fokofpolisiekar shocked the nation with their anti christian statements and more than a year before south africa opened their own music channel mk89 the scene was still rather small for afrikaans rock bands and it would still be a time before it would be considered cool to sing afrikaans this was further enhanced by one of the top publications die burger starting their own afrikaans rock band competition for schools called rockspaaider zinkplaat seamlessly cruised through this growing phase in afrikaans music and in important ways helped shape it endofarticle doc doc

palestine captured and militarily occupied by egypt and jordan and later in the six day war by israel the designation refers to the west bank gaza strip and east jerusalem but does not include the golan heights or the sinai peninsula which were also captured by israel in 1967 although the sinai peninsula was later returned to egypt name other terms used to describe these areas together are occupied palestinian territories israeli occupied territories though all of these are in context simply referred to as the occupied territories more terms include disputed territories judea and samaria and gaza yesha liberated territories 1967 territories and simply the territories the united nations generally uses the term occupied palestinian territory with the palestinian label having gained use since the 1970s previous unsc resolutions such as 242 and 338 use the term territories occupied by israel whereas in the un general assembly resolution 181 passed on november 29 1947 the term samaria and judea was used many jews object to the term palestinian territories which they perceive as a rejection of what is in their view legitimate jewish land according to what the believe to be god s word in the hebrew bible likewise some palestinians arabs and muslims object to the term israel which they perceive as a rejection of what is in their view legitimate palestinian land political status the political status of these territories has been the subject of negotiations between israel and the palestine liberation organization plo and of numerous statements and resolutions by the united nations see list of the un resolutions concerning israel for further details the current and future political status of the territories is highly controversial specific issues include the legality of israeli s policy of encouraging settlement whether it is legitimate for israel to annex portions of the territories whether israel is legally an occupying power according to the fourth geneva convention and whether an independent arab state will be created in the territories see proposals for a palestinian state since 1994 the autonomous palestinian authority has exercised various degrees of control in large parts of the territories pursuant to the oslo accords the israeli government s position remains to be defined following that country s 2006 legislative elections but it appears that the new government will pursue a policy of partial withdrawal if necessary unilaterally from the west bank an initiative known as the realignment plan while aiming to retain all of east jerusalem and some other areas including major west bank settlement blocks boundaries the boundaries between the west bank and the gaza strip and the state of israel known as the green line are a result of the 1949 armistice agreements after the 1948 arab israeli war while their boundaries with jordan and egypt follow the international border between the former mandate for palestine and those states the natural geographic boundaries for the west bank and the gaza strip are the jordan river and the mediterranean sea respectively between 1949 and 1967 these territories were occupied by jordan and egypt respectively but the term palestinian territories or occupied palestinian territories gained wide usage after israel s victory in the 1967 six day war about the same time as the term palestinian first started to be used exclusively in respect to arab population of palestine since then the united nations and most foreign governments regard the territories as being under israeli military occupation since 1994 the autonomous palestinian authority has exercised various degrees of control in large parts of the territories pursuant to the oslo accords the term palestinian territories generally the term palestinian territories is used by journalists to indicate lands where palestinian people dwell outside the green line or the 1949 armistice lines some arab nationalists who consider the land within israel s de facto boundaries to be de jure part of a palestinian state some advocates have claimed that maps used in schools under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority depict this state as consisting of all the territory between the mediterranean sea lebanon syria the jordan river and egypt including israel the west bank and gaza strip the term is often used interchangeably with the term occupied territories although the latter refers to an inclusive set of both the palestinian territories and the golan heights the golan is not settled by palestinians nor claimed by them but rather by syria though the tiny shebaa farms area is also claimed by lebanon the confusion stems from the fact that all these territories were captured by israel during the 1967 six day war and are regarded by the united nations as being under military occupation some especially in the right wing sectors of israeli society assert that the term occupied palestinian lands is the common language of arab anti israel propaganda a part of the arabs fictional history which it has succeeded in disseminating throughout the whole wide world impartial groups should not be blind to the fact that there are two sides to the dispute in palestine and that israel rejects absolutely the notion that it is illegally holding palestinian lands history in 1922 after the collapse of the ottoman empire that ruled the region of palestine for four centuries 1517 1917 the mandate for palestine was established large scale jewish immigration from abroad mainly from eastern europe took place during the british mandate the future of palestine was hotly disputed between arabs and jews in 1947 the total jewish ownership of land in palestine was 1 850 000 dunums or 1 850 square kilometers which is 7 04 of the total land of palestine public property or crown lands the bulk of which was in the negev belonging to the government of palestine may have made up as much as 70 of the total land with the arabs christians and others owning the rest the 1947 united nations partition plan proposed a division of the mandated territory between an arab and a jewish state with jerusalem and the surrounding area to be a corpus separatum under a special international regime the regions allotted to the proposed arab state included what would become the gaza strip and almost all of what would become the west bank as well as other areas jewish groups notably the jewish agency generally supported the partition plan arab groups all arab countries in the u n voted against it generally rejected the partition plan and subsequently invaded the newly formed state of israel starting the israeli war of independence after the war israel controlled many of the areas designated for the arab state and the negotiated agreements established armistice demarcation lines adls which did not have the status of recognised international borders thus the areas held by jordanian and iraqi forces with minor adjustments came under jordanian control and became known as the west bank of the jordan river by contrast with the east bank or jordan proper the area held by egyptian forces along the mediterranean coast in the vicinity of the city of gaza and south to the international border remained under egyptian control and became known as the gaza strip for nineteen years following the 1949 armistice agreements until the 1967 six day war egypt occupied the gaza strip and jordan occupied the west bank and east jerusalem and no arab state was created in 1950 jordan annexed the territories it occupied this annexation was not officially recognized by other countries with the sole exception of the united kingdom but not as is often said pakistan the article 24 of the palestinian national charter of 1964 stated this organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the west bank in the hashemite kingdom of jordan on the gaza strip or in the himmah area israel captured both territories in the 1967 six day war since then they have been under israeli control after the war un security council resolution 242 introduced the land for peace formula for normalizing relations between israel and its neighbors the oslo accords of the early 1990 s between the palestine liberation organization and israel led to the creation of the palestinian authority this was an interim organization created to administer a limited form of palestinian self governance in the territories for a period of five years during which final status negotiations would take place the palestinian authority carried civil responsibility in some rural areas as well as security responsibility in the major cities of the west bank and the gaza strip although the five year interim period expired in 1999 the final status agreement has yet to be concluded despite attempts such as the 2000 camp david summit the taba summit and the unofficial geneva accords in 2005 israeli forces withdrew from the gaza strip ceding full effective internal control of the territory to the palestinian authority legal status see related articles international law and the arab israeli conflict political status of the west bank and gaza strip status of territories captured by israel the final status of the palestinian territories as becoming wholly or largely an independent state for arabs is supported by the countries that back the quartet s road map for peace the government of israel also accepted the road map but with 14 reservations although israeli settlements were not part of the oslo accords negotiations the arab position is that the creation and the presence of israeli settlements in those areas is a violation of international law this has also been affirmed by a majority of members of the geneva convention 12 the participating high contracting parties call upon the occupying power to fully and effectively respect the fourth geneva convention in the occupied palestinian territory including east jerusalem and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the convention they reaffirm the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof they recall the need to safeguard and guarantee the rights and access of all inhabitants to the holy places east jerusalem captured in 1967 was unilaterally annexed by israel the un security council resolution 478 condemned the jerusalem law as a violation of international law this annexation has not been recognized by other nations although the united states congress has declared its intention to recognize the annexation a proposal that has been condemned by other states and organizations because of the question of jerusalem s status some states refuse to accept jerusalem as the capital of israel and treat tel aviv as the capital basing their diplomatic missions there israel asserts that these territories are not currently claimed by any other state and that israel has the right to control them israel s position has not been officially accepted by most countries and international bodies the west bank and the gaza strip have been referred to as occupied

international court of justice and the israeli supreme court see israeli west bank barrier the united nations did not declare any change in the status of the territories as of the creation of the palestinian national authority between 1993 and 2000 although a 1999 u n document see the link above implied that the chance for a change in that status was slim at that period most observers agreed that the palestinian territories classification as occupied was losing substantiality and would be withdrawn after the signing of a permanent peace agreement between israel and the palestinians see also proposals for a palestinian state during the period between the 1993 oslo accords and the second intifada beginning in 2000 israeli officials claimed that the term occupation did not accurately reflect the state of affairs in the territories during this time the palestinian population in large parts of the territories had a large degree of autonomy and only limited exposure to the idf except when seeking to move between different areas following the events of the second intifada and in particular operation defensive shield most territories including palestinian cities area a are back under effective israeli military control so the discussion along those lines is largely moot in the summer of 2005 israel implemented its unilateral disengagement plan about 8500 israeli citizens living in the gaza strip were forcibly removed from the territory some received alternative homes and a sum of money the israeli defence forces vacated gaza in 2005 but invaded it again in 2006 in

effect but borger still struggled with lawlessness and violence into the 1930s climaxing with the murder of district attorney john a holmes by an assassin on september 18 1929 this event caused

institute at pusa took krishnan to his father in law for advice krishnan was told that unless he managed to do well in studies he could not be helped writing for a while he made a living by writing to small magazines and publishing some of his drawings and caricatures he initially wrote in several tamil magazines in 1942 he was offered employment by the maharaja of sandur near bellary in karnataka

krishnan was an ecological patriot in that he opposed the introduction of exotic trees he was once asked to speak at the indian institute of science at bangalore and in late february the tabebuia trees were ablaze in flowers asked about his opinion on the flowers he declared it as disgraceful and suggested that you should uproot all those foreign trees and plant some of our own krishnan was responsible for the declaration of vedanthangal as a bird sanctuary he was aware that he was different from most conservationists of his time who were either european or were from the indian aristocracy of muslims and rajputs often former hunters in being a vegetarian it has been noted that in 1972 krishnan foresaw the possibility that elephants could communicate using sounds that were inaudible to the human ear this infrasound communication was confirmed by later studies by katherine payne photography along with his whimsical prose poetry and drawing he used photography as another tool for expression he worked only with black and white film his equipment was according to naturalist e p gee a large composite affair with the body of one make and a tele lens of another and other parts and accessories all ingeniously mounted together by himself i cannot swear that i saw proverbial bootlace used to fix them all together but i am sure there must have been some wire and hoop somewhere he called his equipment the super ponderosa krishnan was a not a big fan of technological advances and was unimpressed by the display of india s first jet aircraft he declared them as mechanical chemical and inhuman and was impressed more by the living muscular speed of animals and if you want to see something sustained in its effortless rhythmic impetuosity you should watch a herd of blackbuck going all out for a few miles there is tangible real speed for you philosophy krishnan was unhappy with the indian system of school education in a 1947 essay he wrote the average educated adult knows little or nothing of the teeming plant and animal life of the country and cares less livestock does not interest him and the world is to him a place which holds only human beings he can never make friends with a hill or a dog and if he has no one to talk to no book to read and no gadget to turn and unturn he is quite lost school education is solidly to blame for all this in 1967 he asked several university graduates to name two red flowered tree or an exclusively indian animal nobody passed his test and he wrote is there something radically wrong with the education and culture of our young men and women that they should not know the answers to these reasonable questions or is it that i have become a monomaniac and am therefore unable to perceive how unfair my questions are writing about the indian consciousness of nature he wrote the public both literate and unlettered has no interest in the great national heritage of wildlife of which it knows little and for which it cares less he refused a paid invitation from air india for a trip to london for eminent indians he refused on another occasion an invitation from the smithsonian institution he was a fierce individualist and a recluse author ramachandra guha called him a self reliant thoreauvian individualist who would not allow a mere government to pay for him he however accepted the padma shri from the indian government in 1969 in some of his writings he was critical and opinionated and was not well known for his diplomacy he would refuse to let editors change his texts and that was his condition

 id=827477 title k street washington d c nonfiltered 577 processed 572 dbindex 450582 k street is a major thoroughfare in the united states capital of washington d c known for the numerous think tanks lobbyists and advocacy groups that exercise influence from this location location in the city there are two separate roads designated k street in washington d c they are east west streets in d c s northern half and southern half when not being qualified k street almost always refers to the northern k street as it is the more famous of the two the northern k street has its western starting point as k st n w just west of the abutment of the old aqueduct bridge in the southern part of georgetown in the city s northwestern quadrant the georgetown section of k street was called water street until the georgetown street renaming of 1895 west of 33rd street the united states postal service still recognizes both k street and water street in addresses the road crosses rock creek and enters the area surrounding farragut square park where it is exceptionally wide due to parallel service lanes described below farther east the street eventually changes designation from k st n w to k st n e after intersecting north capitol street the boundary between the washington s northwestern and northeastern quadrants this k street s eastern end is at florida avenue in the near northeast neighborhood just south of gallaudet university in alignment with the city s cartesian coordinate based street system there is another k street in its southern half this one running between the potomac river at the western edge of the southwestern quadrant as k st s w to the anacostia river at the eastern edge of the southeastern quadrant as k st s e traffic configuration current k street provides a major east west thoroughfare for traffic through washington primarily from mount vernon square location of the new washington convention center to the whitehurst freeway k street also runs through georgetown under the whitehurst freeway however most westbound traffic exits to the freeway a segment of u s highway 29 runs along k street k street also runs as a tunnel underneath washington circle allowing traffic to avoid the circle which is an intersection with 23rd st pennsylvania ave and new hampshire ave service roadways and main roadway portions of the street in both directions are divided into both local or service lanes and express lanes allowing through traffic to hopefully travel more smoothly across town however since that division of traffic lanes is universally acknowledged to be a failure local officials have proposed to remove the barriers to make room for a busway see next section proposed because of k street s standing as a major thoroughfare the washington metropolitan area transit authority the local transit authority has been studying k street and has considered turning it into a busway the scope of the project would be to have the busway run from georgetown university across downtown washington on k street switching to massachusetts avenue at mount vernon square and finishing at union station the dc circulator east west route provides service along most of that route although the dc circulator must share right of way with other vehicles lobbying k street is a common metonym for washington s lobbying industry many of the major washington lobbying firms are located on the section which passes from georgetown through a portion of downtown d c this part of the street is sometimes referred to as the fourth branch of government lobbying firms are thought to have great influence in u s national politics due to monetary resources and the revolving door policy of hiring former government officials k street firms often hire ex politicians from both major parties since the party in power can vary between elections and among the legislative and executive branches in government the k street project according to former washington monthly editor nicholas confessore is an attempt to build a new republican political machine built upon patronage contracts and one party rule among washington s thousands of trade associations and corporate offices their tens of thousands of employees and the hundreds of millions of dollars in political money at their disposal the theory behind the project confessore wrote boils down to this as republicans control more and more k street jobs they will reap more and more k street money which will help them win larger and larger majorities on the hill the jack abramoff indian lobbying scandal which contributed to the slippage of republicans into minority status in both houses of congress in the 2006 midterm elections has called the future of the k street project into question k street in the media the associated press washington bureau and the ap broadcast news center are situated on k street the street also inspired a television series on the hbo network by the same name k street references

become a major market for foreign women who are coaxed and forcibly brought to the country by international mafia to work as sex slaves especially in big and touristic cities freedom of expression article 26 of the constitution guarantees the freedom of expression however there have been particular concerns over the restrictions on the publication and diffusion of material relating primarily to highly sensitive political subjects according to the writers advocacy group international pen roughly 60 writers publishers and journalists have been brought charged under the 301st article of the turkish penal code that states a person who publicly insults being a turk the republic or the turkish grand national assembly shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months to three years even though certain high profile cases such as orhan pamuk or elif afak both about assertions related to the armenian genocide an event that is disputed by turkey have ended in acquittals the outcome of other cases are unclear turkish armenian journalist hrant dink was convicted under article 301 and given a suspended 6 month sentence shortly before being assassinated on january 19 2007 freedom of the press articles 27 and 28 of the turkish constitution guarantee the freedom of expression and unhindered dissemination of thought however alinea 2 of article 27 affirms that the right to disseminate shall not be exercised for the purpose of changing the provisions of articles 1 2 and 3 of constitution articles in question referring to the unitary secular democratic and republican nature of the state since the liberalization of the audiovisual market in 1991 turkey has developed an extremely vibrant and dynamic media there are thousands of newspapers tv channels and radio stations in the country and they are guaranteed freedom in their editorial decisions by the constitution the state owned trt has been broadcasting short programmes in a number of minority languages including bosnian and kurdish since 2003 for the kurdish language programmes this is rather symbolic in terms of the number of minutes of programmes per week nevertheless it has been claimed that the turkish authorities appear to interpret this freedom in a more restrictive way compared to other modern secular states of the european union and north america all independent observers note that even though the non turkish media enjoys the same freedom as their turkish counterparts this is not true for media in kurdish press freedom groups have raised concerns over the use of criminal defamation laws to punish those who criticise authorities freedom of conscience although its population is overwhelmingly muslim turkey is a secular country per article 3 of its constitution and thus has no official religion secularism in turkey originates from atatürk s six arrows of republicanism populism laïcité reformism nationalism and statism article 24 of the turkish constitution guarantees all residents of turkey the right to adhere to any religion or philosophical belief with some exceptions made for their expression in public spaces the constitutional court has interpreted secularism in a way that doesn t allow for a person to wear religious symbols e g a head scarf or a cross in governmental and public institutions and particularly while attending schools and universities nevertheless it must be noted that in its decision on november 10 2005 the grand chamber of the european court of human rights ruled that such a ban was legitimate to prevent the influence of religion in state affairs conforming with the jurisprudence of the constitutional court and the council of state on secularism faith based schools are banned and all schools must follow a secular curriculum religious education may only be given by appointed teachers who have studied at turkey s secular universities in practice only sunni theology is taught there is a de facto domination of sunni school of islam within turkish society despite the protections offered by formal secularism sunni imams are nominated and paid by the state directorate of religious affairs the alevis pray in cemevis but the government funds only the building of mosques even though there have been attempts to expand state religious funding to alevites they are not considered a different muslim school but as part of the sunni branch the situation of the non muslim minorities has also been open to criticism the government doesn t nominate nor pay for any non muslim religious leaders however it must be noted that most of these minorities prefer electing their own spiritual leaders and would be equally offended if the state were to do so for them turkey has been criticized by greece the european union and several human rights ngos for its refusal to recognize the ecumenical title of the greek orthodox patriarch in istanbul and the closing of the greek orthodox theological school in heybeliada halki istanbul gay rights homosexual sexual relationships between consenting adults in private is not a crime in turkey the age of consent for both heterosexual and homosexual sex is eighteen on the other hand the criminal code has vaguely worded prohibitions on public exhibitionism and offenses against public morality that are sometimes used to discriminate against the lgbt community as of 2006 turkey neither has a law permitting homosexuals to get married nor does it have a law against the discrimination of turkey s lgbt community disabled citizens in recent years the turkish parliament has approved certain major laws to fight against and end discrimination against the disabled however this has not shown the desired effects on the ground because of a lack of economic resources and the absence of awareness programs in one particular case mental disability rights international mdri an advocacy group for people with mental disabilities has criticized the treatment of the mentally ill in a report called behind closed doors human rights abuses in the psychiatric facilities orphanages and rehabilitation centers of turkey as a result of this criticism turkey s largest psychiatric hospital the bak rköy state hospital in istanbul has announced that it has abolished the use of unmodified ect procedures conscientious objectors the issue of conscientious objectors is highly controversial in the country turkey and azerbaijan are the only members of the council of europe that refuse to recognize the right to conscientious objection in january 2006 the european court of human rights ruled that turkey had violated article 3 of the european convention on human rights that prohibits degrading treatment in a case dealing with conscientious objection another conscientious objector mehmet tarhan was sentenced to four years in prison by a military court in 2005 for refusing to do his military service but he was later released in march 2006 in a related case journalist perihan ma den was tried by a turkish court for supporting tarhan and advocating conscientious objection as a human right but she was acquitted group rights ethnic groups turkish society contains elements from every nationality of the ottoman empire some turks are descended from non turkic ottoman nationalities who adopted a turkish identity and some of them also see themselves as still belonging to one of those minority groups often as a sub group within the main turkish society according to the article 66 of the turkish constitution everyone bound to the turkish state through the bond of citizenship is a turk the constitution affirms the principal of the indivisibility of the turkish nation and of constitutional citizenship that is not based on ethnicity consequently turkish refers to all citizens of turkey it considers that since all turkish citizens have the same rights and benefits of citizenship there is no such nomenclature as minority in turkey except for the three minorities recognized by the treaty of lausanne signed before the proclamation of the republic greek armenian and jewish minorities until recent reforms there were many legal restrictions on publishing in languages other than the only official one turkish and publications in minority languages were not allowed since then minorities have the right to publish and diffuse media such as newspapers or audiovisual channels in their own languages and operate private courses that teach any language spoken in turkey turkish is still the only language that can be used in schools and universities as a first language there have been certain calls by certain ngos that turkey should adopt the definitions of the european charter for regional or minority languages if turkey were to become a signatory to this treaty it would have to accept and subsidise the education of minorities in their own first languages and that for at least all the period of mandatory education however it must be noted that even france a founding member of the european union has refused to apply this treaty within its territory following a ruling by its own constitutional court that has affirmed that doing so would be contrary to the principle of the indivisibility of the republic and the nation affirmed in the first article of the french constitution in addition to france many other eu countries namely belgium czech republic estonia greece ireland italy latvia lithuania malta poland and portugal have also refused to ratify this treaty to this day only 21 member states of the council of europe out of 49 have proceeded with ratification kurdish people during the 1980s and 1990s turkey displaced a big number of its citizens in southeastern anatolia from rural areas allegedly to protect them from guerilla violence of the kurdistan workers party pkk that is considered as a terrorist organization by the us the european union and many other states turkey has claimed that the actions of the turkish armed forces taf included burning of deserted villages in order for the pkk not to use them as outposts or hiding places clashes between turkish and pkk militants have resulted in some 30 000 casualties according a report by the estimates suggest that 3 million people remain internally displaced and unable to return to their villages it has been claimed that the scale and importance of those bombings and of the displacements of civil population were out of proportion for a state s peaceful policy towards its citizens in several of its rulings the european court of human rights has condemned turkey of human rights violations against its citizens of kurdish origin certain academics have claimed that successive turkish governments adopted a sustained genocide program against kurds aimed at their assimilation desmond fernandes a senior lecturer at de montfort university breaks down the policy of the turkish authorities into the following categories forced assimilation program which involved inter alia a ban of the kurdish language and the forced relocation of kurds to non kurdish areas of turkey the banning any organizations opposed to category one the violent repression of any kurdish resistance the genocide theory remains however a minority view among historians and is not endorsed by any nation or major organisation workers rights the constitution affirms the right of workers to form labor unions without obtaining permission and to possess the right to become a member of a union and to freely withdraw from membership article 51 articles 53 and 54 affirm the right of workers to bargain collectively and to strike respectively however rates of membership in labor unions are quite low due to the fact that turkish economy still experiences difficulties with corruption and massive numbers of workers not declared to the social security turkey has had a standard state run pensions system based on european models since the 1930s furthermore since 1996 turkey has a state run unemployment insurance system obligatory for all declared workers international criticism turkey has been criticized by a number of international human rights ngos for its violations of certain rights of its citizens the european union has been the biggest critic of turkey s human rights record and this has hindered turkey s accession process to join the eu the european court of human rights has also issued many rulings highly critical of turkey s human rights record and other ngos such as the amnesty international and the human rights watch have also been critical of turkey the current akp led government has tried on certain occasions but failed to strengthen legal provisions that are more restrictive such as making adultery a criminal offence that is in line with orthodox islamic teaching proponents of the proposal however claimed that the law in question would have prevented the practice of polygamy which can still be encountered in remote rural areas in any case in the light of the recent jurisprudence of the constitutional court that had struck down a similar provision for being unconstitutional in 1992 all jurists agree that it would have done so again even if it were

 id=2082947 title wiccan comics nonfiltered 615 processed 610 dbindex 450620 wiccan billy kaplan is a fictional character and member of the young avengers a team of superheroes in the marvel universe his appearance is patterned on that of thor and scarlet witch he first appeared in young avengers 1 april 2005 the issue was scripted by allan heinberg and drawn by jim cheung fictional character history billy kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to cardiologist jeff kaplan and psychologist rebecca kaplan regularly bullied in school billy found solace outside the gates of the avengers mansion one day billy encountered the avenger the scarlet witch who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens she then touched his head causing a red light to flash briefly the flash heals billy s wounds and a few weeks later he stands up for another kid being bullied and demonstrates his powers for the first time but is not fully prepared for their effects young avengers he was one of the young avengers chosen as a result of the vision s plan for the reformation of the avengers in the event the team ever disbanded he originally chose the code name asgardian the full extent of his powers are unknown though they include flight and lightning generation in young avengers 5 it is revealed that he can cast spells using a technique learned from self help books owned by fellow young avenger hulkling s mother by chanting a mantra statement of intent for example i want iron lad to forget and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve he can cause different events and effects to happen the team was then told to disband by captain america the young avengers decided to ignore him kate bishop told billy that he should change his codename to avoid the obvious puns when the press discovers that he s in a relationship with hulkling kate along with stature suggested the codename wiccan billy smiling replied that he doesn t hate it parentage billy has said that wanda maximoff the scarlet witch was his favorite avenger and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers in young avengers 11 billy s possible relationship to wanda was revealed by the super skrull and vision in the past scarlet witch was so desperate to have children that she used her reality warping powers to create twin sons out of fragments of the soul of the demon mephisto when the boys souls were reabsorbed into mephisto they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as thomas shepard the young avenger speed and billy heinberg stated on the situation in a transcript with fans according to billy s theory the souls of wanda s twins inhabited his and tommy s bodies when they were dispersed from mephisto but it s only a theory he also stated in another interview that his plans for the new season involved the two searching for wanda stating if everything goes according to plan wanda will indeed return to young avengers early in season two when billy and tommy embark on a search for the true source of their powers much conjecture has been made as to their appearance and powers the theory that they are indeed wanda s children is strongly supported in the comics by the super skrull s statements and vision s files billy believes himself to be wanda s son however tommy has been more skeptical about the situation the official marvel website however lists scarlet witch and vision as wiccan s parents with his family as his adopted parents implying he and tommy are biologically or spiritually still wanda s sons civil war in marvel s 2006 crossover event civil war billy and tommy plan to look for wanda they hope that revelation that her sons appear to be alive and well will aid in her recovery however their plan is disrupted by the attack by the zodiac on the united nations and the subsequent events of the civil war s h i e l d arrests the young avengers however sam wilson falcon and steve rogers captain america intercept the s h i e l d bus which is transporting the prisoners and wiccan teleports the team out of the situation into the resistance fighters base of operations wiccan also takes part in the first major battle of the civil war and was one of the first two casualties tony stark and peter parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush so wiccan and cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious a violent battle ensues by the end of which goliath lies dead most of the anti registration group escapes but wiccan is left behind and captured by the pro registration side billy and the other imprisoned anti registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by captain america this liberation is made possible largely by teddy s shape shifting ability which allows him to mimic hank pym s retinal and voice patterns and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells wiccan also plays a major role in the side story civil war young avengers runaways which apparently takes place between the 2nd and 3rd issues of the main civil war narrative the runaways try to stay out of the conflict but they barely manage to escape from the government forces hearing of this development in the news the young avengers decide to help the runaways even though captain america vetoes the plan wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the runaways however the runaways believe that the young avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until eli patriot succeeds in convincing nico to stop the hostilities the two teams are later attacked by noh varr who captures wiccan and hulkling and apparently kills the runaway xavin the young heroes become the prisoners of the warden who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious teddy this has little physical effect on hulkling whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the warden s knife but it does have a strong psychological effect on billy who cries out i want you to die he is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred the boys are rescued by xavin whose skrull physiology allowed him to recover from noh varr s attack he comes close to killing the warden but teddy stops him from becoming a murderer relationships exchanges between wiccan and hulkling had led some readers to speculate that the two young men had a much more intimate bond than mere friendship allan heinberg confirmed this speculation stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship in issue 12 and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly in 6 kate advises that asgardian should change his codename to avoid the obvious puns when the press discovers that he s in a relationship with hulkling implying that the others already know the two are gay in young avengers special the team agrees to give an interview to kat farrell and jessica jones warns billy and teddy that farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true after some deliberation the two decide to tell her with teddy adding why should northstar have all the fun powers and abilities as wiccan billy kaplan possesses a spellcasting talent that may or may not be related to a reality warping power while patterning himself after thor in the guise of asgardian billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning based spells by stating an intent and focusing on the outcome wiccan is capable of a variety of feats including but not limited to tracking and locating others illusionary disguises tearing down forcefields mass teleportation concussive blasts enchantments and telekinetic force beams it was revealed in civil war young avengers runaways that billy must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful trivia allan heinberg has stated that billy and his family are reform jews asked about billy s codename heinberg said it turns out that code names are the trickiest part of creating new characters when kate suggests wiccan to billy in young avengers 6 she like me was not thinking in terms of the specific religious practice of wicca but rather attempting to find a suitable counterpart for the word witch it was certainly not my intention to offend anyone with wiccan and since adopting the code name rest assured billy has been doing his wiccan homework so keep reading notes external link gay

may 1942 during the second world war the mutineers were to seize control of the islands disable the british garrison and to transfer the islands to the empire of japan however the mutiny was defeated after the sri lankans failed to seize control of the islands many mutineers were punished and the three ringleaders were executed they were the only commonwealth servicemen to be executed for mutiny during the second world war background units belonging to the ceylon defence force cdf including the ceylon garrison artillery cga the ceylon light infantry cli and the ceylon volunteer medical corps were mobilised on 2 september the day before britain declared war on nazi germany the cga was equipped with six inch 152 mm and nine inch 227 mm guns several of them were posted to the seychelles and the cocos islands accompanied by contingents of the cli and the medical corps the fall of singapore and the subsequent sinking of prince of wales and repulse punctured forever the myth of british invincibility whatever remained was ripped to tatters by the sinking of the aircraft carrier hermes and the cruisers cornwall and dorsetshire off sri lanka in early april 1942 accompanied at the same time by the virtually unopposed bombing of the island and bombardment of madras the feelings of the sri lankan troops had been excited by the work carried out by the pro independence lanka sama samaja party lssp both before and during the war they had volunteered to fight the racism of the fascists and had found institutionalised racism in their own regiments even the burghers who were of european ancestry found themselves discriminated against with the japanese successes public sentiment on ceylon turned in favour of the japanese being unaware of the fate that befell japan s east asian conquest many sri lankans thought that the japanese would serve as liberators at this time j r jayawardene later to be president of sri lanka held discussions with the japanese with this aim in mind mutiny indian troops who made up the majority of the garrison on christmas island rose up against the british troops and killed them in march 1942 before surrendering to the invading japanese the ceylon garrison artillery on horsburgh island in the cocos islands mutinied on the night of 8 9 may intending to hand the islands over to the japanese the plan was to arrest captain gardiner the british battery commanding officer and his second in command to disarm the troops loyal to the british empire to turn the 6 inch guns on the cli troops on direction island and to signal the japanese on christmas island however the soldiers all proved to be poor shots with small arms one soldier was killed and another wounded the rebels one bren gun jammed at a crucial moment when gratien fernando the leader of the mutiny had it trained on gardiner the rebels then attempted to turn the 6 inch guns on direction island but were overpowered messages sent by fernando were received in sri lanka indicating that there was co operation between him and the both cli troops and the australian signallers on direction island he declared he had surrendered on condition that he would be tried in colombo it may be that he intended to give a speech from the dock to inspire his compatriots however the rebels were court martialled on the cocos islands fernando was defiant to the end confidently believing that he would be remembered as a patriot and refused a commutation of punishment he was executed on 5 august 1942 at welikada prison and two other mutineers shortly thereafter fernando s last words were loyalty to a country under the heel of a white man is disloyalty consequences no sri lankan combat regiment was deployed by the british in a combat situation after the cocos islands mutiny the defences of sri lanka were beefed up to three british army divisions because the island was strategically important holding almost all the british empire s resources of rubber rationing was

 id=1716404 title roman de fauvel nonfiltered 635 processed 630 dbindex 450640 the roman de fauvel translated as the story of the fawn colored beast is a 14th century french poem accredited to french royal clerk gervais du bus though probably best known for its musical arrangement by philippe de vitry in the ars nova style first published in paris in 1314 the piece serves as an allegorical criticism of church and state using the metaphor of a donkey becoming the ruler of his master s house upon a kind whim from dame fortune the poem though banned at the time for being seditious and heretical was wildly successful and still copied into the 15th century twelve manuscripts have survived many of which are in remarkbably good condition owing to the fact that they were stowed away securely due to their illegality following in the literary tradition of the thirteenth century the roman de fauvel is often compared with the roman de la rose the roman de fauvel is laden with allegories and political satire the donkey s name which when broken down forms fau vel or veiled lie also forms an acrostic in which each letter stands for one of the seven deadly sins flaterie flattery avarice greed vilanie guile variété inconstancy envie envy and lacheté cowardice plot fauvel an ambitious but foolish donkey decides that he is unsatisfied with his residence in the stable and moves into the largest room of his master s house upon moving there he changes it to suit his needs and has a custom hayrack built dame fortune the goddess of fate smiles upon fauvel and appoints him leader of the house subsequently church and secular leaders from many places make pilgrimages to see him and bow to him in servitude symbolizing church and state rulers quickly bowing to sin and corruption upon receiving dame fortune s smile fauvel travels to macrocosmos and asks for her hand in marriage she denies him but in her stead she proposes he wed lady vainglory fauvel agrees and the wedding takes place with such guests present as flirtation adultery carnal lust and venus in a technique similar to that of the morality plays of the 15 th and 16 th centuries finally dame fortune reveals that fauvel s role in the world is to give birth to more iniquitious rulers like himself and to be the follower of the antichrist eventually to bring about the end of the world music the musical accompaniment to roman mostly composed by philippe de vitry is usually cited as the beginning of the ars nova movement though most of the pieces are based on plainchant they vary greatly in terms of ornamentation and layering with some being entirely monophonic and other more complex pieces being polyphonic and even sung in multiple languages however the unifying characteristic of roman is the use of the isorhythm which is a rhythmic pattern present in various voices of the piece at various times though through the relative length of the isorhythm and its envolopment in the rest of the music it is usually indiscernable to those not intimately familiar with the music literary and music critics have often claimed that the musical interpolations were chosen entirely randomly paris 1898 langfors 1914 gagnepain 1996 however more recent work has attempted to disprove this hypothesis showing that the additions contributed by the bn146 are part to a larger artistic project with beyond the political message a religious purpose herbelot 1998 interestingly the idea that this manuscript was more than an anthology was proposed back in 1935 by emilie dankh who gave us then a complete edition of the text of the bn146 although the text of the roman de fauvel is not particularly well known the music has been frequently performed and recorded the question of how the entire work would have been read or staged in the 14th century is the subject of academic debate some have suggested that bn146 the copy with additional 3000 verses and 169 musical pieces could have been intended as a theatrical performance dankh herbelot this hypothesis is of course in contradiction with the concurrent opinion that the roman de fauvel is mainly an anthology gagnepain surviving copies the copy designated bn146 is attributed to chaillou de pesstain its particular value resides in the additional 3000 verses and 169 musical pieces which constitute a veritable anthology of thirteenth and early fourteenth century music this includes latin and french liturgical and devotional sacred and profane monophonic and polyphonic chant old and new music the bn146 has often been said to mark

 id=407247 title three marks of existence nonfiltered 655 processed 649 dbindex 450660 according to the buddhist tradition all phenomena dharmas are marked by three characteristics sometimes referred to as the dharma seals that is dukkha suffering anicca impermanence and anatta non self after much meditation the buddha concluded that everything in the physical world plus everything in the phenomenology of psychology is marked by these three characteristics dukkha sanskrit duhkha or unsatisfactoriness nothing found in the physical world or even the psychological realm can bring lasting deep satisfaction anicca sanskrit anitya or impermanence this refers not only to the fact that all conditioned things eventually cease to exist but also that all conditioned things are in a constant state of flux visualize a leaf growing on a tree it dies and falls off the tree but is soon replaced by a new leaf anatta sanskrit anatman impersonality or non self the human personality soul or self is a conventional appellation applied to the assembly of physical and psychological components each individually subject to constant flux there is no central core or essence this is somewhat similar to a bundle theory of mind or soul there is often a fourth dharma seal mentioned nirvana is peace nirvana is the other shore from samsara together the three characteristics of existence are called ti lakkhana in pali or tri laksana in sanskrit by bringing the three or four seals into moment to moment experience through concentrated awareness we are said to achieve wisdom the third of the three higher trainings the way out of samsara in this way we can identify that according to sutra the recipe or formula for leaving samsara is achieved by a deep rooted change to our weltanschauung dukkha whatever is impermanent is subject to change whatever is subject to change is subject to suffering the buddha striving for what we desire we may experience stress and suffering dukkha p li sanskrit du kha getting what we desired we may find delight and happiness soon after the novelty may wear out and we may get bored with it boredom is a form of dissatisfaction or suffering and to escape from it we divert ourselves from such boredom by indulging in a pursuit of new forms of pleasure sometimes not willing to relinquish objects that we are already disinterested in we start to collect and amass possessions instead of sharing with others who may have better use in it than we do boredom is a result of change change of our interest in that object of desire that so captivated us in the first place if we do not get bored already then change may instead occur in the object of desire silverware may become tarnished a new dress worn thin or a gadget gone obsolete or it may become broken causing us to grieve in some cases it may get lost or stolen in some cases we may worry about such losses even before they happen husbands and wives worry about losing their spouses even though their partners are faithful unfortunately sometimes our very worry and fear drives us to act irrationally resulting in distrust and breaking up of the very relationship that we cherished so much while we like changes such as becoming an adult when we are in our teens we dislike the change called aging while we strive for change to become rich we fear the change of retrenchment we are selective in our attitude towards the transient nature of our very existence unfortunately this transient nature is unselective we can try to fight it just as many have tried since beginningless time only to have our efforts washed away through the passages of time as a result we continually experience dissatisfaction or suffering due to the very impermanence of compounded phenomena only in the realm of nirvana so mahayana buddhism insists can true and lasting happiness be found nirvana is the opposite of the conditional the transitory and the painful dukkha so it does not result in disappointment or deterioration of the state of bliss nirvana is the refuge from the otherwise universal tyranny of change and suffering in other schools of buddhism nirvana is not viewed as the goal but merely as a projection from the state of samsara according to these schools samsara confusion and nirvana perfection are two sides of the same coin that must be transcended through diligent practice of meditation anicca p li sanskrit anitya all compounded phenomena things and experiences are inconstant unsteady and impermanent practically everything is made up of parts and is dependent on the right conditions for its existence everything is in constant flux and so conditions and the thing itself is constantly changing things are constantly coming into being and ceasing to be nothing lasts the important point here is that phenomena arise and cease according to complex conditions and not according to our whims and fancy while we have limited ability to effect change to our possessions and surroundings experience tells us that our feeble attempts are no guarantee that the results of our efforts will be to our likings more often than not the results fall short of our expectations in mahayana buddhism a caveat is added one should indeed always meditate on the impermanence and changefulness of compounded structures and phenomena but one must guard against extending this to the realm of nirvana where impermanence holds no sway and eternity alone obtains to see nirvana or the buddha in his ultimate dharmakaya nature as impermanent would be to indulge in perverted dharma and would be seriously to go astray according to the buddha s final mahayana doctrines other schools of buddhism however feel uneasy with such a teaching anatta p li sanskrit an tman in indian philosophy the concept of a self is called tman that is soul or metaphysical self which refers to an unchanging permanent essence conceived by virtue of existence this concept and the related concept of brahman the vedantic monistic ideal which was regarded as an ultimate tman for all beings were indispensable for mainstream indian metaphysics logic and science for all apparent things there had to be an underlying and persistent reality akin to a platonic form the buddha rejected all concepts of tman emphasizing not permanence but changeability he taught that all concepts of a substantial personal self were incorrect and formed in the realm of ignorance however in a number of major mahayana sutras e g the mahaparinirvana sutra the tathagatagarbha sutra the srimala sutra among others the buddha is presented as clarifying this teaching by saying that while the skandhas constituents of the ordinary body and mind are not the self there does truly exist an eternal unchanging blissful buddha essence in all sentient beings which is the uncreated and deathless buddha nature buddha dhatu or true self of the buddha himself this immaculate buddhic self atman is in no way to be construed as a mundane impermanent suffering ego of which it is the diametrical opposite on the other hand this buddha essence or buddha nature is also often explained as the potential for achieving buddhahood rather than an existing phenomenon one can grasp onto as being me or self it is the opposite of a personalised samsaric i or mine the paradox is that as soon as the buddhist practitioner tries to grasp at this inner buddha potency and cling to it as though it were his or her ego writ large it proves elusive it does not exist in the time space conditioned and finite mode in which mundane things are bodied forth it is presented by the buddha in the relevant sutras as ultimately inexplicable primordially present reality itself the living potency for buddhahood inside all beings it is finally revealed in the last of the buddha s mahayana sutras the nirvana sutra not as the circumscribed non self the clinging ego which is indeed anatta anatman but as the ever enduring egoless great self or dharmakaya of the buddha the scriptural evidence of the nik yas and gamas is ambivalent with regard to the buddha s reported views on the existence or otherwise of a permanent self tman atta though he is clearly reported to have criticized many of the heterodox concepts concerning an eternal personal self and to have denied the existence of an eternal self with regards to any of the constituent elements skandha of a being he is nevertheless not reported to have explicitly denied the existence of a non personal permanent self contrary to the popular orthodox view of the buddha s teachings moreover when the buddha predicates an tman anatta with regards to the constituents of a being there is a grammatical ambivalence in the use of the term the most natural interpretation is that he is simply stating that the constituents are not the self rather than the constituents are devoid of self this ambivalence was to prove troublesome to buddhists after the buddha s passing some of the major schools of buddhism that developed subsequently maintained the former interpretation but other influential schools adopted the latter interpretation and took measures to establish their view as the orthodox buddhist position one such proponent of this hard line non self position was the monk nagasena who appears in the questions of king milinda composed during the period of the hellenistic indo greek kingdom of the 2nd and 1st centuries bce in this text nagasena demonstrates the concept of absolute non self by likening human beings to a chariot and challenges the greek king milinda menander to find the essence of the chariot nagasena states that just as a chariot is made up of a number of things none of which are the essence of the chariot in isolation without the other pieces similarly no one part of a person is a permanent entity we can be broken up into five constituents body sensations ideation mental formations and consciousness the consciousness being closest to the permanent idea of self but is ever changing with each new thought according to this viewpoint according to some thinkers both in the east and the west the doctrine of non self may imply that buddhism is a form of nihilism or something similar however as thinkers like nagarjuna have clearly pointed out buddhism is not simply a rejection of the concept of existence or of meaning etc but of the hard and fast distinction between existence and non existence or rather between being and no thingness phenomena are not independent from causes and conditions and do not exist as isolated things as we perceive them to be philosophers such as nagarjuna stress that the lack of a permanent unchanging substantial self in beings and things does not mean that they do not experience growth and decay on the relative level but on the ultimate level of analysis one cannot distinguish an object from its causes and conditions or even object and subject this is an idea appearing relatively recently in western science buddhism thus has much more in common with western empiricism pragmatism anti foundationalism and even poststructuralism than with nihilism in the nik yas the buddha and his disciples are commonly found to ask in question or declare is that which is impermanent subject to change subject to suffering fit to be considered thus this i am this is mine this is my self the question which the buddha posts to his audience is whether compounded phenomena is fit to be considered as self in which the audience agrees that it is unworthy to be considered so and in relinquishing such an attachment to compounded phenomena such a person gives up delight desire and craving for compounded phenomena and is unbounded by its change when completely free from attachments craving or desire to the five aggregates such a person experiences then transcends the very causes of suffering in this way the insight wisdom or prajñ of non self gives rise to cessation of suffering and not an intellectual debate over whether a self exists or not it is by realizing not merely understanding intellectually but making real in one s experience the three marks of conditioned existence that one develops prajñ which is the antidote to the ignorance that lies at the root of all suffering from the tathagatagarbha mahayana perspective which diverges from the theravadin understanding of buddhism however a further step is required if full buddhahood is to be attained not only seeing what is impermanent suffering and non self in the samsaric sphere but equally recognising that which is truly eternal blissful self and pure in the transcendental realm the realm of mahaparinirvana interpretations of the three marks by various schools some buddhist traditions assert that anatta pervades everything and is not limited to personality or soul these traditions assert that nirvana also has the quality of anatta but that nirvana by definition is the cessation of dukkha and anicca in nagarjuna s mmk xxv 19 he says there is not the slightest difference between samsara and nirvana this verse points us to an interesting stress between dukkha and nirvana through an argument based in anatta this specific stress can be seen to be the key to and possibly source for the development of the deity yogas of vajrayana the sutra path enjoins us to identify the entire world internally and externally as samsara a continual churning of suffering that nobody wants to be part of our practice is that of leaving the shores of samsara on the other hand we are told that unconditioned enlightened activity is not actually different from samsara whereas the deity yoga of vajrayana enjoins us to identify the entire world as nirvana a continual play of enlightening activity that everyone wishes to be a part of our practice here is that of arriving at the shores of nirvana at this level the distinction between sutra and vajrayana remain that of view departing vs arriving but basically the practitioner remains involved in undergoing a transformative development to his or her weltanschauung and in this context these practices remain rooted in psychological change grounded in the development of samatha or training in concentration however there are certain practices in tantra which are not solely concerned with psychological change these revolve around the basic idea that it is possible to induce deep levels of concentration through psycho physical methods as a result of special exercises the purpose remains the same to achieve liberating view but the method involves a short cut for the training in samatha see also buddhism endofarticle doc doc

 id=7401066 title hiper nonfiltered 660 processed 654 dbindex 450666 the high power laser energy research facility hiper is an experimental laser driven inertial confinement fusion icf device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the european union starting around 2010 hiper is the first experiment designed specifically to study the fast ignition approach to generating nuclear fusion which uses much smaller lasers than conventional designs yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude this offers a total fusion gain that is much higher than devices like the national ignition facility nif and a reduction in construction costs of about ten times perhaps confusingly a similar icf experimental setup in japan is also known as hiper but this is no longer operational background main article icf mechanism the basic idea of any icf device is to rapidly heat the outer layers of a target normally a small plastic sphere containing a a few milligrams of fusion fuel typically a mix of deuterium and tritium the heat burns the plastic into a plasma which explodes off the surface due to newton s third law the remaining portion of the target is driven inwards eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density the rapid blowoff also creates a shock wave that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel when it meets itself in the center of the fuel the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it if the temperature and density of that small spot is raised high enough fusion reactions will occur the fusion reactions release high energy particles which collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down this heats the fuel further and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel high enough density and temperature this heating process can result in a chain reaction burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction this is a condition known as ignition which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion and the release of significant amounts of energy to date most icf experiments have used lasers to heat the targets calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles as well as creating a suitable shock wave the laser beams must also be focussed evenly across the target s outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core although other drivers have been suggested lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features description in the case of hiper the driver laser system is similar to existing systems like nif but considerably smaller and less powerful the driver consists of a number of beamlines containing amplifiers at one end of the building just prior to firing the glass is pumped to a high energy state with a series of xenon flash tubes causing a population inversion of the neodymium nd atoms in the glass this readies them for amplification via stimulated emission when a small amount of laser light generated externally in a fibre optic is fed into the beamlines the glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam so in order to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity each time gaining more power when this process is complete a pockels cell switches the light out of the cavity from there it is fed into a very long spatial filter to clean up the resulting pulse the filter is effectively a telescope that focuses the beam into a spot some distance away where a small pinhole located at the focal point cuts off any stray light caused by inhomogeneities in the laser beam it is the use of spatial filters that lead to the long beamlines seen in icf laser devices in the case of hiper the filters take up about 50 of the overall length the beam width at exit of the driver system is about 40 cm 40 cm one of the problems encountered in previous experiments notably the shiva laser was that the infrared light provided by the nd glass lasers at 1054 nm couples strongly with the electrons around the target losing a considerable about of energy that would otherwise heat the target itself this is typically addressed through the use of an optical frequency multiplier which can double or triple the frequency of the light into the green or ultraviolet respectively these higher frequencies interact much less strongly with the electrons putting more power into the target hiper will also use a frequency multiplier on its driver but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling the later puts more power into the target but is less efficient converting the light when the amplification process is complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber lying at one end of the building here it is reflected off of a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles since the overall distance from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber is different delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time within about 10 ps the target a fusion fuel pellet about 1 mm in diameter in the case of hiper lies at the center of the chamber hiper differs from most icf devices in that it also includes a second set of lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel the heating pulse needs to be very short about 10 to 20 ps long but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well to solve this problem hiper uses a technique known as chirped pulse amplification cpa here you start with a short pulse of a broad bandwidth multi frequency laser source as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic single frequency source light from this initial pulse is split into different colors using a pair of diffraction gratings and optical delays this stretches the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long the pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal when it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse but because the pulse is now very high power the gratings have to be large approx 1 m and sit in vacuum additionally the individual beams must be lower power overall the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 50 kj each to generate a total of 200 kj whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3 kj to generate a total of 70 kj the precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research fast ignition and hiper in traditional icf devices the driver laser is used to compress the target to very high densities the shock wave created by this process further heats the compressed fuel when it collides in the center of the sphere if the compression is symmetrical enough the increase in temperature can create conditions close to the lawson criterion leading to significant fusion energy production if the resulting fusion rate is high enough the energy released in these reactions will heat the surrounding fuel to similar temperatures causing them to undergo fusion as well in this case known as ignition a significant portion of the fuel will undergo fusion and release large amounts of energy ignition is the basic goal of any fusion device the amount of laser energy needed to effectively compress the targets to ignition conditions has grown rapidly from early estimates in the early days of icf research in the 1970s it was believed that as little as 1 kilojoules kj would suffice and a number of experimental lasers were built in order to reach these power levels when they did a series of problems typically related to the homogeneity of the collapse turned out to seriously disrupt the implosion symmetry and lead to much cooler core temperatures that originally expected through the 1980s the estimated energy required to reach ignition grew into the megajoule range which appeared to make icf impractical for fusion energy production for instance the national ignition facility nif uses about 330 mj of electrical power to pump the driver lasers and in the best case is expected to produce about 20 mj of fusion power output without dramatic gains in output such a device would never be a practical energy source the fast ignition approach attempts to avoid these problems instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range this approach directly heats the fuel this is far more efficient than the shock wave which becomes less important in hiper the compression provided by the driver is good but not nearly that created by larger devices like nif hiper s driver is about 200 kj and produces densities of about 300 g cm³ that s about one third that of nif and about the same as generated by the earlier nova laser of the 1980s for comparison lead is about 11 g cm³ so this still represents a considerable amount of compression notably when one considers the target s interior contained light d t fuel ignition is started by a very short 10 picoseconds ultra high power 70 kj 4 pw laser pulse aimed through a hole in the plasma at the core the light from this pulse interacts with the fuel generating a shower of high energy 3 5 mev relativistic electrons that are driven into the fuel the electrons heat a spot on one side of the dense core and if this heating is localized enough it is expected to drive the area well beyond ignition energies the overall efficiency of this approach is many times that of the conventional approach in the case of nif the laser generates about 4 mj of infrared power to create ignition that releases about 20 mj of energy this corresponds to a fusion gain the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power of about 5 if one uses the baseline assumptions for the current hiper design the two lasers driver and heater produce about 270 kj in total yet generate 25 to 30 mj a gain of about 100 not only does this theoretically outperform nif by a wide margin the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well in terms of power for cost hiper is expected to be about an order of magnitude less expensive than conventional devices like nif compression is already a fairly well understood problem and hiper is primarily interested in exploring the precise physics of the rapid heating process it is not clear how quickly the electrons stop in the fuel load while this is known for matter under normal pressures it s not for the ultra dense conditions of the compressed fuel to work efficiently the electrons should stop in as short a distance as possible in order to release their energy into a small spot and thus raise the temperature energy per unit volume as high as possible how to get the laser light onto that spot is also a matter for further research one approach uses a short pulse from another laser to heat the plasma outside the dense core essentially burning a hole through it and exposing the dense fuel inside this approach will be tested on the omega ep system in the us another approach tested successfully on the gekko xii laser in japan uses a small gold cone that cuts though a small area of the target shell on heating no plasma is created in this area leaving a hole that can be aimed into by shining the laser into the inner surface of the cone hiper is currently planning on using the gold cone approach but will likely study the burning solution as well current status hiper has now completed a preliminary study outlining possible approaches and arguments for its construction if successful which will be known in mid 2007 a three year period of detailed design would start in parallel the hiper project also proposes to build smaller laser systems with higher repetition rates the high powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform and it cannot be fired again until it cools off which takes as long as a day additionally only a very small amount of the flash of white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the nd glass and thus lead to amplification in general only about 1 to 1 5 of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam key to avoiding these problems is replacing the flash lamps with more efficient pumps typically based on laser diodes these are far more efficient at generating light from electricity and thus run much cooler more importantly the light they do generate is fairly monochromatic and can be tuned to frequencies that can be easily absorbed this means that much less power needs to be used to produce any particular amount of laser light further reducing the overall amount of heat being generated the improvement in efficiency can be dramatic existing experimental devices operate at about 10 overall efficiency and it is believed near term devices will improve this as high as 20 hiper proposes to build a demonstrator diode pump system producing 10 kj at 1 hz or 1 kj at 10 hz depending on a design choice yet to be made the best high repetition lasers currently operating are much smaller mercury at livermore is about 70 j halna in japan at 20 j and lucia in france at 100 j hiper s demonstrator would thus be between 10 and 1000 times as powerful as any of these in order to make a practical commercial power generator the high gain of a device like hiper would have to be combined with a high repetition rate laser additional areas of research for post hiper devices include practical methods to carry the heat out of the target chamber for power production protecting the device from the neutron flux generated by the fusion reactions and the production of tritium from this flux in order to produce more fuel for the reactor references hiper a laser fusion facility for europe e mail with dr am mike

that was touted to be a mobile anti aircraft platform as well as a convoy fighter created to intercept enemy bombers at distances beyond the range of single seat fighter interceptors the yfm 1 the designation was for y a prototype f fighter m multiplace was a unique design incorporating many features never before seen in a military aircraft as well as several never seen again utilizing a streamlined futuristic design the bell airacuda appeared to be unlike any other fighters up to that time according to major alexander de seversky s 1942 book victory through air power the bell airacuda represents a great engineering achievement but its designation as convoy fighter is erroneous since that requires different disposition of armament with its maximum firepower directed forward it really offers a preview of an effective long range interceptor fighter a single forward firing m4 37 mm cannon with an accompanying gunner was mounted in a forward compartment in each of the engine nacelles although capable of aiming the cannons the gunner s primary purpose was simply to load them with the 110 rounds of ammunition stored in each nacelle the large crew of five included a fire control officer in the nose who used a sperry autopilot a fire control system originally developed for anti aircraft cannon and an optical sight to aim the weapons this crewmember could also use a periscope mounted below the nose to monitor the rear and hopefully spot enemy fighters coming up in the airacuda s blind spot design flaws the airacuda was plagued with problems from the start the lofty performance estimates were unobtainable as despite the sleek look the heavy airacuda was dragged down literally and was slower than most bombers in the event of interception by enemy fighters the airacuda was not maneuverable enough to dogfight while the meager 600 lb 272 kg bomb load was of little use in the intended fighter bomber role even the centerpiece main 37 mm cannon armament were perilous to use the cannons had a tendency to fill the gun nacelles with smoke whenever fired and additionally fears persisted as to how the gunners would escape in an emergency with the propellers directly behind them an emergency bailout would have required both propellers to be feathered the allison v 1710 13 engines though relatively trouble free in other types had no additional cooling systems like many pusher designs they were prone to overheating on the ground the aircraft had to be towed to and from the runway and could only be started when the airacuda was able to takeoff immediately even in the air it was not uncommon to experience overheating problems although designed for turbo supercharging the first flights were made with v 1710 9 carbureted engines that only delivered 1000 hp 76040 kg each despite the long five ft shaft extensions there were no problems with this feature when the turbos were fitted to the later yfm 1 they were plagued by cranky turbo regulators that backfired continuously an explosion during a september 1939 test flight made it apparent that the teething engine troubles would not be solved easily initial flight testing by lt ben kelsey proved the plane virtually impossible to control on a single engine as the aircraft would go into an immediate spin pitch problems were also encountered and had to be corrected by reducing power test pilot erik shilling described his experiences in a later book destiny a flying tiger s rendezvous with fate as flying the bell airacuda was a new experience for me since it was the first pusher aircraft i d ever flown its handling characteristics were foreign to anything i had ever had my hands on under power it was unstable in pitch but stable with power off while flying straight and level if a correction in pitch was required a forward push on the control resulted in the airplane wanting to pitch over even more pitch control became a matter of continually jockeying the controls however slightly even when the aircraft was in proper trim the same applied if pulling back on the control it would tend to continue pitching up requiring an immediate corrective response the same happened in a turn with power off the bell became stable in pitch this was fortunate because during approach and landing it was very stable and a nice flying airplane the airacuda was also saddled by a complex and temperamental electrical system and was the only aircraft ever built to rely on an independent auxiliary power unit apu to power both engine fuel pumps as well as all aircraft electrical systems systems usually powered by an aircraft s engines were instead powered by the single generator the generator with its own supercharger was located in the belly of the aircraft in the event of a failure and they occurred frequently the crew was instructed to begin immediate emergency restart procedures as the aircraft basically shut down when the apu failed the pilot had no fuel pressure no vacuum no hydraulic pressure no gear no flaps and no engines variants the prototype known as the xfm 1 incorporated a tail wheel side blister ports and a smooth rounded canopy this is the best known and most produced version an updated version called the yfm 1 eliminated the side blisters and added externally mounted radiators and turbo superchargers produced in 1940 the final version designated yfm 1a was slightly larger had more powerful allison engines and incorporated a tricycle landing gear the canopy was redesigned with a flat forward windshield a rearward facing belly gunner s position was also added the resulting aircraft was roughly the size of a douglas b 18 bomber three yfm 1as were produced in 1939 operational service despite these problems one fully operational airacuda squadron was eventually assembled and operated from 1938 until 1940 although due to continuing problems they were mainly hangar queens towards the end of the type s operational life the aircraft were flown primarily for photo opportunities and always accompanied by a chase plane for safety in late 1940 the aircraft were stricken from inventory all 13 airacudas were flown to a training facility located outside chicago where they were used for ground crew instruction before the end of world war ii all airacudas were ignominiously scrapped ending a promising if daunting technological venture

 id=4843220 title crotalus atrox nonfiltered 680 processed 672 dbindex 450686 common names western diamondback rattlesnake western diamond backed rattlesnake more crotalus atrox is a venomous rattlesnake species found in the united states and mexico no subspecies are currently recognized description c atrox is generally colored a shade of dark or light brown its pattern is a distinctive row of large dark diamond shapes edged in yellow trim running down the length of its body the diamonds fade to dark rings around the tail where the distinctive rattle begins a dark stripe edged in yellow runs back from the mouth to the eyes on each side of the head there is no significant difference in appearance between males and females except that males are generally larger they grow to an average length of 4 feet but can reach a maximum length 6 feet though large and bulky in appearance c atrox can strike up to two thirds of its body length that s about a three to four foot striking range for larger specimens it strikes with two large hollow fangs which inject venom into its prey eventually killing it venom is lethal to small animals within minutes the fangs are retractable and replaceable as venomous snakes lose and replace fangs often movement is in a rectili fashion unlike sidewinders diet the diamondback eats small mammals and birds and sometimes other reptiles amphibians fish invertebrates rabbits mice rats gophers sparrows and ground squirrels it eats every two to three weeks and swallows its food whole the food is digested as it passes through the body its annual water consumption is about its body weight in very dry areas it also absorbs water from its prey common names western diamondback rattlesnake western diamond backed rattlesnake adobe snake arizona diamond rattlesnake coon tail desert diamond back desert diamond rattlesnake fierce rattlesnake spitting rattlesnake texan rattlesnake texas diamond back rattlesnake behavior and reproduction western diamondbacks can live for more than twenty years but life expectancy is typically shorter because of hunting and human expansion solitary outside of mating season they are one of the more aggressive species found in north america because they rarely back away from confrontation when threatened they usually coil and shake their rattle to warn an aggressor that it has stumbled upon something dangerous there is suspicion that some rattlesnakes and the diamondback in particular which generally live around populated areas do not rattle as often because it leads to the snake s discovery and consequent destruction however there is little available evidence of this hypothesis c atrox like other desert snakes can go for up to two years without food in the wild a 5 month starvation study showed that the snakes reduced energy expenditures by an average of 80 over the length of the study the snakes also feed from within on energy rich lipid stores the most interesting finding was that the snakes grew during the study indicating that while the snake s mass was shrinking it was putting its resources into skeletal muscles and bone in the winter the snakes will go into small caves to hibernate this is about the only time that they do not want to bite each other they can remember which cave they go to hibernate the western diamondback also isn t very aggressive when they are in the caves the snake is a poor climber and primarily hunts small mammals but will also feed on birds small reptiles and amphibians they hunt or ambush prey at night or early morning using a type of infrared sense prominently found in pit vipers although adult specimens have no natural predators hawks eagles and other snakes can prey on young or adolescent individuals rattlesnakes including c atrox are viviparous gestation period lasts six or seven months and broods average about a dozen young however the young only stay with the mother for a few hours before they set off on their own to hunt and find recluse thus the mortality rate is very high the western diamondback rattlesnake is the most commonly encountered rattlesnake in texas the western diamondback is the longest rattlesnake in the state and one of the two heaviest the other is the timber rattlesnake the record length is over 213 cm 84 in adults found in the wild typically measure between 0 91 1 21 m 3 4 ft its common name does not come unearned a series of diamond shaped blotches runs down the length of its back and each blotch is surrounded by a light border a background coloration of tan or brown surrounds the blotches and the dorsal coloration varies tremendously over its distributional range this rattlesnake can easily be distinguished by its black and white tail which also earns the western diamondback the name coontail also see below its off white belly is usually unmarked its anal scale is undivided and its dorsal scales are extremely keeled often in rows of 25 to 27 near midbody similar species crotalus atrox may be confused with a number of snakes found in texas most of which are non venomous the majority of these snakes however lack the key feature of a rattle found at the end of the tail many snakes including gopher snakes pituophis and hognose snakes heterodon may show an impressive threat display and have similar brown and tan markings but lack the rattles some rattle less snakes such as rat snakes and copperheads may vibrate their tails like all rattlesnakes crotalus atrox has a heat sensing pit between the eye and nostril the dorsal markings of rattlesnakes range from the distinct diamond shaped rhomboid marks in crotalus atrox and the mojave rattlesnake crotalus scutulatus to dorsal blotches in the prairie rattlesnake crotalus viridis and the western massasauga sistrurus catenatus to narrower crossbands extending down the sides of the body in the rock rattlesnake crotalus lepidus the pattern of the western diamondback is most similar to that of the mojave rattlesnake and the prairie rattlesnake the color of the tail is a useful key to discriminate c atrox from most other rattlesnakes in c atrox the tail is completely encircled with white and black bands of equal widths the mojave rattlesnake crotalus scutulatus is the only other texas rattlesnake with such prominent black and white bands around its tail but the white bands are twice as wide as the black bands crotalus scutulatus does have similar dorsal rhomboid markings running the length of its body yet these blotches flatten into bands in the posterior third of the body the diamond markings of c atrox do not flatten into bands adult mojave rattlesnakes usually reach lengths of only about three feet so any very large rattlesnakes are most likely western diamondbacks natural history all rattlesnakes are venomous and therefore potentially dangerous if approached or handled rattlesnakes are not generally aggressive and will most likely flee if given a chance to retreat found from the flatlands and prairies to the rocky hills and low mountains the western diamondback is a key participant in the food web it is an important predator of many small rodents rabbits and birds the western diamondback is in turn preyed upon by a variety of larger mammals and birds such as coyotes foxes and hawks it is primarily a nocturnal animal hunting for its prey on warm summer nights it is however seasonally diurnal moving between hunting sites during the day during the cooler spring and fall months the western diamondback is usually inactive between late october and early march though an occassional rattlesnake may be seen sunning itself on warm winter days mating occurs in the spring and the females give birth they are viviparous to as many as 25 young which may be as long as 30 cm 12 inches in length the young are fully capable of delivering a venomous bite hours after their birth distribution crotalus atrox is found in california arizona new mexico idaho utah oklahoma and texas the western diamondback also has an extensive range in the the northern half of mexico in texas crotalus atrox is found throughout the state save the wettest eastern portions of the state its relative the eastern diamondback crotalus adamanteus is found in eastern louisiana and ranges from there through florida to northa carolina range habitat c atrox is found both in the united states south east california south nevada arizona new mexico texas oklahoma arkansas and in mexico hidalgo habitat surroundings are similar to that of c adamanteus but generally in more arid and rocky country nevertheless they are also good swimmers venom although the venom of the diamondback isn t particularly toxic the size of the snake allows a larger capacity of venom which is released from its two prominent fangs it s not uncommon that only one bite mark from one fang is visible after a strike fangs can break or bend or the bite area may be small causing a miss all pit vipers have the ability to control the flow of venom through their fangs allowing the diamondback to release most of its venom in a single strike though often a pit viper will not release any of its venom the venom capacity combined with the aggressiveness of the snake make it dangerous and lethal and responsible for several recorded deaths most of the toxin released is proteolytic like all other american pit vipers proteolytic venoms are in fact advanced and concentrated fluids that destroy tissues and other cells through intramolecular digestion a few toxic effects include cytotoxic destoys cells hemotoxic destroys red blood cells myotoxic causes paralysis and muscle destruction hemorrhagic causes persistent bleeding smaller amounts of neurotoxins are also present rattlesnakes have the most potent hemotoxic venom of any snake making them one of the most dangerous snakes in the world unlike neurotoxins hemotoxin poisoning becomes quickly apparent the area around the wound swells at a rapid rate discoloration and pain are also experienced shortly after being bitten professional medical attention should be sought immediately especially when the victim is a child the smaller the victim the less time it takes for the poison to spread although it is commonly believed that baby or young rattlesnakes deliver more concentrated venom and are thus more dangerous this idea is not supported by scientific evidence the amount of venom delivered is a much more important indicator of the bite s danger than the venom s concentration and since larger older snakes can deliver much more venom larger rattlesnakes should always be considered more dangerous captivity c atrox is frequently bred in captivity and readily available in the exotic animal trade many color variations are bred including albinos patternless and melanistic they are also heavily collected from the wild frequently being drawn out of their hiding places with gasoline and used in rattlesnake roundups where they are killed for entertainment despite this their population is not considered to be threatened gallery see also rattlesnake list of rattlesnake species and subspecies

violation of the aliens act as well as of the schengen treaty as of 2005 it is not clear if schily intervened further or if not why not 2001 2004 on may 2 2001 embassies worldwide were advised to accept the carnet de touriste travel insurance introduced by helmut kohl s cdu in 1995 these insurance documents covered medical costs incurred abroad as well as any costs resulting from deportation they were accepted in place of a written guarantee by a german citizen to prove that the visa applicant could finance his stay and his return home the german automobile club adac sold between 120 000 and 150 000 of these insurance documents the allianz insurance company sold more than 35 000 and the itrec gmbh company more than 31 000 the ministry of foreign affairs also advised the embassies to accept similar travel insurance documents from the reiseschutz ag owned by private entrepreneur kübler the press claims this played an important role in the smuggling of people into germany the ministry of the interior was informed about this by the federal crime agency bundeskriminalamt in a trial against anatoli barg the cologne criminal court claimed that the volmer s decree the acceptance of travel insurance documents instead of guarantors or proof of credit worthiness and the applications for visas at travel agencies had led to mass human trafficking in the verdict this was called a cold putsch against the law in july 2001 the ministry of foreign affairs prevented applications for visas at travel agencies from october 1 2001 instead of going to a travel agency once more every applicant had to go to the visa department in an embassy however it was assumed that a travel insurance document sufficed as proof of the applicant s credit worthiness from january 29 2002 the ministry of foreign affairs decreed that it was possible to buy and sell travel insurance documents directly in foreign countries it is said in the press that this increased the problems in kiev and that traders sold travel insurance documents for as much as 1 000 on february 8 2002 the german ambassador in kiev reported that the embassy was flooded with applicants proving their credit worthiness with travel insurance documents from april 2003 travel insurance documents were not accepted any longer on october 28 2004 the volmer s decree was revised once more applicants credit worthiness had to be examined 2005 on january 20 2005 the first meeting of the commission of inquiry was held in the german bundestag this commission a kind of judicial hearing was set up with the votes of the opposition parties cdu and csu the cdu was represented by eckart von klaeden it is assumed that joschka fischer will have to make a statement before the commission the exact time is still in discussion on february 12 2005 ludger volmer retired as the speaker for foreign affairs of the green faction in the bundestag after the media criticized his work as a consultant for the company synthesis gmbh which worked for the bundesdruckerei producing identity cards banknotes and other secure documents for the first time in over six years in february 2005 opinion polls did not show joschka fischer in the first place in the popularity vote instead the leading position in the popularity vote went to the christian democratic ministerpräsident premier of lower saxony christian wulff with fischer coming in second on march 22 2005 the media reported that the federal chancellery had been informed about a dispute between otto schily and joschka fischer about visa politics as early as march 2000 it was said that chancellor gerhard schröder himself was not informed on march 26 2005 eckart von klaeden called for joschka fischer to tell the truth before the elections in north rhine westphalia the cdu csu tried to force a statement by fischer if that works a statement by fischer is to be expected in mid april to mid may on march 31 2005 the media reported that fischer would speak before the inquiry commission in mid april earlier than previously expected the testimony of spd minister of the interior otto schily is currently scheduled for june in april 2005 the media reported that there were difficulties in 2004 fischer claimed the difficulties were resolved in mid 2004 eckart von klaeden said on the main german television channel zdf that the commission of inquiry wanted to investigate the differing statement of mr fischer in march 2005 on april 21 the commission of inquiry heard ludger volmer and his predecessor günther pleuger this commission of inquiry hearing duration more than 12 hours was the first such hearing broadcasted by television and was watched by more than 400 000 people the second such hearing was the april 25 hearing of joschka fischer in the commission of inquiry duration 14 hours viewed by 700 000 viewers alone at the phoenix tv network a 10 5 quota fischer said that he is political responsible that many details cannot be remembered by him and that he would have acted earlier if he would have been informed earlier he also told about new monitoring mechanisms implemented in the auswärtiges amt after the hearing members of the cdu csu continued to ask for fischers retirement whereas members of spd and the greens said that fischer performed well and that the cdu csu members in the commission were not able to show evidence for their accusations may 2005 the german ambassador to ukraine said the visa policies of fischer were lax and eased the application of visas he also said that the volmer decree unmotivated the employees at the embassy june 2 2005 the commission of inquiry was adjourned today after a short session of only 30 minutes the commission called an end to the hearing of evidence with the majority of its spd the greens members cdu and fdp on the other hand are likely to appeal to the constitutional court should this matter be dropped permanently some ministers who were due to appear before the commission e g otto schily was summoned for 8 july or others like frank walter steinmeier of the federal chancellory will not be questioned according to today s events apparently the work of the commission is cut short by the widely anticipated call for a general election in late summer most probably on 18 september 2005 june 15 2005 in a provisional ruling today the constitutional court considered the end of the hearings of evidence as mentioned above on june 2 as unconstitutional and ordered the commission of inquiry to continue with its timetable as planned as long as the federal diet isn t dissolved due to the expected call for a snap election later this summer this would mean the cancelled hearings of ministers like mr schily minister of the interior and mr steinmeier minister of state of the federal chancellory will most likely take place after all see also german politics external links joschka fischer with his back against the wall der spiegel 22 february 2005 see der spiegel on

 id=305 title achilles nonfiltered 714 processed 706 dbindex 450720 in greek mythology achilles also akhilleus or achilleus ancient greek was a hero of the trojan war the central character and greatest warrior of homer s iliad which takes for its theme not the war of troy in its entirety but specifically the wrath of achilles he is known for being the most handsome of the heroes assembled at troy as well as the fleetest central to his myth is his relationship with patroclus characterized in different sources as deep friendship or love birth achilles was the son of the mortal peleus king of the myrmidons in phthia southeast thessaly and the sea nymph thetis zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fire bringer prophesied that thetis would bear a son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed to peleus as with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternate version of the above events the tale goes that zeus tried to have an affair with thetis but thetis was so loyal to hera that she coldly rejected him zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal so hera recommended that she marry peleus as he was as near to an immortal as she was ever going to get according to the incomplete poem achilleis written by statius in the first century ad and to no other sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however she forgot to wet the heel she held him by leaving him vulnerable at that spot see achilles heel achilles tendon it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage however no source before statius makes any reference to this invulnerability the same homer in the iliad to the contrary mentions achilles being wounded in book 21 the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelegon challenged achilles by the river scamander he cast two spears at once one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood also in the greek poems in which we can find description of the hero s death kùpria unknown author aithiopis by arctinus of miletus ilias mikrà by lesche of mytilene iliou pèrsis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his invulnerability or his famous heel and in the pictures of that age presenting achilles death the arrow in many cases arrows hit him on the body peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur on mt pelion to be raised achilles in the trojan war the very first two lines of the iliad read rage sing goddess the rage of achilles the son of peleus the destructive rage that brought countless griefs upon the achaeans achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage menis his anger is at some times wavering at other times absolute the humanization of achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the story cycnus of colonae according to traditions related by plutarch and the byzantine scholar john tzetzes once the greek ships arrived in troy achilles fought and killed cycnus of colonae a son of poseidon cycnus was invulnerable except for his head troilus according to dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy while troilus the youngest son of priam and hecuba who some say was fathered by apollo was watering his horses at the lion fountain outside the walls of troy achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty whose loveliness of form was described by ibycus as being like gold thrice refined the youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of apollo achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god s own altar at the time troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday and the legend goes that if troilus had lived to be twenty troy would have been invincible the iliad homer s iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces agamemnon had taken a woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses a priest of apollo begged agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refused and apollo sent a plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless achilles vowed to protect him achilles did so and calchas declared chyrsies must be returned to her father agamemnon consented but then commanded that achilles slave briseis be brought to replace chryseis angry at the dishonor and as he says later because he loved briseis and at the urging of thetis achilles refused to fight or lead his myrmidons alongside the other greek forces as the battle turned against the greeks nestor declared that had agamemnon not angered achilles the trojans would not be winning and urged agamemnon to appease achilles agamemnon agreed and sent odysseus and two other chieftans to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts achilles stubbornly refused and urged the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do eventually however hoping to retain glory despite his absence from the battle achilles prayed to his mother thetis asking her to plead with zeus to allow the trojans to push back the greek forces the trojans led by hector subsequently pushed the greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the greek ships with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction achilles consented to patroclus sometimes considered achilles lover leading the myrmidons into battle though achilles would remain at his camp patroclus succeeded in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but was killed by hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of troy hector versus achilles after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieved over his friend and held many funeral games in his honor his mother thetis came to comfort the distraught achilles she persuaded hephaestus to make new armor for him in place of the armor that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armor included the shield of achilles described in great detail by the poet enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even got in a fight with the river god scamander who became angry that achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed the god tried to drown achilles but was stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself took note of achilles rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack troy itself seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles could defy fate itself as troy was not meant to be destroyed yet finally achilles found his prey achilles chased hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector s favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuaded hector to fight face to face achilles got his vengeance killing hector with a blow to the neck he then tied hector s body to his chariot and dragged it around the battlefield for thirteen days with the assistance of the god hermes priam hector s father went to achilles s tent and convinced achilles to permit him to allow hector his funeral rites the final passage in the iliad is hector s funeral after which the doom of troy is just a matter of time memnon following the death of patroclus achilles s closest companion was nestor s son antilochus when memnon of ethiopia killed antilochus achilles is once again drawn out onto the battlefield to seek revenge the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector is also the son of a goddess like achilles many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the 7th century bc the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors quintus of smyrna gives a short narration of memnon s death penthesilea and the death of achilles achilles after his temporary truce with priam fought and killed the amazonian warrior queen penthesilea as predicted by hector with his dying breath achilles was thereafter killed by paris either by an arrow to the heel according to statius or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting polyxena a princess of troy in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield his bones are mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games are held he was represented in the lost trojan war epic of arctinus of miletus as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the danube see below paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles the fate of achilles armor achilles armor was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax achilles older cousin they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles and the most deserving to receive it odysseus won ajax went mad with grief and vowed to kill his comrades he started killing cattle or sheep thinking in his madness that they were greek soldiers he then killed himself achilles and patroclus achilles relationship with patroclus is a key aspect of his myth its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it is clear that the two heroes have a deep and extremely meaningful friendship but the evidence of a romantic or sexual element is equivocal commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures thus in 5th century bc athens the relationship was commonly interpreted as pederastic contemporary readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non sexual war buddies or as an egalitarian homosexual couple the cult of achilles in antiquity there was an archaic cult of achilles on the white island leuce in the black sea off the modern coasts of romania and ukraine with a temple and an oracle which survived into the roman period in the lost epic aithiopis a continuation of the iliad attributed to arktinus of miletos achilles mother thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to leuce at the mouths of the danube there the achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games pliny s natural history iv 27 1 mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident insula achillis tumulo eius viri clara on the island consecrated to him located at a distance of fifty roman miles from peuce by the danube delta and the temple there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue iii 19 11 ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 but there has been no modern archeology done on the island pomponius mela tells that achilles is buried in the island named achillea between boristhene and ister de situ orbis ii 7 and the greek geographer dionysius periegetus of bithynia who lived at the time of domitian writes that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor orbis descriptio v 541 quoted in densu ianu 1913 the periplus of the euxine sea gives the following details it is said that the goddess thetis raised this island from the sea for her son achilles who dwells there here is his temple and his statue an archaic work this island is not inhabited and goats graze on it not many which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships sacrifice to achilles in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts craters rings and precious stones offered to achilles in gratitude one can still read inscriptions in greek and latin in which achilles is praised and celebrated some of these are worded in patroclus honor because those who wish to be favored by achilles honor patroclus at the same time there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds which look after achilles temple every morning they fly out to sea wet their wings with water and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it and after they finish the sprinkling they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings other people say still more that some of the men who reach this island come here intentionally they bring animals in their ships destined to be sacrificed some of these animals they slaughter others they set free on the island in achilles honor but there are others who are forced to come to this island by sea storms as they have no sacrificial animals but wish to get them from the god of the island himself they consult achilles oracle they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair but in case the oracle denies them permission because there is an oracle here they add something to the price offered and if the oracle refuses again they add something more until at last the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient and then the victim doesn t run away any more but waits willingly to be caught so there is a great quantity of silver there consecrated to the hero as price for the sacrificial victims to some of the people who come to this island achilles appears in dreams to others he would appear even during their navigation if they were not too far away and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships quoted in densu ianu the heroic cult of achilles on leuce island was widespread in antiquity not only along the sealanes of the pontic sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the black sea achilles from leuce island was venerated as pontarches the lord and master of the pontic black sea the protector of sailors and navigation sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice to achilles of leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters achilleion in messenia stephanus byzantinus achilleios in laconia pausanias iii 25 4 nicolae densu ianu densu ianu 1913 even thought he recognized achilles in the name of aquileia and in the north arm of the danube delta the arm of chilia achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over pontos evokes modern rather than archaic sea law leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing pausanias iii 19 13 reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound ammianus marcellinus xxii 8 attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island the cult of achilles in modern times the achilleion in corfu in the region of gastouri to the south of the city of corfu greece empress of austria elisabeth of bavaria also known as sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism the palace naturally was named after achilles achilleion this elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the trojan war the name of achilles achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of akhos grief and laos a people tribe nation etc in other words achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people grief being a theme raised numerous times in the iliad frequently by achilles achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of achilles as the hero of kleos glory usually glory in war laos has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers with this derivation the name would have a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring grief to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership centuries after homer his name was turned into the female form of achillia attested on as the name of a female gladiator fighting amazonia roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology and this seems to reference achilles fight with penthesilea but give it an extra twist of achilles being played by a man other stories about achilles some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hides the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he rapes achilles there fathers a son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father s possible alias according to this story odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly takes up the spear odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the trojan campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women flee in panic achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away in homer s odyssey there is a passage in which odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead this has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted achilles was worshipped as a sea god in many of the greek colonies on the black sea the location of the mythical white island which he was said to inhabit after his death together with many other heroes post homeric literature explores a pederastic interpretation of the love between achilles and patroclus by the fifth and fourth centuries the deep and arguably ambiguous friendship portrayed in homer blossomed into an unequivocal erotic love affair in the works of aeschylus plato and aeschines and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in lycophron s third century alexandra that claim achilles slew troilus in a matter of unrequited love the kings of the epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son alexander the great son of the epiran princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited his tomb while passing troy achilles fought and killed the amazon helene some also said he married medea and that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica in some versions of the myth achilles has a relationship with his captive briseis achilles in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris punctures his heel extant fragments of myrmidons and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play another lost play by aeschylus the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and patroclus only a few lines survive today the tragedian sophocles also wrote a play with achilles as the main character the lovers of achilles only a few fragments survive spoken word myths audio achilles in later art drama achilles is

 id=284525 title chicken run nonfiltered 736 processed 728 dbindex 450742 chicken run is a 2000 stop motion animation film made by the aardman animations studios which produced the oscar winning wallace and gromit films background chicken run tells the humorous story of a band of chickens who seek escape from their coop before their owners the unambitious yet inconveniently oafish and suspicious egg farmer mr tweedy and his greedy overbearing wife make them all into chicken pies the film is an homage to the world war ii prison films of the 1950s and 1960s particularly the great escape stalag 17 and escape of the birdmen but it alludes to numerous other films including braveheart the indiana jones films and star trek stalag 17 and the latter 3 films or film series were all released by paramount pictures currently sister studio to dreamworks after viacom bought the latter in 2005 the star roles in the movie are those of ginger voiced by julia sawalha a hen who has absolute faith that the chickens can fly out of the coop if only they train hard enough and rocky rhodes voiced by mel gibson a rooster whom ginger believes can fly but who keeps the secret of his flightlessness from her for much of the film mrs tweedy voiced by miranda richardson is the nefarious grasping farm wife whose exasperation at low profits from egg sales leads her to reinvent her farm as a chicken pie factory while her husband does all he can to prevent the chickens from as he rightly believes they are escaping the film proved a success with both children and adults and showed that peter lord and nick park had the ability to handle the technical and writing challenges posed by a feature film and thereby serving as a test bed for the 2005 movie outing for wallace and gromit the curse of the were rabbit summary the movie opens in a pow camp like chicken farm in england the farmer mr tweedy is on his watch with his dogs checking the locks while a small group of chickens stealthily attempt to escape from the enclosure unfortunately tweedy catches on and a lone chicken ginger the ringleader is captured and thrown in a coal bin tweedy snarling that no chicken escapes from tweedy s farm the farm is run by malica or possibly melissa tweedy and her suspicious hen pecked husband day and night pass by and the farmer takes the eggs while his nefarious wife checks progress all the while ginger makes new plans to escape which all end in failure the opening credits are made of subsequent failed escape attempts a new day begins and all the chickens stand for roll call while fowler a male rooster babbles on about his old raf days the wife mrs tweedy checks all the chickens marking down the eggs they have laid one chicken edwina hasn t laid any in a week and is taken inside a shed ginger sneaks to see what happens as mrs tweedy swings up an axe and decapitates edwina but the viewers see this only as shadows but the chickens aren t fazed ginger prepares a new plan to go over the fence calling in two rats nick and fetcher to sneak in new stuff inside the house the humans have eaten edwina and mrs tweedy angrily looks over the amount of eggs and wants a new way to make money an ad catches her eye about a giant pie machine with a small cartoon character shouting i m rich mr tweedy is keeping watch outside and suspects the chickens plot but mrs tweedy tells him that all of this ridiculous notion of escaping chickens is all in his head the idea about going over the fence doesn t go well with the other chickens but ginger reminds them about edwina outside a huge blast is heard a rooster flies over the fence and crash lands inside the camp the chickens eagerly hide him and he introduces himself as rocky rhodes a lone free ranger from america this is a double pun on the lone ranger and free range a method of farming husbandry then ginger asks him if he can teach them how to fly but rocky isn t so thrilled at the idea eventually he reconciles when he sees the circus has come back to take him the next day training begins very bizarrely as rocky seems to have no idea what he s doing eventually the day ends without a single chicken making it off the ground a huge poultry products truck appears and unloads vast amounts of equipment mrs tweedy explains the idea to her husband and the farm will now officially become a full automated factory meanwhile mac a scottish chicken who is a bit of an egghead genius looks over her notes and concludes that chickens simply weren t built for flying ginger confronts rocky about their poor progress and mac deduces that they require thrust ginger warns rocky that if they do not see progress the deal is off and they will reveal his presence to the farmers the next morning rocky gets a cable wire and prepares to sling shot the chickens over the fence but that doesn t work out roll call begins and babs a knitting obsessed chicken hasn t laid any eggs focusing more on the flying instead of chopping her mrs tweedy measures her waistline and orders mr tweedy to double their food rations ginger stops them from eating and tells them that the farmers are deliberately fattening them up to kill them all in one stroke to help out for once rocky manages to bring them a radio to cheer them up which leaves the entire coop dancing to the song flip flop fly rocky s bandages fall off and ginger eagerly announces that he can finally show them how to fly tomorrow but before he can tell her he can t really fly the power goes out outside the pie machine has completed construction and mr tweedy brings ginger in as the first victim and rocky breaks her out surviving the innards and sabotaging the machine fowler gives him an raf medal and apologizes for doubting him both ginger and rocky share a tender moment on the roof overlooking the fields the following morning all the chickens eagerly await the flying demonstration ginger goes to wake rocky but he s gone leaving his raf medal she finds a torn piece of rocky s promotional poster and slowly adds it revealing her horror to everyone completed the poster shows a cannon rocky could never fly at all their plans shot and their hopes shattered ginger gives up and denies any chance of escaping the whole farm starts fighting ginger finally asks fowler what the raf is fowler tells them it is the royal air force and shows them pictures of the airplane he flew in filled with hope again the chickens still plan to fly but now by building the huge plane even the rats help out as they pull apart their own huts to build the plane racing against mr tweedy who is rapidly fixing the machine rocky is once again on the open road but stops when he sees a promotional advertisement for mrs tweedy s homemade chicken pies he thinks about the chickens and realizes the error of his ways in the end the chickens finish the plane just as mr tweedy finishes fixing the machine they attack and tie him under one of the houses and finish construction fowler as pilot starts up the plane as all the chickens pedal to start the string engines mrs tweedy attacks ginger and rocky returns at the last moment to help out the plane takes off and all the chickens cheer mrs tweedy manages to grab on and slowly begins climbing up the rope of christmas lights holding an axe in her mouth ginger tries to cut the rope while rocky nick and fetcher throw eggs at mrs tweedy but end up nocking ginger s scissors mrs tweedy covered in egg lifts her axe and the others think she cut off ginger s head what actually happened was she ducked and the rope got cut then ginger who s still holding onto both halves of the rope lets go of the other half and mrs tweedy falls right into the pie machine which explodes covering mrs tweedy in gooey gravy destroying the barn as mr tweedy looks upon the wreckage he reminds her i told you they was organized as mrs tweedy growls at mr tweedy ready to blame him once again the barnhouse door falls down on her at long last the chickens have reached peace in their own small haven mac gives some baby chickens some lessons while fowler tells them some stories ginger has apparently mated with rocky and the rats are still trying to make an egg business trivia edwina the chicken who is killed by the tweedies at the beginning of the film is a reference to politician edwina currie currie was a junior health minister under prime minister margaret thatcher when in 1988 she issued a warning about salmonella in eggs this caused a collapse in the british egg market and currie was forced to resign or get the chop as commentators sometimes refer to ministers who have resigned or been sacked from office the large dogs employed by mrs tweedy to keep the chickens in check may be partially based on those belonging to miranda richardson the actress who played her chicken run was the first feature film in europe to use the digital intermediate process digitally storing and manipulating every frame of the film before recording back to film the sequence in which rocky and ginger are trapped inside mrs tweedy s pie making machine and encounter various mechanical dangers is a parody of the three indiana jones films various cliffhanger dangers and subsequent escapes there was a heavy push by voters to get chicken run nominated for a best picture academy award à la beauty and the beast 1991 its failure to earn the nomination led the next year to the creation of the academy award for best animated feature which shrek also made by dreamworks won the promo title featured on posters for the film c r 1 was spoof of the promo title m i 2 for the film in early versions of the movie ginger had a little brother named nobby but the idea was dropped in order to make the film less cute the reason all the chickens are wearing scarves is to hide the join between the head and the body the scarves hide the seam which is present because the bodies of the chickens are articulated steel frames coated in silicon rubber while the heads are plasticine the propeller of the escape plane is made of road signs sharing names with famous raf bombers of wwii stirling lane lancaster avenue and blenheim place further the model aeroplane is of a moderately successful raf bomber of the early war period the whitley see also nick park aardman animations wallace and gromit

 id=2153281 title dark star nonfiltered 739 processed 731 dbindex 450745 this article is about astronomical objects for other topics please see the dark star disambiguation page a dark star is a theoretical object that obeys the laws of newtonian mechanics and has a surface escape velocity that equals or exceeds the speed of light light emitted at the surface of a dark star might in newtonian mechanics be in such a circumstances be trapped by the star s gravity hence the name einstein s gravitational general theory of relativity incorporated some modifications to newtonian relationships introduced by the special theory of relativity and as a result the physics of these objects is different according to general relativity and later according to quantum mechanics these objects show more extreme behaviour and are not just dark stars but black holes dark star history john michell and dark stars in 1783 john michell wrote a long letter to henry cavendish outlining the expected properties of dark stars published by the royal society in their 1784 volume michell calculated that when a surface whose escape velocity was equal or greater than lightspeed generated light that light would be gravitationally trapped so that the star would not be visible to a distant astronomer michell s idea for calculating the number of such invisible stars anticipated 20th century astronomers work he suggested that since a certain proportion of double star systems might be expected to contain at least one dark star we could search for and catalogue as many double star systems as possible and identify cases where only a single circling star was visible this would then provide some sort of statistical baseline for calculating the amount of other unseen stellar matter that might exist in addition to the visible stars dark stars and gravitational shifts michell also suggested that future astronomers might be able to identify the surface gravity of a distant star by seeing how far the star s light was shifted to the weaker end of the spectrum a precursor of einstein s 1911 gravity shift argument however michell cited newton as saying that blue light was less energetic than red newton thought that more massive particles were associated with bigger wavelengths so michell s predicted spectral shifts were in the wrong direction it is difficult to tell whether michell s careful citing of newton s position on this may have reflected a lack of conviction on michell s part over whether newton was correct or whether it was just academic thoroughness laplace and dark stars a few years later pierre simon laplace also considered the idea of gravitationally cloaked stars in his book system du monde apparently independently of michell later as the wave theory of light became popular he dropped the idea indirect radiation dark stars and black holes both have a surface escape velocity equal or greater than lightspeed and a critical radius of r 2m however the dark star is capable of emitting indirect radiation outward aimed light and matter can leave the r 2m surface briefly before being recaptured and whilst outside the critical surface can interact with other matter or be accelerated free from the star by a chance encounter with other matter a dark star therefore has a rarefied atmosphere of visiting particles and this ghostly halo of matter and light can radiate albeit weakly comparisons differences between a dark star and a black hole a dark star may emit indirect radiation as described above black holes as described by current theories about quantum mechanics emit radiation through a different process hawking radiation first postulated in 1975 the radiation emitted by a dark star depends on its composition and structure hawking radiation by the no hair theorem is generally thought of as depending only on the black hole s mass charge and angular momentum although this black hole information paradox is controversial light is bent differently by a dark star and a black hole because light is massless under newtonian mechanics it could be and was argued that newtonian gravity does not bend light at all if newtonian objects including dark stars do bend light gravitationally they would bend light by an amount of 2m r this is half as much as the bending according to relativistic physics which is 4m r since observations all

world after the metropolitan new york and the royal opera house covent garden london its performance season at the sydney opera house runs for approximately eight months of the year with the remainder of its time spent in the the arts centre in melbourne victoria in 2004 the company gave 226 performances in its subscription seasons in sydney and melbourne attended by more than 294 000 people like most opera companies it is funded by a combination of government money corporate sponsorship private philanthropy and ticket sales the proportion of its revenue from ticket sales is considerably higher than that of most companies approximately 75 as well as the traditional classical repertoire a number of australian operas have been premiered by the company including the recent lindy by moya henderson which is based on the lindy chamberlain case opera australia will be giving the first performances outside america of andre previn s opera a streetcar named desire in its 2007 sydney season the company is perhaps best known internationally for its association with dame joan sutherland one of the most famous sopranos of the 1980s and baz luhrmann s attention grabbing production of puccini s la bohème in the early 1990s by the end of 2004 opera australia provided employment to approximately 1 300 australians ozopera opera australia s education access and development arm presented the la bohème production in victoria northern territory and western australia attended by 13 350 people while ozopera s schools company performed to over 63 500 primary age children in more than 360 performances in urban and regional new south wales and victoria many thousands of australians also experienced the work of their national opera company through television radio video compact disc dvd and the annual free performance of opera in the domain in sydney australian opera company 1956 57 in 1956 the australian opera company was formed in sydney under the auspices of the australian elizabethan theatre trust it commemorated the mozart bicentenary by presenting four mozart operas in all capital cities travelling more than 10 000 kilometres and giving 169 performances a truly national company was in place elizabethan theatre trust opera company 1957 70 by 1957 it changed its name to the elizabethan theatre trust opera company in the years before 1970 the company gave its first regional tour with rossini s the barber of seville using a small chorus and reduced scenery with only a piano accompaniment however by 1963 a permanent nucleus of singers and staff was retained throughout the year and the company had made appearances at regional festivals including adelaide it also was able to establish the first elizabethan trust orchestra for the company by 1967 with additional government aid while not yet appearing with this company joan sutherland then an internationally known australian soprano and her husband richard bonynge the conductor by the mid 1960s helped the cause of opera in general in australia another milestone was a television recording of puccini s tosca for broadcasting this starred internationally known baritone tito gobbi in addition to two australian singers the soprano marie collier and tenor donald smith the australian opera 1970 96 in 1970 the company became known as the australian opera the 1970s saw considerable changes both in administration and location in 1972 edward downes formerly associated with london s royal opera house became musical director and his first new production was the australian premiere of richard strauss s der rosenkavalier at the princess theatre melbourne followed closely by prokofiev s war and peace as the opening night performance of the brand new sydney opera house the sydney opera house as well as quickly becoming a distinctive cultural landmark in that city gave the company a permanent performance home and thus helped to expand its repertoire and develop local audiences audiences were certainly boosted by joan sutherland s performances with the australian opera in offenbach s the tales of hoffmann in addition in the 1974 season three australian works were performed the affair by felix werder lenz by larry sitsky and rites of passage by peter sculthorpe by 1976 richard bonynge had become musical director and he led the company on its first overseas tour to new zealand with verdi s rigoletto and janá ek s jenufa this was followed in 1978 by the first australian opera country tour with orchestra to north western new south wales and queensland during the 1980s after many years of recording performances by the australian opera for television the australian broadcasting corporation abc and the australian opera presented their first live simulcast johann strauss die fledermaus and it was seen by more than two million people over the following years a series of simulcasts reached millions of australian homes on the popular front a big box office success was the appearance of luciano pavarotti and joan sutherland at the concert hall of the sydney opera house with the elizabethan sydney orchestra conducted by richard bonynge this nationally simulcast performance broke box office records for an indoor event in addition several innovative features characterized this period of the 1980s the first esso opera in the park in the sydney domain quickly became an annual event and it is now called opera in the domain typically it attracts almost 100 000 people each year a similar annual outdoor event which attracts more than 25 000 people is held in melbourne the second was the establishment of the esso young artists development program for the australian opera under the direction of soprano cynthia johnston while the third was the australian compositions program launched with a new production of brian howard s metamorphosis also at this time the fourth of these innovative programs began with the national opera workshop established to enable selected australian composers present works in workshop form with artists from the australian opera lastly operaaction the youth education program established a program of events including three youth performances of puccini s madama butterfly and in 1986 winds of the solstice an original youth opera created by 70 students working on libretto music choreography and orchestration and presented at the sydney opera house in 1988 in association with the australian bicentennial authority the company toured brisbane darwin hobart melbourne perth and the national opera workshop in melbourne with the ra project a music theatre work composed with the direct participation from the earliest stages of the singers who performed it and marking director baz luhrmann s first association with the australian opera when she retired from the operatic stage dame joan sutherland gave her farewell performances for the australian opera in 1990 in a production of meyerbeer s les huguenots two years later the company named its major rehearsal studio after dame joan the early 1990s were to see two important changes in the way that the company worked firstly in 1991 with the formation of the artistic associates of the australian opera a body of people was created which comprised some of the most important figures in the australian musical and performing arts world secondly the australian opera and ballet orchestra was integrated with the australian opera to produce a permanent opera and ballet orchestra for the company in its first performances outside australasia in 1994 the company performed britten s a midsummer night s dream at the edinburgh international festival in addition the baz luhrmann production of la bohème was screened over more than 300 north american television stations followed by worldwide video release opera australia 1996 to present opera australia was formed by the merger of the australian opera and the victorian state opera vso companies in 1996 following a major review commissioned by the australian government of the government supported performing arts companies in australia at this time lindy hume then artistic director of the vso was appointed artistic director of ozopera richard gill succeeded her in 2003 it undertook a pilot regional tour of mozart s the magic flute to four states following performances at the adelaide festival ozopera performed the magic flute in the barracks at queenscliff the great hall of parliament house in canberra and in a cinema in mudgee the first few years of the present century saw the retirement of moffatt oxenbould opera australia s artistic director for 15 years and the appointment of simone young as musical director designate she assumed the position fully from 2001 to honour the retiring director the young artists program was renamed the moffatt oxenbould young artists development program by 2003 richard hickox was appointed music director designate which became fully effective from january 2005 late 2005 saw changes yet again with the creation of a new victorian opera in melbourne in november under the direction of richard gill this revived company may result in a reduction of visits of opera australia to melbourne when the company begins its productions however the creation of this new company is not without controversy as the melbourne daily newspaper the age noted on 20 december 2005 clumsy was the word for the tortured machinations of the victorian government s plans to develop a new state opera company victorian opera but finally in november 2005 it was announced that richard gill would be its artistic director the small but very vocal number of those in melbourne s highly charged opera scene will be watching the company closely in an article on 21 december john slavin went on to say the most intriguing opera in town this year was the one that didn t reach the stage it was the battle to establish a state company now that the final curtain has fallen and the new company victorian opera has been established the key question is whether lovers of opera in victoria will be better off the symptom that has caused grief and outrage has been the phantom participation of opera australia in the artistic life of melbourne in 2004 oa brought seven productions to the state theatre down from eight in 2003 including a gilbert and sullivan which is a patent appeal to a wider audience to raise box office takings this year we have again seen seven productions and the new musical director of opera australia richard hickox has announced the 2006 melbourne season in which that slender presence will be maintained at seven productions of which one will be gilbert and sullivan educational outreach in 1977 opera australia s younger parent company victoria state opera vso which itself was established as a successor to the victorian opera company created the schools company which remains a cornerstone of opera australia activity now performing in new south wales and victoria the schools company is administered by ozopera which tours smaller centres and performs in non traditional settings for instance for school groups its music director is richard gill and it is administered from opera australia s melbourne office esso and its successor exxon mobil have sponsored the schools company regularly since 1984 under the direction of soprano

 id=729317 title transmission medicine nonfiltered 760 processed 752 dbindex 450766 in medicine transmission is the passing of a disease from an infected individual or group to a previously uninfected individual or group the microorganisms bacteria and viruses that cause disease may be transmitted from one person to another by one or more of the following means droplet contact coughing or sneezing on another person direct physical contact touching an infected person including sexual contact indirect contact usually by touching soil contamination or a contaminated surface airborne transmission if the microorganism can remain in the air for long periods fecal oral transmission usually from contaminated food or water sources vector borne transmission carried by insects or other animals microorganisms vary widely in the length of time that they can survive outside the human body and so vary in how they are transmitted transmission symptoms and survival in order to survive microorganisms that require human hosts must have a way to be transmitted from one host to another infectious agents are generally specialised for a particular method of transmission taking an example from the respiratory route from an evolutionary perspective a virus or bacteria that causes its host to develop coughing and sneezing symptoms has a great survival advantage it is much more likely to be ejected from one host and carried to another this is also the reason that many microorganisms cause diarrhea routes of transmission droplet contact also known as the respiratory route it is a typical mode of transmission among many infectious agents if an infected person coughs or sneezes on another person the microorganisms suspended in warm moist droplets may enter the body through the nose mouth or eye surfaces diseases that are commonly spread by coughing or sneezing include at least bacterial meningitis chickenpox common cold influenza mumps strep throat tuberculosis measles rubella whooping cough fecal oral transmission direct contact is rare in this route for humans at least more common are the indirect routes foodstuffs or water become contaminated by people not washing their hands before preparing food or untreated sewage being released into a drinking water supply and the people who eat and drink them become infected in developing countries most sewage is discharged into the environment or on cropland as of 2006 even in developed countries there are periodic system failures resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow this is the typical mode of transmission for the infectious agents of at least cholera hepatitis a polio rotavirus salmonellosis sexual transmission this refers to any disease that can be caught during sexual activity with another person including vaginal or anal sex or less commonly through oral sex see below transmission is either directly between surfaces in contact during intercourse the usual route for bacterial infections and those infections causing sores or from secretions semen or the fluid secreted by the excited female which carry infectious agents that get into the partner s blood stream through tiny tears in the penis vagina or rectum this is a more usual route for viruses in this second case anal sex is considerably more hazardous since penis opens more tears in the rectum than the vagina as the vagina is stretchier and more accommodating some diseases transmissible by the sexual route include at least aids chlamydia genital warts gonorrhea hepatitis b syphilis oral sexual transmission sexually transmitted diseases such as hiv and hepatitis b are thought to not normally be transmitted through mouth to mouth contact although it is possible to transmit some stds between the genitals and the mouth during oral sex in the case of hiv this possibility has been established it is also responsible for the increased incidence of herpes simplex virus 1 which is usually responsible for oral infections in genital infections and the increased incidence of the type 2 virus more common genitally in oral infections oral transmission diseases that are transmitted primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as kissing or by indirect contact such as by sharing a drinking glass or a cigarette diseases that are known to be transmissible by kissing or by other direct or indirect oral contact include all of the diseases listed above as transmissible by droplet contact and also at least cytomegalovirus infections herpes simplex virus especially hsv 1 mononucleosis notice these are all forms of herpes virus transmission by direct contact diseases that can be transmitted by direct contact are called contagious contagious is not the same as infectious although all contagious diseases are infectious not all infectious diseases are contagious these diseases can also be transmitted by sharing a towel where the towel is rubbed vigorously on both bodies or items of clothing in close contact with the body socks for example if they are not washed thoroughly between uses for this reason contagious diseases often break out in schools where towels are shared and personal items of clothing accidentally swapped in the changing rooms some diseases that are transmissible by direct contact include athlete s foot impetigo syphilis on rare occasions if an uninfected person touches a chancre warts vertical transmission this is from mother to child often in utero as a result of the incidental exchange of bodily fluids mostly blood during childbirth or rarely through breast milk some diseases that can be transmitted in this way include aids hepatitis b syphilis iatrogenic transmission transmission due to medical procedures such as injection or transplantation of infected material some diseases that can be transmitted iatrogenically include creutzfeldt jakob disease by injection of contaminated human growth hormone mrsa infection is often acquired as a result of a stay in hospital the route of transmission is important to epidemiologists because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio economic cultural and other features for example low personal and food hygiene due to the lack of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal oral route such as cholera differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease for example if it is noted that polio is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries without a clean water supply than in cities with a good plumbing system we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal oral route see

known as a pseudo penis pronunciation the word is pronounced kliht uh rihs in ipa notation or klih tohr ihs the plural forms are clitorises in english and clitorides in latin in slang it is sometimes abbreviated as clit the oed suggests that the pronunciation kly tor ihs is also used in the uk and gives the likely etymology as coming from the greek perhaps derived from the verb to shut development and formation the female clitoris corresponds to homologous parts of the male penis i e embryologically it comes from the same tissue that forms the penis the trigger for forming a penis instead of a clitoris is the action of testosterone in utero see clitoromegaly the organ is formed out of corpus cavernosum a rich collection of capillary tissue with a substantial presence of nerve tissue it contains twice the number of nerve endings as the penis and it is particularly well suited for sexual stimulation the visible portions of the clitoris extend from the front commissure where the edges of the outer lips labia majora meet at the base of the pubic mound to the fourchette and include the glans hood and inner lips labia minora the labia majora are not considered a part of the clitoris the clitoral glans is entirely or partially covered by the clitoral hood or prepuce tissue that is homologous to the foreskin in males in humans the clitoral body then extends several centimeters upwards and to the back before splitting into two arms the clitoral crura shaped like an inverted v these crura extend around and to the interior of the labia majora including external and internal components it is thought the clitoris is similar in size to the penis most of the clitoris is hidden and external stimulation of the entire clitoris can result in a more profound sexual response there is considerable variation among women with regard to how much of the clitoris protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it ranging from complete covered invisibility to full protruding visibility additionally the size of the external clitoral shaft varies greatly it may be smaller than a pencil eraser or larger than a grape recently urologist dr helen o connell discovered that erectile tissue lies beneath the external glans splitting off into two 11 cm legs with more tissue branching down near the vaginal opening one explanation advanced for the vaginal orgasm is that it results from stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration nevertheless some women experience both clitoral and vaginal orgasms and distinguish between them in terms of both the physical and general sensations associated with each and the structure of the g spot located inside the vagina must also be taken into consideration during sexual arousal the clitoris enlarges as its erectile tissue fills with blood shortly before orgasm this erection often increases further drawing the clitoris upwards so that viewed from the outside it actually appears to shrink recognition of existence medical literature first recognised the existence of the clitoris in the 16th century this is the subject of some dispute realdo colombo also known as matteo renaldo colombo was a lecturer in surgery at the university of padua italy and in 1559 he published a book called de re anatomica in which he described the seat of woman s delight colombo concluded since no one has discerned these projections and their workings if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me it should be called the love or sweetness of venus colombo s claim was disputed by his successor at padua gabriele falloppio who discovered the fallopian tube who claimed that he was the first to discover the clitoris caspar bartholin a 17th century danish anatomist dismissed both claims arguing that the clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the 2nd century it was also known to the romans who named it landica noted researchers masters and johnson conducted extensive studies of the clitoris body modification the external part of the clitoris may be partially or totally removed during female genital cutting also known as a clitoridectomy or female genital mutilation fgm in voluntary or involuntary procedures the topic is highly controversial with many countries condemning the traditions that give rise to involuntary procedures and with some countries outlawing even voluntary procedures amnesty international estimates that over 2 million involuntary female circumcisions are being performed every year mainly in african countries in various cultures the clitoris is sometimes pierced directly in u s body modification culture it s actually extremely rare for the clitoral shaft itself to be pierced as of the already few females who desire the piercing only a small percentage are anatomically suited for it furthermore most piercing artists are understandably reluctant to attempt such a delicate procedure some styles such as the isabella the nefertiti and the triangle do pass through the clitoris but are placed deep at the base where they provide unique stimulation they still require the proper genital build but are more common than shaft piercings additionally what is erroneously referred to as a clit piercing is almost always the much more common and much less complicated clitoral hood piercing some cultures at various times in history have practiced stretching which can enlarge the clitoris or can make it more visible enlargement may be intentional or unintentional those taking hormones and or other medications as part of female to male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth individual desires and the difficulties of surgical phalloplasty often result in the retention of the female genitalia the enlarged clitoris analogous to a penis as part of the newly male body on the other hand use of anabolic steroids by female bodybuilders and other athletes can result in significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on the female body temporary engorgement results from suction pumping practiced to enhance sexual pleasure or for aesthetic purposes additional

 id=175547 title red storm rising nonfiltered 767 processed 759 dbindex 450775 red storm rising is a 1986 techno thriller novel by tom clancy and larry bond about a third world war in europe between nato and warsaw pact forces set around the mid 1980s probably in 1986 or 1987 though there are other novels dealing with a fictional world war iii this one is notable for the way in which numerous settings for the action from atlantic convoy duty to shooting down reconnaissance satellites to tank battles in germany all have an integral part to play on the outcome this is one of two novels that has no association with clancy s others as it does not fall in the ryanverse the novel eventually lent its name to a game development company called red storm entertainment which clancy co founded in 1997 plot summary azerbaijani terrorists destroy a new oil production facility at nizhnevartovsk ussr severely crippling soviet oil production and threatening to wreck the soviet economy facing a perceived need to make crippling concessions to the west to survive the crisis the politburo chooses a different path war the politburo decides to seize the persian gulf oil fields by force according to the carter doctrine any attack on the persian gulf is an attack on a vital strategic interest of the united states and will be treated as such meaning a military response to prevent nato s combined reaction they first launch a kgb operation to split nato by making it appear as if west germany launched an unprovoked terrorist attack on the soviet union followed by an invasion of europe in response to that attack with west germany occupied and nato defeated it is expected well hoped that the united states will not feel the need to rescue the arab oil states as it can meet its oil needs with western hemisphere sources the kgb operation has limited success the coming soviet attack on germany is detected only a few days in advance when a spetsnaz major is captured in aachen the officer s capture gives nato time to start mobilization and providing sufficient evidence to prevent the complete fracturing of the alliance nonetheless it scores some success as several countries notably greece and japan are convinced that this is a german russian disagreement that they refuse to be involved in thus the soviets have a quiet pacific theater and remove the southern front in the coming conflict in western europe as turkey is unable or unwilling to launch an offensive alone nato aircraft manage to reduce soviet ground superiority early in the war by using first generation stealth planes and tactical fighter bombers to eliminate five soviet mainstay awacs aircraft several bridges bridge equipment and crews and soviet tactical fighters but this advantage is short lived germany becomes the epicenter of the conflict here nato forces slowly give ground while inflicting terrible losses on the red army one of the strategic masterstrokes of the soviet union s opening moves in the war is its seizure of iceland capturing the nato air station at keflavík this disrupts the g i u k sosus line american seabed hydrophones expected to prevent the soviet navy from operating effectively in the atlantic by making it impossible for their ships and submarines to enter the atlantic undetected in addition the soviet navy isolate and protect their ssbn fleet freeing their ssn force the soviet navy is able to act as an offensive weapon and the warsaw pact seriously damages nato s war effort by interdicting resupply convoys coming from north america with both aircraft and submarines this advantage is put to immediate use as a nato carrier battle group led by uss nimitz uss saratoga and the french carrier foch is successfully attacked by soviet backfire bombers foch is sunk the transport saipan explodes taking 2 500 marines with her and the two american carriers are forced to spend several weeks in drydock at southampton england in west germany the battle becomes a war of attrition that the soviets expect to win having greater reserves of men and matériel nato holds the warsaw pact forces to small but continual advances but only through the profligate expenditure of every weapon at hand and as the soviet success in destroying the atlantic convoys continues things start to look grim for the nato forces with the death of the soviet political favorite cinc west by a nato air attack on the russian rear lines the more competent cinc southwest and his second in command general colonel pavel leonidovich alekseyev take over on the german front alekseyev commands a successful soviet attack on the town of alfeld finally giving the red army the breakthrough it needs as the omg operational maneuver group forces start to deploy nato looks to lose hold on all of germany east of the weser when a brilliantly timed naval attack on russian bomber bases with submarine launched cruise missiles cripples the soviet bomber force the soviets lose their most effective convoy killing weapon simultaneously the red army proves unable to capitalize on its breakthrough which leads the politburo to consider the use of tactical nuclear weapons at the front to regain the initiative a captured soviet pilot from the iceland campaign also under heavy medication reveals to the nato forces why the war was started oil the nato forces immediatly reevaluate their bombing tactics over the front and start blowing up every fuel depot they can find which had been widely spaced and smaller than usual this cripples the soviet tanks keeping them from launching at least one major attack which would have caught the nato forces shorthanded and allowed reinforcements to arrive prior to the battle eventually general alekseyev recognizes this suicidal madness for what it is and joins forces with the head of the kgb and the petroleum minister mikhail eduardovich sergetov in staging a coup d état replacing the politburo with a troika consisting of sergetov agriculture minister f m krylov and longtime politburo member pyotr bromkovskiy a cease fire is sought by the soviets and accepted by an exhausted nato and the aftermath of the war is left unwritten characters in

during the war major amelia buns nakamura usaf a female f 15c pilot who becomes the first american female ace pilot by shooting down three tu 16 badger bombers and using asm 135 antisatellite missiles to destroy two soviet ocean reconnaissance satellites major themes this techno thriller is an examination of a conventional ground war between nato and the warsaw pact clancy suggests that several conventional ideas about a ground conflict between modern armies are wrong for example he proposes that munitions expenditures would be far higher than projected that combat helicopters like the ah 64 apache and the mi 24 hind are not nearly as survivable as projected that the mobility granted by modern armor means that the soviet doctrine of a massed thrust achieving a breakthrough of the enemy lines is ill founded the enemy can withdraw and reform its lines too easily for his forces to break and modern air power can only dominate a battlefield in the absence of an opposing modern air force clancy also incorporated the rumored f 19 stealth fighter into his plot the existence of stealth aircraft was an open secret among aerospace watchers in the 1980s but was highly classified at the time the novel was written in actuality computers of the day were not powerful enough to design the f 19 s curved surfaces resulting instead in the simpler and more angular f 117 nighthawk the 2003 invasion of iraq although far more of a mismatch than a late 1980s nato warsaw pact conflict would have been did provide some evidence for clancy s hypotheses the us army s apaches proved more vulnerable to ground fire than had been predicted and by the war s end the majority of close air support was being delivered by the more heavily armored a 10 thunderbolt ii ground attack aircraft fittingly clancy identifies the a 10 as being a key weapon in his red storm rising scenario his predictions on the high rate of munitions expenditure also appears to have been borne out even though the initial attack on iraq was short it drained u s arsenals to an alarming extent forcing the pentagon to undertake a crash program to rebuild stocks of smart bombs evidence for the prediction of high expenditures of munitions was already available from the 1973 yom kippur war in this conflict both sides consumed munitions so rapidly that within one week of the start of combat both the united states and the soviet union had to airlift munitions to their respective client states israel for the u s egypt and syria for the soviet union to avoid a collapse of their respective armed forces another point of interest is the use of america s iowa class battleships which in the novel are sent to iceland to support the united states marines during their amphibious landing the effective use of battleships in modern war was demonstrated during the 1991 gulf war when the missouri and wisconsin shelled shore based artillery sites antiship missile facilities and iraqi troop concentrations arrayed along the coasts of iraq and kuwait and on faylaka island military studies red storm rising is basic literature at many military academies inside and outside the united states as are several other books by tom clancy it is also frequently referred to by military scientists and is widely considered to be one of the most realistic representations of an imagined east west war board game in 1989 tsr inc released a board game designed by douglas niles based on the book the game won the origins award for best modern day boardgame of 1989 and best graphic presentation of a boardgame of 1989 computer games there is also a computer game based on the book s scenario produced and released by microprose in the late 1980s the player has a nuclear submarine in his command it features adventure elements and a plot in addition to the simulation the skill level can be changed by changing some of the initial conditions of the scenario the game was released for the amiga released in 1990 atari st 1989 commodore 64 1988 and ibm pc circa 1989 home computers the game centers around the effects that submarine warfare would have on the world war iii concept presented in the tom clancy book there were two styles of play single missions where one can select the general type of engagement they would fight and the campaign where a strategic map and issued missions added another layer of depth to the game unlike other games at the time like the world war ii simulation silent service or ea s 688 attack sub red storm rising rsr was not as graphically based the game centered around a screen that showed the plots of the ships using the abstract symbols used by the usn from this screen you could set a course target your weapons and see incoming fire the enemy was not always clear however as your passive sonar had to build up a contact rating if this was below 90 your contact would be possible and there would be a chance that the distance would be off at higher levels sometimes by a very significant amount other screens included a acoustical signature screen where the contact return would show on the analyzer and one could match it to known signatures a correct guess would boost the contact rating by 10 and put an id tag on the ship icon the oceanic or sea conditions screen showed the current model of the acoustical conditions of the game area it provided a depth view with concepts like the thermal layer to allow the player to hide by placing the submarine in a more advantageous acoustical position the game was very popular but did not spawn a series of games like silent service or 688 mainly because the simple graphics were not as worthwhile to update as games moved into 3d still many consider it to be the most realistic portrayal of nuclear submarine combat almost entirely dispensing with the notion of periscope runs in the face of modern sonar in 2005 a group of enthusiasts released a modification for close combat 5 called red storm rising thus producing a real time strategy game that is loosely based on the novel it was the first and only close combat 5 modification that is set in modern age all graphics and maps were made specifically for this mod and the result is rather professional it is available for free download to owners of close combat videogame the plot for red storm rising also inspired the choice of theatre and gameplay in digital image design s ef2000 in march of 2006 the germany 1985 mod for the military simulation game armed assault was founded by a group of well known mod makers from the famous arma s predecessor operation flashpoint this mod will cover all aspects of cold war era warfare in germany as described in red storm rising the concept for the germany 1985 mod was inspired by red storm rising the setting of germany in 1985 was chosen because of the diversity of equipment and vehicles available the relative parity of the nato and warsaw pact forces and the exciting and well known back story

 id=493820 title languages of the european union nonfiltered 773 processed 765 dbindex 450781 the languages of the european union are languages used by people within the member states of the european union they include the 23 official languages of the european union along with a range of others the eu asserts on its europa homepage languages europe s asset and has a special european commissioner for multilingualism leonard orban in the european union language policy is the responsibility of member states and eu does not have a common language policy european union institutions play a supporting role in this field based on the principle of subsidiarity their role is to promote cooperation between the member states and to promote the european dimension in the member states language policies eu encourages all its citizens to be multilingual specifically it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue though the eu has very limited influence in this area as the content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states a number of eu funding programmes actively promote language learning and linguistic diversity official languages of the european union the official languages of the european union as stipulated in the amended eec council regulation no 1 determining the languages to be used by the european economic community of 1958 04 15 are the number of member states exceeds the number of official languages as several national languages are shared by two or more countries namely dutch is official in the netherlands and belgium french in france belgium and luxembourg german in germany austria belgium and luxembourg and greek in greece and cyprus english and swedish are also shared the former by the united kingdom and the republic of ireland and the latter by sweden and finland but the fact that they are co official in ireland and finland with irish and finnish respectively means that the overall ratio of member states to national languages is unaffected furthermore not all national languages have been accorded the status of official eu languages these include luxembourgish an official language of luxembourg since 1984 and turkish an official language of cyprus all languages of the eu are also working languages documents which a member state or a person subject to the jurisdiction of a member state sends to institutions of the community may be drafted in any one of the official languages selected by the sender the reply shall be drafted in the same language regulations and other documents of general application shall be drafted in the twenty three official languages the official journal of the european union shall be published in the twenty three official languages legislation and documents of major public importance or interest are produced in all 23 official languages but that accounts for a minority of the institutions work other documents e g communications with the national authorities decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities and correspondence are translated only into the languages needed for internal purposes the eu institutions are allowed by law to choose their own language arrangements the european commission for example conducts its internal business in three languages english french and german and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes the european parliament on the other hand has members who need working documents in their own languages so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset according to the eu s english language website the cost of maintaining the instutions policy of multilingualism i e the cost of translation and interpretation is 1123 million which is 1 of the annual general budget of the eu or 2 28 per person per year status of lesser used languages there has been a suggestion in an official briefing that the implicit principle for official languages of the european union is that each member state can put forward at most one official language one member state one language this has not been confirmed in documents the spanish and irish governments have sought the status of official eu languages for basque catalan galician and irish the 2667th council meeting of the council of the european union in luxembourg on 13 june 2005 decided to authorise limited use at eu level of languages recognised by member states other than the official working languages besides making irish the 21st official language the council also granted recognition to languages other than the languages referred to in council regulation no 1 1958 whose status is recognised by the constitution of a member state on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law the official use of such languages will be authorised on the basis of an administrative arrangement concluded between the council and the requesting member state luxembourgish an official language of luxembourg and turkish an official language of cyprus have not used yet this provision irish although the irish language has been one of the official languages of the european union only since january 1 2007 it is the republic of ireland s first official language and has minority language status in northern ireland since the republic of ireland s accession to the european economic community now the european union in 1973 eu treaties have been published and authenticated in irish as an official treaty language as well as the eu official languages and one has been able to make written submissions to union institutions in irish on 13 june 2005 following a unanimous decision by eu foreign ministers it was announced that irish would be made the 21st official language of the eu but a derogation stipulates that not all documents have to be translated into irish as is the case with the other official languages the decision means that legislation approved by both the european parliament and the council of ministers will now be translated into irish and interpretation from irish will be available at european parliament plenary sessions and some council meetings the new arrangements came into effect on 1 january 2007 the cost of translation interpretation publication and legal services involved in making irish an official eu language is estimated at just under 3 5 million a year the derogation will be reviewed in four years and every five years thereafter irish is the only official language of the union that is not the most widely spoken language in any member state 2002 census figures show that in the republic of ireland there are 1 570 894 speakers of irish out of a population of 4 351 292 though only 350 000 use irish every day the majority of whom are schoolchildren it is also estimated that 165 000 people in northern ireland can speak irish there are small but slowly growing diaspora communities that speak irish around the world the largest being in the united states with 25 000 irish speakers catalan galician and basque although catalan galician and basque are not nation wide official languages in spain as co official languages in the respective regions they are eligible to benefit from official use in eu institutions under the terms of the 13 june 2005 resolution of the council of the european union the spanish government has assented to the provisions in respect of these languages the status of catalan spoken by many millions of citizens has been the subject of particular debate on 11 december 1990 the use of catalan was the subject of a european parliament resolution resolution a3 169 90 on languages in the european community and the situation of catalan oj c19 28 january 1991 on november 16 2005 the committee of the regions president peter straub signed an agreement with the spanish ambassador to the eu carlos sagües bastarreche approving the use of spanish regional languages in an eu institution for the first time in a meeting on that day with interpretation provided by european commission interpreters on july 3 2006 the european parliament s bureau approved a proposal by the spanish state to allow citizens to address the european parliament in basque catalan and galician two months after its initial rejection on november 30 2006 the european ombudsman nikiforos diamandouros and the spanish ambassador in the eu carlos bastarreche signed an agreement in brussels to allow spanish citizens to address complains to the european ombudsman in basque catalan valencian and galician all three co official languages in spain according to the agreement a translation body which will be set up and financed by the spanish government will be responsible for translating complaints submitted in these languages in turn it will translate the ombudsman s decisions from spanish castilian into the language of the complainant until such a body is established the agreement will not become effective welsh and scottish gaelic in response to a written parliamentary question tabled following the 2005 06 13 resolution on official use of regional languages the uk minister for europe douglas alexander stated on 2005 06 29 that the government have no current plans to make similar provisions for uk languages provision in the proposed constitutional treaty the treaty establishing a constitution for europe was drafted in the 21 official treaty languages of the eu the official languages plus irish in the languages of three candidate countries romanian bulgarian and turkish the former two have now joined the union it contains the following provision article iv 448 2 this treaty may also be translated into any other languages as determined by member states among those which in accordance with their constitutional order enjoy official status in all or part of their territory a certified copy of such translations shall be provided by the member states concerned to be deposited in the archives of the council note that the constitution has been signed by all member states and is in the ratification process following its rejection in referenda in france and the netherlands as matters stand it will not come into force migrant languages migrant languages are not given formal status or recognition in the eu or in the eu countries and they are not covered by eu language teaching programmes only national and local authorities may provide classes to help immigrants learn the language of their adopted country national sign languages in the european union roughly one person in one thousand uses a national sign language as a first language however there are many more that use one as their second language an increasing number of countries have some form of recognition of their national sign language such as belgium with flemish sign language vgt and belgian french sign language lsfb the united kingdom with british sign language bsl in northern ireland irish sign language isl and northern ireland sign language nisl are recognised as official languages on 1988 06 17 the european parliament unanimously approved a resolution about national sign languages this resolution asks all member states for recognition of their national sign languages as official languages which would bring better linguistic rights and protection for sign language users especially the deaf users of sign language language skills of european union citizens the following tables are based on special eurobarometer 243 of the european commission with the title europeans and their languages summary full text published on february 2006 with research carried out on november and december 2005 the survey was published before the 2007 enlargement of the european union when bulgaria and romania acceded this is a poll not a census 28 694 citizens with a minimum age of 15 were asked in the then 25 member states as well as in the then future member states bulgaria romania and the candidate countries croatia turkey at the time of the survey only citizens not immigrants were asked the first table shows what proportion of citizens said that they could have a conversation in each language as their mother tongue and as a second language or foreign language only the languages with at least 2 of the speakers are listed german is then the most widely spoken mother tongue with 17 of the speakers while english is the most widely spoken language in the eu with 50 one should also note that 100 of the hungarians 100 of the portuguese and 99 of the greeks speak the state language as their mother tongue the knowledge of foreign languages varies considerably in the specific countries as the table below shows the three most spoken second or foreign languages in the eu are english german and french when no rate is noted the language is not one of the three most spoken second or foreign languages in this country source data for eu25 published before 2007 enlargement 56 of citizens in the eu member states are able to hold a conversation in one language apart from their mother tongue this is 9 points more than was perceived in 2001 among the 15 member states at the time 28 of the respondents state that they speak two foreign languages well enough to have a conversation still almost half of the respondents 44 admit not knowing any other language than their mother tongue approximately 1 in 5 europeans can be described as an active language learner i e someone who has recently improved his her language skills or intends to do so over the following 12 months english remains the most widely spoken foreign language throughout europe 38 of eu citizens state that they have sufficient skills in english to have a conversation apart from the citizens of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland the two english speaking countries 14 of europeans indicate that they know either french or german along with their mother tongue french is most commonly studied and used in southern europe especially in mediterranean countries in germany romania the uk and ireland while german is commonly studied and used in the benelux countries in scandinavia and in the newer eu member states in 19 out of 29 countries polled english is the most widely known language apart from the mother tongue this being particularly the case in sweden 89 malta an ex british colony 88 and the netherlands 87 while german and french is so in three countries moreover the citizens of the eu think they speak english at a better level than any other second or foreign language 77 of eu citizens believe that children should learn english and that it s considered the number one language to learn in all countries where the research conducted but the united kingdom the republic of ireland and luxembourg all in all english either as a mother tongue or as a second foreign language is spoken by 51 of eu citizens followed by german with 32 and french with 28 of those asked with the enlargement of the european union the balance between french and german is slowly changing clearly more citizens in the new member states master german 23 compared with 12 in the eu15 while their skills in french and spanish are scarce 3 and 1 respectively compared with 16 and 7 among the eu15 group a notable exception is romania where 24 of the population speaks french as a foreign language compared to 6 who speaks german as a foreign language also 4 of the population speaks italian as a foreign language while 3 of the population speaks spanish as a foreign language it is worth pointing out that language skills are unevenly distributed both over the geographical area of europe and over sociodemographic groups reasonably good language competences are perceived in relatively small member states with several state languages lesser used native languages or language exchange with neighbouring countries this is the case for example in luxembourg where 92 speak at least two languages those who live in southern european countries or countries where one of the major european languages is a state language appear to have moderate language skills only 5 of turkish 13 of irish and 16 italians master at least two languages apart from their mother tongue a multilingual european is likely to be young well educated or still studying born in a country other than the country of residence who uses foreign languages for professional reasons and is motivated to learn consequently it seems that a large part of european society is not enjoying the advantages of multilingualism free language lessons 26 flexible language courses that suit one s schedule 18 and opportunities to learn languages in a country where it is spoken natively 17 are considered to be the main incentives encouraging language learning group lessons with a teacher 20 language lessons at school 18 one to one lessons with a teacher and long or frequent visits to a country where the language is spoken are considered to be the most suitable ways to learn languages regional and minority languages besides the languages of the republic of ireland spain and the uk see above there are other regional or minority languages spoken within the eu that do not have official recognition at eu level some of them may have some official status within the member state and count many more speakers than some of the lesser used official languages these include in this list constructed languages or dialects of an official language of member states are not included russian though not an official language of the european union russian is widely spoken in some of the newer member states of the union that were formerly in the eastern bloc russian is the native language of about 1 3 million slavs residing in latvia estonia and lithuania as well as a sizable community in germany russian is also understood by many ethnic latvians estonians and lithuanians since it was a compulsory subject of many curricula in these countries during the soviet era although rarely a native language russian is widely understood by many in bulgaria poland the czech republic slovakia some in hungary romania and other countries it is the 8th most spoken language in the eu about 7 of all eu citizens speak or understand russian to some extent migrant languages a wide variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by immigrant communities in eu countries turkish is spoken as a first language by an estimated 2 of the population in belgium and the western part of germany and by 1 in the netherlands other widely used migrant languages include maghreb arabic mainly in france and belgium urdu bengali and hindi spoken by immigrants from the indian sub continent in the united kingdom while balkan languages are spoken in many parts of the eu by migrants and refugees who have left the region as a result of the recent wars and unrest there many immigrant communities in the eu have been in place for several generations now and their members are bilingual at ease both in the local language and in that of their community linguistic classification of the eu official languages the majority of the official languages of the european union belong to the indo european language family the three dominant subfamilies being the germanic romance and slavic languages germanic languages are widely spoken in central and northern areas of the eu and include danish dutch english german and swedish romance languages are spoken in western and southern regions and include french italian portuguese romanian and spanish the slavic languages are to be found in the eastern regions and include bulgarian czech polish slovak and slovene the baltic languages latvian and lithuanian the celtic language irish and greek are also of indo european origin outside the indo european family estonian finnish and hungarian are finno ugric languages while maltese is the only semitic language with official status in the eu all official eu languages except greek written with the greek alphabet and bulgarian written in the cyrillic alphabet are written with the latin alphabet eu initiatives for language learning and linguistic diversity beginning with the lingua programme in 1990 the european union invests more than 30 million a year out of a 120 billion eu budget promoting language learning through the socrates and leonardo da vinci programmes in bursaries to enable language teachers to be trained abroad placing foreign language assistants in schools funding class exchanges to motivate pupils to learn languages creating new language courses on cds and the internet and projects that raise awareness of the benefits of language learning through strategic studies the commission promotes debate innovation and the exchange of good practice in addition the mainstream actions of community programmes which encourage mobility and transnational partnerships motivate participants to learn languages youth exchanges town twinning projects and the european voluntary service also promote multilingualism since 1997 the culture 2000 programme has financed the translation of around 2 000 literary works from and into european languages the new programmes proposed for implementation for the financial perspective 2007 2013 culture 2007 youth in action and lifelong learning will continue and develop this kind of support in addition the eu provides the main financial support to the european bureau for lesser used languages a non governmental organisation which represents the interests of the over 40 million citizens who belong to a regional and minority language community and for the mercator networks of universities active in research on lesser used languages in europe following a request from the european parliament the commission in 2004 launched a feasibility study on the possible creation of a new eu agency european agency for language learning and linguistic diversity the study concludes that there are unmet needs in this field and proposes two options creating an agency or setting up a european network of language diversity centres the commission believes that a network would be the most appropriate next step and where possible should build on existing structures it will examine the possibility of financing it on a multi annual basis through the proposed lifelong learning programme although not an eu treaty some eu member states have ratified the european charter for regional or minority languages its ratification is also a prerequisite for new member states joining the union to encourage language learning the eu supported the council of europe initiatives for european year of languages 2001 and the annual celebration of european day of languages on september 26 to encourage the member states to cooperate and to disseminate best practice the commission has issued a communication on july 24 2003 on promoting language learning and linguistic diversity an action plan 2004 2006 summary and a communication on november 22 2005 on a new framework strategy for multilingualism summary from november 22 2004 the european commissioner for education and culture portfolio included an explicit reference to languages and became european commissioner for education

of his career on a pitch that quickly deteriorated and in styris own words was junk with former england wicket keeper john crawley starring in the first innings making a controlled 84 before being ninth out to alan richardson there were disappointments for england fans though who had hoped that kevin pietersen would find some form instead he was out for a 10 ball duck in the first innings hampshire made 275 in their first innings alan richardson and scott styris taking four wickets each middlesex reply would have been a sorry one but for a big partnership between owais shah 83 and irish left hander ed joyce 70 who continued his great form in the championship passing 400 runs in his third match of the season the pair were the only ones who passed 35 but their fourth wicket partnership of 166 was the highest in the match however leg spinner shane warne got the better of both of them in the end as joyce gave a return catch and shah was stumped off the bowling of the australian with hampshire losing two quick wickets to be 28 for 2 at the close the match hung in the balance with nightwatchman billy taylor on 0 and australian batsman simon katich on 1 billy taylor however played a special knock lasting 116 balls he scored only 9 runs but his stamina proved invaluable he forged good partnerships with katich and crawley giving hampshire a good platform to hit loose from wicketkeeper nic pothas was top scorer with 65 but zimbabwe all rounder sean ervine 30 and dimitri mascarenhas 44 also chipped in to lift hampshire to 304 a spirited reply from middlesex was always tampered by the hampshire bowlers chipping away at their line up patiently and despite 52 from former kent batsman ed smith middlesex were defeated as chris tremlett ripped out the tail

show kevin pietersen played a typical knock scoring 80 off 50 balls with six sixes while dimitri mascarenhas got himself a 26 ball fifty as hampshire amassed 353 for 8 off 45 overs a run rate of 7 84 despite owais shah s 89 middlesex were never in it and crumbled to 248 all out in just 39 overs pietersen bowling the last over conceding a single off the first ball before bowling four dot balls to

of the fast scoring making a century off 99 balls and ending with 126 hampshire eventually made 401 for 8 declared to get full batting points before attacking glamorgan chris tremlett bowled well in the attempt removing david hemp mike powell and jonathan hughes among others to take four for 42 and reduce glamorgan to 229 a score that would have been much lower but for darren thomas who blitzed his way to 63 following on glamorgan batted more casually getting to 77 for 1 at stumps on day 3 but wickets tumbled in the morning reducing glamorgan to 147 for 5 robert croft and mike powell rebuilt but when australian batsman simon katich had croft caught by skipper shane warne and powell went a few overs later glamorgan imploded to 250 all out as zimbabwe all rounder sean ervine picked up the last three wickets finishing with five for 60 while tremlett took three for 48 in reply hampshire brushed aside the target of 79 inside fifteen overs with katich unusually opening the batting with

streak who took four wickets for 11 from nine overs including five maidens reduced hampshire to 34 for 5 before michael brown and sean ervine rebuilt however two quick wickets before tea meant that hampshire led by six runs with three wickets remaining a surefire loss almost they rebuilt somewhat but another two wickets from streak resulted in him finishing with 6 for 31 and hampshire were

hampshire hawks recorded a relatively comfortable seven wicket win at the rose bowl batting first glamorgan were in a good position at 117 for 1 but shaun udal and shane warne chipped away at the glamorgan middle order robert croft the former england spinner top scored with a healthy 88 and an eighth wicket partnership of 23 rescued glamorgan to 211 for 7 it was never enough however as all hampshire batsmen excluding derek kenway who was out for 4 fired and took runs at will off the bowling with 45 deliveries and seven wickets remaining hampshire eased to victory to increase the gap to the relegation zone cricinfo scorecard twenty20 cup group stage hampshire were without a win for the first two twenty20 games losing to middlesex in a close game before having a match with sussex rained off but they won a low scoring match against surrey lions at the oval they followed up with a win over kent and two no results with essex but a loss to sussex were to be crucial despite a win over middlesex on the last matchday they were still behind middlesex on games won and behind sussex on head to head thus they finished fourth in the table and did not qualify for the quarter finals hampshire v middlesex 22 june middlesex 2pts beat hampshire 0pts by 18 runs owais shah made a good attempt at getting the highest strike rate of the opening day of twenty20 cricket recording 72 runs off only 30 balls to lift middlesex crusaders to an unassailable 210 for 6 for hampshire hawks shane warne showed somewhat poor captaincy when zimbabwean all rounder sean ervine was the eighth man to come on to bowl and then took two for 13 from two overs new zealander craig mcmillan meanwhile conceded twenty eight runs from his only over despite nic pothas scoring 59 off 39 balls the hawks were nowhere near keeping up with the required pace and middlesex bowler irfan pathan was a main cause of that he took three for 16 from four overs as hampshire finished on 192 for 7 cricinfo scorecard

reduced surrey lions to pieces at the oval only rikki clarke passed 12 runs for surrey and he did so in style making 52 with six fours and a six while logan and bruce shared seven wickets btetween them hampshire had reason to be happy with bowling surrey out for 118 although they did concede 17 wides as extras were the second highest scorer for surrey hampshire then attempted to collapse of

for 28 which helped peg kent spitfires back to 154 for 9 hampshire s reply was very well timed and even a good bowling spell from kent s james tredwell who only conceded sixteen runs off the bat in four overs could not stop the hawks lawrence prittipaul made 35 before being out on the penultimate ball with the scores tied but off spinner and stand in captain shaun udal however made a single on

slowed the sharks progression as they slumped to 88 for 5 but michael yardy hit 10 in four balls in an unbeaten 11 run sixth wicket stand with carl hopkinson chasing hampshire never quite kept up with

fifth in eight innings while scott styris and paul weekes made quick scores to up the run rate shaun udal sean ervine and craig mcmillan all got two wickets hampshire hawks started slowly at about seven an over but mcmillan took a liking to chris peploe in particular as he smashed five sixes in his half hour 65 not out and thanks to mcmillan s big hitting hampshire won with sixteen balls and six wickets to spare however it was in vain with only three wins they finished fourth in the south division tables while middlesex qualified despite having a poorer net run rate than hampshire cricinfo scorecard july middlesex however beat hampshire rather comfortably in the county championship the following week to send hampshire nearer the relegation mire and after the loss to nottinghamshire in the national league it became woefully clear that hampshire s lack of pietersen and warne hurt them however they succeeded in digging out a 35 run win over sussex who only needed 104 for seven wickets on the fourth day but were bowled out by dimitri mascarenhas and sean ervine two rained off matches followed against bangladesh a and worcestershire royals county championship middlesex v hampshire 8 11 july middlesex 19pts beat hampshire 7pts by two wickets hampshire won the toss and chose to bat at a southgate wicket which the final scores suggested to be not as batting friendly as a month ago when 13 wickets fell in the championship match between middlesex and glamorgan three wickets from chris peploe set the visitors back to 189 for 7 but a 79 ball century from shane warne just in time to get some ashes form lifted them to 355 the returning irishman ed joyce made 54 for middlesex and jamie dalrymple made 62 but despite those innings and 37 extras middlesex could only scamper 272 hampshire were leading by 104 overnight with one wicket down but the third day belonged to dalrymple the kenyan born off spinner took four for 53 including internationals john crawley and craig mcmillan as hampshire imploded to 192 a twenty20 style hit out from owais shah who made 60 off 56 balls lifted middlesex to 168 for 4 at stumps and as the hampshire captain warne chose to bowl himself over after over despite being smashed out of the park ending with 108 runs off nearly 30 overs for only two wickets middlesex reached the target shortly before lunch on day four

358 for 6 in 50 overs james benning with 73 and graham thorpe with 60 also contributed as hampshire used seven bowlers who all failed to keep their conceded runs below six an over in reply azhar mahmood served up a wicket maiden over in the first over of hampshire s innings leaving hampshire 359 to win with nine wickets in hand but shane watson and craig mcmillan put the visitors from the south back on track with a partnership of 81 for the fourth wicket when mcmillan was run out hampshire were 200 for 4 but watson powered on to make 132 his highest career list a cricket score to boost hampshire to 342 for 8 when tim murtagh broke through his defences by then it was too late as shaun udal completed his 44 not out having added 63 with watson for the eighth wicket earlier and

17 july nottinghamshire 4pts beat hampshire 0pts by one wicket captain stephen fleming stood tall for nottinghamshire outlaws winning them the game as they chased down 241 at trent bridge hampshire hawks had batted first and no hawk batsman converted their starts and gareth clough s two for 44 threatened to stop their innings prematurely as they were 152 for 6 when kevin latouf gave a return catch to samit patel however a big seventh wicket partnership between dimitri mascarenhas and sean ervine lifted hampshire to 240 for 8 mascarenhas and ervine also grabbed two wickets each in the nottinghamshire reply and things looked grim for the hosts when chris read departed for 4 with nottinghamshire still needing 114 runs for the last four wickets however fleming and mark ealham put the chase back on with a partnership of 75 before hampshire struck again with wickets in successive overs and then shaun udal had greg smith lbw for 6 needing 15 for the last wicket fleming shielded andrew harris from strike harris faced three balls in a partnership of 19 to end with 102 not out his sixteenth one day century to win the match for nottinghamshire with an over to spare notable also

wicketkeeper nic pothas made his way to a four hour 135 his twelfth first class century after jason lewry james kirtley and rana naved ul hasan had reduced hampshire to 102 for 6 in the middle of the afternoon session on the first day pothas was well supported by zimbabwean sean ervine who made 69 and the pair added 191 in three hours before naved ul hasan broke through with the last ball of the day having ervine caught by ian ward hampshire slumped to 309 on the morning of day two and solid contributions from the entire batting order bar number three michael yardy who made a duck lifted sussex to a slender seven run lead amid ervine s swing bowling which yielded five wickets for 73 however mushtaq ahmed got the early breakthrough for sussex and james kirtley ripped out two quick wickets as hampshire folded to 22 for 3 overnight kirtley and naved ul hasan continued to pile on the pressure on the third morning as they eked out two catches and reduced hampshire to 28 for 5 a lead of 21 however once again the all rounders fought back australian shane watson made 82 while pothas added 74 and number 11 chris tremlett made an unbeaten 44 to ensure that hampshire set a competitive target of 271 despite kirtley s five for 67 ian ward made 60 and murray goodwin an unbeaten 51 as sussex cruised to 167 for 3 after only 38 overs on day three needing 104 more to win on the fourth day goodwin added 20 more on the final morning before dimitri mascarenhas snared him out but he had stood tall in mascarenhas early spell on the morning of day 4 which had yielded three wickets for two runs goodwin was eventually caught by greg lamb but sussex still needed only 55 for the last three wickets however sean ervine added the wickets of pakistanis rana and ahmed to his tally to help bowl sussex out for 235 thus hampshire took the victory in a closely contested game although they were later deducted half a point for a slow over rate cricinfo scorecard tour match

by 178 runs gloucestershire bowlers steve kirby jon lewis and malinga bandara threatened to make a mockery of shaun udal s decision to have a bat at bristol as hampshire fell to 81 for 7 with five batsmen out for single figures however a 257 run partnership a hampshire record for the eighth wicket between nic pothas and andy bichel turned the match around as lewis was carted for 112 runs in his 20 overs despite five of them being maiden overs hampshire finished their innings on 385 all out after pothas had made 139 and bichel 138 and gloucestershire struggled initially with the bat losing their first two wickets for 25 runs admittedly with kirby filling the role of nightwatchman on the second day alex gidman posted 115 and steve adshead 73 to lift gloucestershire from 191 for 6 to 363 hampshire then collapsed again falling to 23 for 3 including the wicket of nightwatchman chris tremlett before john crawley and shane watson rescued them with a 120 run partnership as spinners bandara and ian fisher toiled away to little effect hampshire eventually declared on 388 for 7 with four of their batsmen passing fifty which left gloucestershire 411 to win in a day that never looked likely but attritional cricket from ramnaresh sarwan and matt windows lifted gloucestershire to 156 for 2 and then gidman came in to add a further 39 for the fourth wicket however shane watson got a vital breakthrough with the wicket of gidman shaun udal unleashed a spell of furious off spin on the tail taking six for 61 and gloucestershire were bowled out with an hour to spare cricinfo scorecard

despite nic pothas sean ervine and shane watson all making at least 40 in reply william weston and matt windows paired up for 106 runs for the second wicket and not even chris tremlett who took three

symonds put on a 94 run partnership to help lancashire to 155 for 2 however australian all rounder andy bichel took three for 34 dimitri mascarenhas rounded off his nine overs by taking two wickets

reply as hampshire eased to 82 for 1 before play was stopped due to bad weather on day three however kent hit back in 33 fiery overs before lunch amjad khan and min patel both took two wickets and despite more runs from ervine who finished with 74 hampshire crumbled to 182 for 7 at lunch however andy bichel and nic pothas added 138 for the eighth wicket as hampshire eked out 325 with bichel top scoring from number nine with 87 off 90 balls kent got a good start to their attempt to get quick runs and put a big target up for hampshire as they moved to 140 for 4 just before the close of play but shane watson took two quick wickets and shaun udal one and all of a sudden it was up to justin kemp and andrew hall to save kent as they were 153 for 7 overnight kemp fell on the fourth morning as kent rolled over for 185 setting up a potentially exciting finish with 307 runs to get in 83 overs a 95 run partnership between sean ervine and john crawley put hampshire into a good position at 139

and win the game for hampshire county championship surrey v hampshire 24 27 august hampshire 11pts drew with surrey 10pts the first day was rained off and in only three days of cricket neither team

first and after losing richard clinton and mark ramprakash early scott newman lashed out in a 65 ball cameo he hit fifteen fours in his 71 before finally being bowled by dimitri mascarenhas indeed the

shaun udal wrapping up the tail with the three last wickets falling in four balls mohammad akram then had both openers caught behind as hampshire closed on 28 for 2 but surrey toiled for little reward

while the rest of the top order deserted him making 88 but when three wickets fell for only three runs and the score was 172 for 7 hampshire would have fancied their chances of bowling essex out only two more wickets fell though as contributions from ryan ten doeschate graham napier and kaneria propelled essex to 222 for 9 at the end of their 45 overs hampshire and england fast bowler chris tremlett got napier ten doeschate and james middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48 despite john crawley and nic pothas recording a first wicket partnership of 95 kaneria kept his calm only allowing 26 runs off his nine overs and boundaries were rare after pothas and crawley were dismissed in the end hampshire finished on 210 for 8 13 runs short of victory they could put some of the blame on their overseas players as australians shane watson and andy bichel contributed only four runs off 18 deliveries cricinfo scorecard september a three day win over warwickshire saw them enjoy one day at the top of the championship before they were overtaken by nottinghamshire on 3 september however they won the c g trophy with an 18 run win over warwickshire meaning that they were the only

with a 151 run defeat to glamorgan however they recovered to beat glamorgan in the championship and ended the championship season with a thumping innings and 188 run victory over the county champions nottinghamshire to finish second 2 5 points behind hampshire then lost their final game of the season to just nottinghamshire which led to their relegation into division two of the national league

for 60 the score had moved to 279 for 3 jonathan trott and makhaya ntini shared three wickets before the end of the day leaving hampshire 353 for 6 overnight but shane watson and dimitri mascarenhas shared a mammoth 234 run partnership for the seventh wicket watson hit a career best 203 not out while mascarenhas took three hours for an unbeaten 102 the first century of his season before shaun udal declared warwickshire stumbled early on falling to 21 for 2 but an unbeaten 97 from nick knight lifted them to 145 for 4 at the close of play on day two knight could not save warwickshire alone though and warwickshire lost sixteen wickets on the third day to crumble to an innings defeat knight got his century ending with 116 but no other batsman passed 30 as they were all out for 258 in the first innings they were asked to follow on 318 behind and did rather well initially getting the score to 110 for 1 after two hours then jonathan trott and ian westwood fell in quick succession leaving jamie troughton to try and tie together a match saving innings with the lower order he made a two hour 76 before being ninth out caught off shaun udal s bowling ending warwickshire s resistance no further runs were added for the tenth wicket as makhaya ntini was bowled by udal and warwickshire ended on 232 all out 86 runs short of making hampshire bat again hampshire captain udal finished with

in a high scoring final at lord s leaving only the county championship left for grabs nic pothas and sean ervine added 136 runs for the second wicket to propel hampshire to a big total against warwickshire whose bowlers gave away 20 runs from wides but still managed to bowl hampshire out on the last ball ervine was fifth out taking 91 balls for his second successive c g century before he was caught off jonathan trott who finished with three wickets for 35 runs neil carter took five wickets to redeem his 66 conceded runs while makhaya ntini bowled two maiden overs for warwickshire but went wicketless warwickshire were set to chase 291 to win and carter fulfilled his job as a pinch hitter well scoring four fours and one six en route to 32 and nick knight and ian bell kept up with the required run rate well however bell suffered cramps just before he reached 50 and that limited his movements he succumbed shortly afterwards chipping a simple catch to chris tremlett and was gone for 54 the other batsmen tried to add runs with knight but yielded to the hampshire bowling and fielding effort and when knight was finally dismissed for 118 warwickshire needed 40 runs for the last three wickets shane watson effectively stopped that having dougie brown and ashley giles out bowled leaving warwickshire to hit about 20 runs in the last over it was too much for makhaya ntini who was bowled by chris tremlett with the second ball of the last over and thus hampshire took an 18 run victory cricinfo scorecard national league hampshire v middlesex 5 september middlesex 4pts beat

set 320 to win glamorgan went about it positively as croft led from the front with a well paced 90 once he was caught behind off sean ervine however glamorgan needed 94 for the last three wickets and

conquer the city failed due to the insufficient preparation by the spanish army which had not expected much resistance this initial victory gave the defenders morale a big boost in the middle ages it was not usual to fight in the winter but the city of haarlem was crucial and don fadrique stayed and put the town under siege the first two months of the siege the situation was in balance the spanish

 id=3309501 title history of the northern territory nonfiltered 807 processed 799 dbindex 450816 the history of the northern territory began over 40 000 years ago when indigenous australians settled the region makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the northern territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards and possibly for 300 years prior to that while the coast of the territory was first seen by europeans in the 17th century the british were the first to attempt to settle the coastal regions of the territory in the 19th century however no attempt was successful until the establishment of a settlement at port darwin in 1869 prehistory although sparse the archeological record of the northern territory provides evidence of settlement around 40 000 years ago at malakunanja and nauwalabila although there is controversy surrounding the thermoluminescent dating of these sites during this period sea levels were 100 150m lower than at present and australia and new guinea along with large tracts of what is now the timor sea formed one single landmass abundant and complex rock art testifies to the rich cultural and spiritual lives of the original inhabitants of the northern territory and in many areas of the northern territory there is a cultural continuum between the earliest inhabitants and the indigenous population today rock art is extremely difficult to date with any reliability and it can also be difficult to identify a linear sequence of art due to the reworking and reinterpretation of older art by younger generations however archeologists have been able to identify three distinct phases of art pre estaurine dry climate and extinct animals estaurine rising sea levels and marine fauna and freshwater freshwater fauna moving into historical subjects such as makassan traders and european technology eg guns rock art also demonstrates cultural and technological changes for instance boomerangs give way to broad spearthrowers which give way to long spearthrowers which give way to guns and boats the dingo was introduced from asia around 5000 years ago and quickly became integrated into aboriginal societies where they played a role in hunting and provided warmth on cold nights makassan trade traders from makassar now ujung pandang began journeying to the north of australia in search of trepang which was prized for its culinary and medicinal values in chinese markets the voyages dated from at least 1720 although there are reports of visits perhaps 300 years prior to that and extended from the kimberleys in the west to the east of gulf of carpentaria the makassans had extensive contact with the indigenous tribes of the northern territory trading cloth knives alcohol and tobacco for the right to fish in territory waters and use aboriginal labour european coastal exploration the first recorded sighting of the northern territory coastline was by dutch navigator willem janszoon aboard the ship duyfken in 1623 abel tasman and numerous french navigators also charted the coast naming many prominent features british admiral philip parker king also made surveys of the coast european exploration and settlement following the european settlement of australian in 1788 four unsuccessful attempts were made to settle coastal areas of the northern territory prior to the establishment of darwin on september 30 1824 british captain james gordon bremer established fort dundas on melville island as a part of the colony of new south wales fort dundas was the first settlement in northern australia however poor relations with the tiwi cyclones and other difficulties of tropical living led to the fort being abandoned in 1828 a second settlement was established on the cobourg peninsula at raffles bay on june 18 1827 fort wellington was founded by captain james stirling however it was also abandoned in 1829 the british made a third attempt in 1838 establishing fort victoria at port essington october 27 1838 bremer was in command of the new settlement in july 1839 the hms beagle and her crew visited the settlement bremer left the settlement in 1839 and following his departure conditions in the settlement deteriorated explorer ludwig leichhardt travelled from moreton bay overland to port essington an unsuccessful migration scheme was tried and the first catholic priest father angelo confalonieri in the area arrived in 1846 however the settlement disbanded on december 1 1849 in 1863 the northern territory was annexed by south australia by letters patent following annexation of the territory by south australia a fourth attempt at settlement occurred in 1864 escape cliffs about 75 kilometres from present day darwin in 1864 colonel boyle travis finniss was responsible for the settlement there were numerous confrontations with the local marananggu aborigines and when he was recalled to adelaide in 1867 the settlement disbanded the south australian government also tried to find sites for additional settlements sending explorer john mckinlay to search in the region of the adelaide river however he had no success finally on february 5 1869 george goyder the surveyor general of south australia established a small settlement of 135 men and women at port darwin goyder named the settlement palmerston after the british prime minister lord palmerston in 1870 the first poles for the overland telegraph were erected in darwin connecting australia to the rest of the world the construction of the overland telegraph led to more exploration of the interior of the territory and the discovery of gold at pine creek in the 1880s further boosted the young colony s development twentieth century on 1 january 1911 a decade after federation the

crimson and black field its mascots are the polar bear and the pf bigram the present house master and co master are jim and sue mccarthy they have served in this capacity since 1996 history early years radcliffe college students first took up residence on campus in 1901 and the oldest parts of pfoho date to that year moors opened in time for the 1949 1950 academic year the year plans for holmes were first drawn up construction of comstock began in 1957 the jordans two separate buildings located at the corner of walker and shepard streets began as an experiment in cooperative living in 1961 they gradually became used as overflow housing in 1985 although one building persisted as a co op until at least until 1997 wolbach formerly an apartment building was purchased by harvard by 1964 the townhouses of faculty row joined the house in 1971 north house the name north house first appeared in 1961 and consisted of comstock moors and holmes wolbach did not yet belong to harvard at this point the jordans were initially assigned to the no longer existent east house male students were first assigned to north house around 1971 house master and co master woody and hanna hastings began their term in 1975 major renovations of 1986 1988 they attempted to cultivate house spirit by integrating and interconnecting the buildings woody hastings remarked any student in north house ought to be able to get from any place in the house to any other place in the house in his pjs or less accordingly when plans were drawn up for a major renovation in the mid 1980s the hastings rejected an early proposal that would have segmented the house into disconnected vertical entryways opting instead for a plan that connected the bricks to one another more closely and in the process allowed the construction of the holmes junior common room the pfoho grille the comstock library and the centralized balconied dining hall the duplex suites on the top floors of the bricks were also created during this renovation a breezeway connecting wolbach to moors long advocated by hastings was constructed in 2002 renamed as pforzheimer in 1995 north house was renamed pforzheimer house this caused consternation at first since the pforzheimers were known primarily as major university donors there was a widespread sense that naming rights to the building had been sold off a boston globe columnist referred to the pforzheimer house flap saying that harvard renamed the radcliffe owned house after a loyal donor without consulting president linda wilson co the harvard noteables their spelling wrote five song parodies lamenting the name change however north house masters j woodley and hanna hastings said they were thrilled and hanna was quoted as saying it s just what we ve been asking for we wanted to be more than a direction the naming represented the first time that one of harvard s houses had been named for a jewish family or person pretty quickly students grew used to the new name the letters f or ph were replaced by pf in house related words hence pformal pfoho pfora and pfreshman welcome notable exceptions faculty row thursdayfest in 1996 the house welcomed new masters the mccarthys to go with its new name a central common room in moors was named for the hastings upon their retirement in 1996 the new york times noted that many black and hispanic students lived in the radcliffe quadrangle in the pforzheimer house while the boston globe observed that pforzheimer formerly north house evolved into a base for black student activism and a mecca for premeds and observed that the distinct cultures of the residence halls was about to be broken up by the then new policy of assigning students randomly to residence halls dispute with adams on dining access in october of 1999 adams house began enforcing a long standing policy of closing its dining hall to non residents during peak hours a policy particularly inconvenient to pforzheimer house residents who live farthest from the main class buildings at harvard yard a light hearted war erupted between the houses when residents of pforzheimer house stole the adams house gong which adams house rung to embarrass students from other houses attempting to sneak into their dinning hall pforzheimer house also banned adams house residents from the pfoho dinning hall a mostly symbolic gesture in response to the stolen gong and the dinning hall ban adams house declared that it was stealing the pforzheimer pf and would henceforth be known as pfadams house to settle this war adams and pforzheimer house agreed to a binding competition including a football game a tug of war and a dramatics contest an adams win would result in a return of the gong continued dinning hall ban and continued use of pfadams house with pfoho becoming orzheimer house a pfoho win would result in a return to adams from pfadams the return of the gong and grant pfoho residents perpetual dinning hall privileges at adams house pforzheimer house won and adams accordingly agreed to provide its residents with id stickers granting them access to the adams dining hall administration as with all houses at harvard college

various rounds of renovation pfoho residents are colloquially known as pfohosers the term actually existed as nohoser before the house acquired its current name combined with the fact that the house

 id=508100 title demon dungeons dragons nonfiltered 836 processed 828 dbindex 450845 in the dungeons dragons fantasy role playing game demons are the most widespread race of fiends the demons are chaotic evil by nature and are native to the abyss demons have no true rulers though powerful demon lords are able to gain enough power and influence to gain control over sizeable armies of demonic creatures types of demons in first edition advanced dungeons dragons some types of demons were not given species names but were rather referred to as type i through type vi demons in subsequent editions types i vi were instead known as vrocks hezrou glabrezu nalfeshnee mariliths and balors respectively some of these names were originally given in the first edition monster manual as example names of specific demons of that type so for instance marilith was the originally the name of an individual type v demon there are currently three known subtypes of demon obyrith the obyriths are so ancient that they predate mortal life and even the gods they rarely have a humanoid shape and some say that just looking at an obyrith can drive a mortal insane some obyrith lords have evolved over time to take on more recognizable shapes such as pazuzu or pale night other known obyrith demon lords include obox ob dagon the queen of chaos the malgoth ugudenk bechard vroth khun ubothar and cabiri imprisoned in the wells of darkness asima and numerous other obyrith lords whose names were lost to time have been destroyed tanar ri the tanar ri are a race of numerous demons originally created by the obyriths as slaves the tanar ri eventually revolted against the obyriths killing most of them and taking over as the dominant race of demons on the abyss most known demon lords are tanar ri with the exceptions being listed above the tanar ri are essentially classic demons those that arose as a result of faith and humanity they re reflections of cruelty and evil and sin and usually have a basic humanoid shape although there are several exceptions there are many known types of tanar ri including alkilith alu fiend anzu armanite arrow demon babau balor bar lgura bulezau cambion cerebrilith chasme dretch glabrezu goristro hezrou jarilith jovoc kastighur kelvezu klurichir mane marilith maurezhi molydeus myrmyxicus nabassu nalfeshnee orlath palrethee rutterkin skurchur sorrowsworn succubus turagathshnee uridezu vathugu and vrock note the term tanar ri originated with the 2nd edition ad d rules when the words devil and demon were dropped by tsr from all the rulebooks this was due to a shift in tsr policy which aimed to minimize the criticism from religious fundamentalists who percieved the game as being satanic in nature both terms were restored with the release of dungeons and dragons 3rd edition ruleset the term tanar ri was also retained but applied specifically to a narrow subset of demon loumara the loumara are a relatively new demonic race much younger than the tanar ri they are still centuries old but this is still recent in a place like the abyss where time doesn t mean the same thing it does on the material plane as a result no loumara has become powerful enough to be recognized as a demon lord loumara are usually immaterial or invisible demons that are more like ghosts or undead than demons all loumara can possess living creatures known types of loumara include a dybbuk resembles a jellyfish with a simply sketched human face dybbuks can possess and control dead bodies so they spend a lot of time looking for a perfect host body to animate one that died without violence or major injury and preferably one that is handsome or beautiful after taking the control of a perfect body dybbuks try to insert themselves into the society of the victim plunging into depravity and hedonism until their possessed body is broken down and ruined when a perfect body is not available a dybbuk will take a less desirable body and continue to search for a better host dybbuks are lonely creatures and can be found in groups only where there are many corpses to possess such as on a recent battlefield they tend to avoid undead because already animated bodies are of no use to them a guecubu resembles a mass of vapor and is born from dreamstuff tainted by evil guecubus can possess and control the body of sleeping humanoids once they are in control they ride silently letting their victim go about his or her business at some point they take control and lash out trying to spread death and murder particularly the victim s family and friends sometimes the guecubu will conceal its actions even from the victim letting them believe that they are cursed or jinxed guecubus believe that killings form some sort of pattern and enough spilled blood will eventually reveal the meaning of creation in this pattern they rarely form groups with other guecubus preferring to remain hidden and anonymous however many of them can be found in the dreaming gulf 230th layer of the abyss where they are created spontaneously from the raw churning chaos of dreams other demons not all known demons fit into one of the above races such non typed demons include abyssal drake abyssal eviscerator abyssal maw abyssal ravager abyssal skulker ankashar artaaglith bebelith blood fiend broodswarm deathdrinker ghour lilitu nashrou ostego death demon

the revolutionary war began in the 1770s fairfielders were caught in the crisis as much as if not more than the rest of their neighbors in connecticut in a predominantly tory section of the state the people of fairfield were early supporters of the cause for independence throughout the war a constant battle was being fought across long island sound as men from british controlled long island raided the coast in whaleboats and privateers gold selleck silliman whose home still stands on jennings road was put in charge of the coastal defenses in the spring of 1779 he was kidnapped from his home by tory forces in preparation for a british raid on fairfield county his wife watched from their home as on the morning of july 7 1779 approximately 2 000 enemy troops landed on fairfield beach near pine creek point and proceeded to invade the town when they left the following evening the entire town lay in ruins burned to the ground as punishment for fairfield s support of the rebel cause ten years later president george washington noted after traveling through fairfield that the destructive evidences of british cruelty are yet visible both in norwalk and fairfield as there are the chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet fairfield recovered slowly from the burning but soon after the end of the war its houses and public buildings had all been rebuilt twentieth century world war i brought fairfield out of its agrarian past by triggering an unprecedented economic boom in bridgeport the center of a large munitions industry the prosperity created a housing shortage in the city and many of the workers looked to fairfield to build their homes the trolley and later the automobile made the countryside accessible to these newly rich members of the middle class who brought with them new habits new attitudes and new modes of dress the prosperity lasted through the twenties by the time of the stock market crash in 1929 the population had increased to 17 000 from the 6 000 it had been just before the war even during the depression the town kept growing the opening of the connecticut turnpike in the 1950s brought another wave of development to fairfield and by the 1960s the

 id=147115 title president of the people s republic of china nonfiltered 927 processed 918 dbindex 450937 the president of the people s republic of china or abbreviated guóji zh xí is the head of state of the people s republic of china the office was created by the 1982 constitution formally the president is elected by the national people s congress in accordance with article 62 of the constitution in practice this election falls into the category of single candidate elections the candidate is recommended by the presidium of the national people s congress the term zhuxi refers to the chairman in a committee and was translated as such prior to the 1982 constitution as in chairman mao the official translation switched to president after 1982 in conformity with western terminology however zhuxi stayed in chinese and in other contexts still corresponds to chairman in english meanwhile the translation of english term president as the head of other states remained zongtong causing a bit of confusion with regard to usage selection succession and requirements according to the constitution of the people s republic of china the national people s congress npc in theory china s top law making legislature has the power to elect and force the resignation of the president by law the president must be a chinese citizen of 45 years of age or older the president cannot serve for over two terms a term being the equivalent of one session of the npc which is five years the president promulgates statues adopted by the npc and npcsc the president also has the power to appoint the premier vice premiers state council members all ambassadors to foreign countries ministers of all departments and all legislative committee chairs treasurers and secretaries the president has the power to give special presidential decrees and can declare state of emergency and declare war the president is assisted by the vice president in the event that the president dies or leaves office the vice president automatically assumes presidential powers in the event that they both are unable to perform normal duties the chairman of the national people s congress will perform the duties of the president as acting president until the npc can elect a new president the president and the state as the president is legally china s head of state he is responsible for china s foreign affairs since the early 1990s the president has generally been responsible for establishing general policy and direction for the state and leaves responsibility for the implementation details to the premier of the people s republic of china who is the head of government in marked contrast to the system of the soviet union when the president was a powerless figurehead the chinese presidency has grown to be quite a powerful position the president and the party also since the 1990s it has been general practice for the president to also serve as the general secretary of the communist party it is key for the general secretary to seal his power by adding the presidency to his powerful collection of titles this effectively removes any power tension between the top communist leader and the head of state the president and the military the relationship between the president and the military is a bit more murky the potential for conflict is lessened when as during the jiang era the president is also chairman of the state central military commission however there is a source of potential conflict when this is not the case shown by the situation in 2003 when top communist leader hu jintao was elected president without being elected the cmc chair in addition most of the members of both the party and the state central military commission are uniformed senior generals giving the people s liberation army a degree of autonomy this autonomy however is limited by the existence of political officers in principle when the president is also party general secretary he could order the party central military commission to order the state central military commission to do something however how this would work in a crisis is unclear there have been proposals to constitutionally change the system of command to form a national security council modelled after the national security council of the united states which would give the president undisputed command of the military which would then be just another ministry these proposals were not actively discussed because of opposition from senior generals and because such acts would be seen as a political attack against the chairman of the cmc jiang zemin in september 2004 jiang stepped down as chairman of the commission and president hu jintao became the undisputed commander in chief of the armed forces history of the presidency upon the declaration of the people s republic of china in 1949 mao zedong was selected chairman of the people s republic of china mao who was also chairman of the communist party of china and chairman of the central military commission was clearly the most powerful person in china in the constitution of 1954 the president officially translated as chairman of the prc was intended to be very powerful serving both as the head of state and the commander in chief of the armed forces the president had special powers to call upon emergency meetings during a crisis or concerns of national security after his failures in the great leap forward mao decided to give up the state presidency in 1959 he was succeeded to this post by liu shaoqi who along with zhou enlai and deng xiaoping took on a more active role in government to curb the excesses of the great leap forward and restore soviet based centrally planned economy however in 1966 mao launched the cultural revolution to re assert his personal power and overthrow the liu government the state and party apparatus broke down and in 1968 chairman liu shaoqi was arrested and humiliated by the red guards chairman liu died in prison and he was not replaced mao concentrated powers centrally into the hands of the party chairman and the cmc chairman which were further exercised by various revolutionary committees the ceremonial duties associated with the head of state were subsequently passed to the chairman of the national people s congress the national legislature the exact reason why mao zedong refused to reinstate the presidency was unclear however it is now known that mao did not want his political struggle with liu shaoqi to be remembered as his attempt to claim the title of the presidency for himself lin biao then china s number two figure advocated for the reinstatement of the position of president with mao taking the position and himself becoming vice president mao later considered this to be a threat to his power as the vice president can legally succeed the president in the event of the latter s death but during the early 1980s it became clearer that china needed a person to serve as the head of state albeit completely ceremonial soong ching ling the widow of sun yat sen and former vice chairwoman of prc was named to be the honorary president of the prc before the passage of the constitution of 1982 in the constitution of 1982 the president was conceived of as a figurehead head of state with actual state power resting in the hands of the premier of the people s republic of china and the general secretary of the communist party of china both of which were conceived of as being separate people the president will only hold the office of the president and not intervene directly in matters of the state council or the party the president therefore held minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff in the original 1982 constitution plan the party would develop policy the state would execute it and the power would be divided to prevent a cult of personality from forming as it did with the case of mao zedong thus in 1982 china perceivably had four main leaders hu yaobang the party general secretary zhao ziyang the premier li xiannian the president and deng xiaoping the paramount leader holding title of the chairman of the cmc subsequent events however caused the office to have much larger powers than was originally intended in 1989 then president yang shangkun was able in cooperation with the then chairman of the central military commission deng xiaoping to use the office of the president to declare martial law in beijing and order the military crackdown of the tiananmen square protests of 1989 this was in direct opposition to the wishes of party general secretary zhao ziyang and probably a majority of the politburo standing committee in the 1990s the experiment of separating party and state posts which led to bitter division was terminated and in 1992 the post of president was taken by jiang zemin who as general secretary and chief of the central military commission continued to make the office of the president a powerful position when jiang zemin stepped down in 2003 the offices of general secretary and president were once again both given to one man then vice president hu jintao

moved to california programs developed partially or entirely under his direction include wordstar helpdesk and quattro pro among others wordstar was the first truly successful program for the personal computer in a commercial sense and gave access to word processing to the general population for the first time in some ways he might be called the typewriter killer rubinstein began his involvement with microcomputers as director of marketing at imsai prior to this he was a television repairman he currently lives in northern california business ventures rubinstein founded micropro international inc in 1978 micropro was the maker of the wordstar word processor several imsai employees joined him there including rob barnaby creator of the first version of wordstar known as ned bruce van natta joe killian dianne hajicek and glen ewing in 1982 wordstar was ported to ms dos so while wordmaster supersort and wordstar were developed on imsais i used mine til i got an ibm pc few customers used them rob barnaby in email to mike petrie 2 may 2000 in 1987 rubinstein became involved with a spreadsheet called surpass this spreadsheet was later sold to borland international borland international renamed it quattropro in 1990 rubinstein was sued by imsi regarding theft of trade secrets regarding wordstar rubinstein was successfully defended by davis wright tremaine llp in a video history interview with the david allison of the smithsonian institute bill gates referred to rubinstein as starting one of the first software companies in 1995 he founded a company called prompt software to investigate document management internet research and patent a series of discoveries regarding content discovery this software connected to multiple search sites and used complex word algorithms to refine searches one of his most recent associations is with intesoft systems stories about rubinstein according to the book the silicon jungle rubinstein a science fiction fan had once asked author arthur c clarke about the possibility of a briefcase computer tapping into information from anywhere in the world of course clarke had already thought of this and predicted in profiles of the future that businesses would need only the equivalent of a telephone number around the time of this question rubinstein already knew that epson was going to be marketing a lap sized machine with wordstar in rom arthur c clarke credited wordstar with bringing him out of the retirement that he announced in 1978 part of rubinstein s legacy is the invention of the 495 selling price for pc software a price level that ruled the desktop for over a decade according to rubinstein he arrived at this price by walking down fourth street in san rafael going into businesses and asking them what they d be willing to pay for word processing software with wordstar s capabilities quotations i m still searching for nirvana 25 august 1997 improper credit similar to many early pioneers in the software industry rubinstein is sometimes credited with actually writing the software that his companies have marketed some things rubinstein is improperly credited with are development of a basic compiler the real basic compilers of the day were mbasic bill gates big success and cbasic by gordon eubanks rubinstein never had any involvement with a basic compiler he was a cobol man at that time developing wordstar the code was actually written by rob barnaby the base code was originally an imsai program called nuedit which was spiffed up and named wordmaster in san rafael california the features that turned wordmaster a programming editor similar to vi in some ways into wordstar the common man s word processor were mostly rubinstein s seymour was the marketing brains it was he that said we should address word processing to get a larger market the defining change was to add margins and word wrap additional changes included getting rid of command mode and adding a print function i was the technical brains i figured out how to do it and did it and documented it the product s success i think related both to it being the right product seymour and to it being a fairly good implementation given the equipment me rob barnaby in email to mike petrie 3 may 2000 developing quattro pro the original quattro pro was a dos program the development environment a modula 2 compiler and a windowing system and a crude spreadsheet were developed in texas by a company started by bob warfield rubinstein bought that program and hired the developers and brought on bob richardson former chief programmer at micropro to work on the compiler surpass the program name was developed in novato california by bob warfield dave anderson weikuo liaw and bob richardson barnaby from the wordstar days did a minor amount of work as did jim fox surpass was developed by surpass software systems and at one time was a major spreadsheet competitor as measured by p c magazine surpass got great benchmarks and was popular but due to a bad marketing division was never widely sold ingram was given an exclusive on the program but never sold it because lotus was a major source of income for them surpass did not have the money to sue quattro was developed by borland at about the same time sold considerably more units than surpass and was probably profitable for borland but both products were clearly far behind the market leader lotus phillipe kahn saw the chance to double the development team and get some new technology ideas by buying the surpass product at a bargain rate giving him another shot at gaining the lead so the entire operation was sold to borland who moved the development to santa cruz and scott s valley the surpass codebase was converted to c and merged with existing borland code from quattro to form quattro pro an extremely popular program although the features such as hot links were largely first implemented in surpass developing websleuth a widely unknown program the actual code was written by garnet r chaney and bob richardson formerly of wordstar and quattro pro with minor external help from jon hibbins and team with some of the interface design this company suffered from a lack of funding the marketing effort there was spearheaded by penelope lamars the product is still being developed by a new company called intesoft systems rubinstein is a principal in the new

summer and was unevenly distributed the figures were found primarily in target and at online retailers although some wal marts did receive cases and when they did arrive the new figures tended to sell out quickly single packed figures like tomb wraith and storm wing rapidly climbed in value as a result the line ended with wave 4 which was displayed at the san diego comic con in july 2004 the final assortment wave 4 was never released to brick and mortar retailers although a few shops that also had online services did receive the thunder shaman set months after the line was thought to have been written off by hasbro wave 4 figures began appearing in asian stores finally in the summer of 2005 hasbro sold the remaining wave 4 figures to various internet retailers including their own

 id=3596898 title hindu views on monotheism nonfiltered 940 processed 931 dbindex 450951 the very first book of the rig veda 1 164 46 states ekam sad vipraa bahudhaa vadantya truth is one but sages call it by many names monotheistic theology was is an inherent part of hinduism which teach that the many forms of god i e vishnu shiva or devi merely represent aspects of a single or underlying divine power or brahman see articles on nirguna brahman and saguna brahman claims that hinduism never taught polytheism are correct if we read the major texts of hinduism such as the vedas upanishads and gita certain sects of hinduism the smarta view is an inclusive monotheistic view of monotheism as discussed later this smarta view dominates the view of hinduism in the west and has confused all hindus to be seemingly polytheistic the smarta division is the only branch of hinduism that strictly follows this view after all swami vivekananda a follower of ramakrishna along with many others who brought hindu beliefs to the west were all smarta in belief only a smartist would have no problem worshiping shiva or vishnu together as he views the different aspects of god as leading to the same one god god thus according to smarta theology can have a multitude of aspects and thus according to this belief they hold that vishnu and shiva are one and the same god the smarta theologians have cited many references to support this view for example they interpret verses in both the shri rudram the most sacred mantra in shaivism and the vishnu sahasranama one of the most sacred prayers in vaishnavism to show this belief by contrast a vaishnavite considers vishnu as the only one true god worthy of worship and other worship of other forms as subordinate or simply incorrect monotheism can be divided into different types on the basis of its attitude towards polytheism inclusive monotheism claims that all polytheistic deities are just different names for the single monotheistic god smartism a denomination of hinduism follows this belief and holds that god is one but has different aspects and can be called by different names this belief dominate the view of hinduism in the west exclusive monotheism on the other hand claims that these deities are false and distinct from the one god either invented demonic or simply incorrect as vaishnavism a denomination of hinduism regards the worship of anyone other than vishnu exclusive monotheism is a well known tenet in the beliefs of the abrahamic religions in hinduism views are broad and range from monism dualism pantheism panentheism alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars and strict monotheism but are not polytheistic as outsiders perceive the religion to be hinduism has often been confused to be polytheistic as many of hinduism s adherents i e smartas who follow advaita philsophy are monists and view multiple manifestations of the one god or source of being hindu monists see one unity with the personal gods different aspects of only one supreme being like a single beam of light separated into colours by a prism and are valid to worship some of the hindu aspects of god include devi vishnu ganesh and siva it is the smarta view that dominates the view of hinduism in the west after all swami vivekananda a follower of ramakrishna along with many others who brought hindu beliefs to the west were all smarta in belief other denominations of hinduism as described later don t hold this belief strictly and more closely adhere to a western perception of what a monotheistic faith is additionally like judeo christian traditions which believe in angels hindus also believe in less powerful entities such as devas contemporary hinduism is now divided into four major divisions vaishnavism shaivism shaktism and smartism just as jews christians and muslims all believe in one god but differ in their conceptions of him hindus all believe in one god but differ in their conceptions the two primary form of differences are between the two monotheistic religions of vaishnavism which conceives god as vishnu and shaivism which conceives god as shiva other aspects of god are in fact aspects of vishnu or shiva see smartism for more information only a smartist would have no problem worshiping shiva or vishnu together as he views the different aspects of god as leading to the same one god it is the smarta view that dominates the view of hinduism in the west by contrast a vaishnavite considers vishnu as the one true god worthy of worship and other forms as subordinate see for example an illustration of the vaishnavite view of vishnu as the one true god at this link accordingly many vaishnavites for example believe that only vishnu can grant the ultimate aim for mankind moksha see for example this link similarly many shaivites also hold similar beliefs as illustrated at at this link and at this link however even vaisnavites like other hindus have tolerance for other beliefs because lord krishna avatar of vishnu said so in the gita few views illustrate this view of tolerance krishna said whatever deity or form a devotee worships i make his faith steady however their wishes are only granted by me gita 7 21 22 another quote in the gita states o arjuna even those devotees who worship other lesser deities e g devas for example with faith they also worship me but in an improper way because i am the supreme being i alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services seva yajna and lord of the universe gita 9 23 even a vedic verse illustrates this theme of tolerance the vedas are revered in hinduism regardless of denomination for example a well known rig vedic hymn stemming from hinduism states that truth is one though the sages know it variously this is in contrast with some beliefs of other religious traditions where one must believe in god being one aspect and to totally reject or disdain other beliefs smarta view the system prevalent in hinduism is defined by the smartha philosophy this theory allows for the veneration of numberless deities but on the understanding that all of them are but manifestation of the one divine power that ultimate power is termed brahman or atman and is believed to have no specific form name or attribute only a smartha or follower of the advaita philosophy would have no problem worshiping every imaginable deity with equal veneration he views these different deities as being manifestations of the same god other somewhat peripheral hindu sects such as vaishnavism and shaivism conform more closely to a western understanding of what a monotheistic faith is for instance a vaishnavite considers vishnu as being the one and only true god an attitude that resonates with that of the semitic religions however the smartha philosophy defines the mainstream of hinduism and imparts to indic spiritual and religious traditions their renowned liberalism swaminarayana sect view

they are still not worthy of meditation and thus one should not meditate upon them although followers of swaminaryan are slanted towards vaishnavism swaminarayan also believed in a smarta view he adopted panchadevata system five forms of god as per smarta theology for example he also recognized a smarta view in verses 47 84 and the oneness of narayana and shiva should be understood as the vedas have described both to be brahmaroopa or form of brahman i e saguna brahman thus indicating that vishnu and shiva are different forms of the one and same god he concludes in verse 108 and that

1920 after the death of his brother alexander and the electoral defeat of eleftherios venizelos he succeeded to the greek throne on his father s abdication on 27 september 1922 following a failed royalist coup in october 1923 he was asked by the government to leave greece on leave while the national assembly considered the question of the future form of government he complied and left on 19 december 1923 for exile in romania when a republic was proclaimed on 25 march 1924 he was officially deposed stripped of his greek nationality and his property confiscated his wife stayed in bucharest whilst he spent more and more time abroad visiting britain and his mother in florence in 1932 he left romania permanently and moved to britain in greece between 1924 and 1935 there were 23 changes of government a dictatorship and 13 coups by october 1935 prime minister general georgios kondylis had decided that the monarchy should be restored as a means of providing some stability and continuity george refused kondylis s first offer of the throne but eventually accepted after a plebiscite on 3 november 1935 appeared to show that he had overwhelming public support over 95 of the reported votes supported restoration george returned to greek soil on 25 november almost immediately he and kondylis disagreed over the terms of a general amnesty the king wanted to declare and george appointed an interim prime minister professor konstantinos demertzis new elections were held in january which resulted in a hung parliament with the communists who were anti monarchist holding the balance of power a series of unexpected deaths amongst the more well known politicians including kondylis and demertzis as well as the uncertain political situation led to the rise to power of ioannis metaxas on 4 august 1936 george endorsed metaxas s establishment of dictatorship the 4th of august regime despite the regime s quasi fascist tendencies and strong economic ties to nazi germany george was known to have pro british feelings at the start of the world war ii on 28 october 1940 metaxas rejected an italian ultimatum demanding the stationing of italian troops in greece and italy invaded the greeks mounted a successful defense and eventually occupied the southern half of albania but when the germans invaded from bulgaria on 6 april 1941 the greeks were soon driven back on 23 april he and the government left the greek mainland for crete but after the german airborne attack on the island he was evacuated to egypt once again he went into exile to great britain seemingly at the behest of king farouk of egypt and farouk s pro italian ministers during the war he remained the internationally recognized head of state backed by the exiled government and greek forces serving in the middle east in occupied greece however the leftist partisans of the national liberation front eam and national popular liberation army elas now unfettered by metaxas s oppression had become the largest greek resistance movement enjoying considerable popular support as liberation drew nearer however the prospect of the king s return caused dissensions both inside greece and among the greeks abroad although the king effectively renounced the metaxas regime in a radio broadcast a large section of the people and many politians rejected his return on account of his support of the dictatorship in november 1943 george wrote to the prime minister in exile emmanouil tsouderos i shall examine anew the question of the date of my return to greece in agreement with the government either deliberately or accidentally the version released for publication omitted the words of the date creating the impression that george had agreed to a further plebiscite on the monarchy even though a retraction was issued after two changes of prime minister the establishment of a rival communist led government in occupied greece and a mutiny it was agreed in may 1944 that the fate of the monarchy would be decided in a national referendum bowing to allied pressure george was forced to appoint archbishop damaskinos of athens as regent in january 1945 damaskenos immediately appointed a republican dominated government ill exhausted and powerless george bought a lease on a house in chester square belgravia and made a home there with his long time mistress in elections held on 31 march 1946 the monarchist parties won a clear majority of the parliamentary seats and the referendum on the monarchy was set for 1 september between then and the plebiscite the electoral registers were revised under

 id=2170601 title javan tiger nonfiltered 961 processed 952 dbindex 450972 the javan tiger panthera tigris sondaica was a tiger limited to the indonesian island of java it now seems likely that this subspecies was made extinct in the 1980s as a result of hunting and habitat destruction but the extinction of this subspecies was extremely probable from the 1950s onwards when it is thought that fewer than 25 tigers remained in the wild the last specimen was sighted in 1972 a track count in 1979 concluded that three of the tigers were in existence however it is possible that it is not extinct as in the 1990s there were some unverified reports of sightings javan tiger reserves by 1940 the javan tiger had been pushed into remote mountain ranges and forests at this stage some small reserves were set up but these were not large enough and prey species were too low come the mid 1950s only 20 25 tigers remained on java half of these were in the well known ujong kulon wildlife reserve but the 1960s saw all tigers eliminated from this area and also from baluran national park 1972 and the javan tiger count was down to a maximum of seven in the then newly formed meru betiri forest reserve and perhaps five elsewhere meru betiri was rugged and considered this tiger s last chance for survival however even as it was declared a reserve the area was under attack by agricultural development a 1979 census located the tracks of only three tigers substantiated evidence that this tiger is still alive has not been forthcoming since then the exact time of extinction remains unknown but this was probably sometime in the 1980s continued sightings of the javan tiger occasional reports still surface of a few tigers to be found in east java where the forested areas account for almost thirty per cent of the land surface meru betiri national park the least accessible area of the island is located here and considered the most likely area for any remaining javan tigers this park is now coming under threat from three gold mining companies after the discovery of 80 000 tons of gold deposit within the locality despite the continuing claims of sightings it is far more likely that even with full protection and in reserve areas the javan tiger was unable to be saved the tigers are quite likely to be leopards seen from a distance at the present time the world conservation monitoring centre lists this subspecies as having an outstanding query over status rather than extinct and some agencies are carrying out experiments using infrared activated remote cameras in an effort to photograph any tigers authorities are even prepared to initiate the move of several thousand natives should tiger protection require this but until concrete evidence can be produced expert sightings pug marks photographic evidence attacks on people and animals the javan tiger must be considered yet another tiger subspecies which is probably extinct see also trinil tiger sumatran tiger bali tiger references tijgeritorium everything you want to know about tigers endofarticle doc doc

 id=298818 title effects of the automobile on societies nonfiltered 964 processed 955 dbindex 450975 over the course of the 20th century the automobile rapidly developed from an expensive toy for the rich into the de facto standard for passenger transport the development of the automobile built upon the transport revolution started by railways and like the railways introduced sweeping changes in infrastructure manufacturing and legislation the wide reaching effects of automobiles on everyday life have been a subject of much controversy proponents on one end of the spectrum claim the car is a marvel of technology that has brought about unprecedented prosperity while opponents on the other end claim it lead to a mode of urban and suburban planning that discourages walking and human interaction uses large amounts of polluting fuel and drains urban centers of their populations leading to wide spread urban decay and the neglect of once proud and efficient cities economic changes the development of the automobile has caused changes in city planning as well as changing the roles of horses and railroads industry restructuring huge industries devoted only to the automobile were created others were expanded from once trivial insignificance to eminent importance before the internal combustion engine was developed gasoline was a waste product often discarded once the automobile became commonplace the production of gasoline blossomed into a matter of such importance that the governments took action to secure a steady flow of oil the steel industry was already established but the coming of the automobile created huge amounts of business for it the chemical rubber and petroleum industries were remade to suit the needs of the automobile and industries sprang up such as service stations motels and automobile insurance that were completely reliant upon the automobile for their livelihood as automobiles began to travel at higher and higher speeds the sign industry began building larger and larger signs and billboards to draw the attention of drivers some urban areas remain pedestrian friendly with many stores cafes and other attractions yet still have a great deal of motor traffic passing through and hence billboards atop many business buildings a pedestrian in these areas is likely not even to notice the billboards because a pedestrian s attention tends to be focused on the objects in the immediate vicinity infrastructure aside from industries one of the most visible effects the automobile has had on the world is the huge increase in the amount of surfaced roads for example between 1921 and 1941 the united states spent us 40 billion on roads increasing the amount of surfaced road from 387 000 miles 619 000 kilometers to over 1 000 000 miles 1 6 million kilometers which doesn t even take into account road widening with increased road building came loss of habitat for wildlife on a massive scale loss of rural areas and agricultural land to pavement has also been extensive the quality of roads was also improved roads were paved with asphalt and roads with more than one lane on each side became commonplace in addition to federal state and local dollars for roadway construction car use was also encouraged through new zoning laws that required that any new business construct a certain amount of parking based on the size and type of facility the effect of this was to create a massive quantity of free parking spaces and to push businesses further back from the road making it dangerous if not nearly impossible for anyone to visit these businesses using means other than a car many shopping centers and suburbs abandon sidewalks altogether this had the effect of encouraging people to drive even for short trips that might have been walkable thus increasing and solidifying american auto dependency as a result of this change employment opportunities for people who were not wealthy enough to own a car and for people who could not drive due to age or physical disabilities became severely limited technological changes production the assembly line and other methods of mass production were developed when american businessmen began seeking ways to build more automobiles at a lower price the idea of using many small identical parts that could be exchanged for each other was engendered by the president of the cadillac automobile company henry m leland once other automobile makers realized the value of small identical parts that were interchangeable they hired many small machine shops to make identical parts that were then put together at assembly plants because of this replacement parts could easily be sent to car owners this greatly prolonged the life of the automobile making it even more attractive to consumers ransom e olds took the first step towards assembly line production when he had the framework of each automobile pushed on a wooden platform supported by rolling casters henry ford built on this when he used conveyor belts to pull along the bare frame of an automobile while workmen added parts to it that were brought to them by other conveyor belts ford s utilization of the conveyor belt in the factory was inspired by the chicago packing association s disassembly line where workers dressed beef pulled along by an overhead trolley cultural changes prior to the appearance of the automobile horses walking streetcars and bicycles were the major modes of transportation within cities horses require a large amount of care and were therefore kept in public facilities that were usually far from residences the manure they left on the streets also created a sanitation problem the automobile had neither of those disadvantages the automobile made regular medium distance travel more convenient and affordable also in areas without railways because automobiles did not require rest and were faster than horse drawn conveyances people were routinely able to travel farther than in earlier times historically most people never travelled more than a few dozen kilometres from their birthplace in their entire lives the advent of the automobile began the transformation of society in such a way that those who had never travelled that distance were only a tiny minority some experts suggest that many of these changes began during the golden age of the bicycle the preceding era from 1880 1915 changes to urban society beginning in the 1940s most urban environments in united states lost their streetcars cable cars and other forms of light rail to be replaced by diesel burning motor coaches or buses many of these have never returned though some urban communities eventually installed subways another change brought about by the automobile is that modern urban pedestrians must be more alert than their ancestors in the past a pedestrian had to worry about relatively slow moving streetcars or getting kicked in the face by horses or stepping in horse dung with the proliferation of the automobile a pedestrian has to worry about being hit by automobiles at high speeds and breathing noxious exhaust fumes the futurama exhibit at the 1939 new york world s fair showed a city of the future in which pedestrian and automobile traffic was fully grade separated however for cost reasons this vision has never come to pass outside of small scale skyways in a few downtowns the loss of pedestrian scale villages has also disconnected communities people have less contact with their neighbors and rarely walk unless they place a high value on exercise also drivers lose time stuck in traffic jams and today people rarely get the recommended amount of exercise to stay healthy in fact since the 1980s obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the united states in areas with high crime rates people who do exercise usually prefer to do so in the safety of their home or in subscriber only fitness clubs which they drive to and from advent of suburban society because of the automobile the outward growth of cities accelerated and suburbs began developing rapidly for the first time until the advent of the automobile factory workers lived either close to the factory or in high density communities further away connected to the factory by streetcar or rail the automobile and the federal subsides for roads and suburban development that supported car culture allowed people to live in low density communities far from the city center and integrated city neighborhoods the developing suburbs created few local jobs due to single use zoning hence residents commuted longer distances to work each day as the suburbs expanded shopping centers were built in or near suburbs to save residents trips to the city the shopping centers provided goods and services further reducing the need for suburban residents to visit the city finally as the service economy gained importance business parks appeared allowing suburb dwellers to work in the suburbs the automobile caused the decentralisation of cities segregating land use and ethnicities while increasing the ecological footprint of their residents car culture the car had a significant effect on the culture of the middle class automobiles were incorporated into all parts of life from music to books to movies between 1905 and 1908 more than 120 songs were written in which the automobile was the subject the automotive themes of these songs reflected the general culture of the automotive industry sexual adventure liberation from social control and masculine power books centered on motor boys who liberated themselves from the average normal middle class life to travel and seek adventure in the exotic car ownership came to be associated with independence freedom and increased status changes to individual lifestyle in america at the end of the 19th century americans put a great deal of emphasis on personal freedom and individual mobility the automobile encompassed both of these ideals individuality was increased for the automobile owner this individual zeal didn t apply to everyone conservative critics felt that the automobile decreased church attendance increased sexual activity and weakened family unity a popular religious magazine of the day the independent argued that it took away from even more important things it argued for example that middle class men were prone to delay marriage in order to buy an automobile it then argued that the automobile led to an augmented divorce rate due to an increased stress rate over car payments others felt that couples delayed having children or even had fewer children owing to the expense social status the automobile signifies much more to many than simply a mode of transportation henri lefebvre called the automobile the epitome of possessions in the early years when the first automobiles were imported to america from france for the bourgeois and elite the car served as a mark of distinction above all others the automobile rapidly became a symbol of social status and in some cases a fashion item the automobile more than almost any other possession allowed people to flaunt wealth not only was the ownership of an automobile demonstrative of a certain level of income and prestige and still is especially in poorer nations where the automobile isn t ubiquitous it is also highly visible recreation the creation of good roads and dependable automobiles changed recreation and vacations before the automobile resorts were predominantly found near the coast or a railroad once the automobile became abundant resorts sprang up that were off the beaten path resorts appeared in scenic places far away from the hectic life of the cities in the united states national parks became popular tourist attractions and developed designs with automobile travelers in mind safety automobile accidents caused many deaths and injuries especially before automobile safety laws were implemented to this date automobiles remain a major cause of accidental death and injury not to mention emotional stress in comparison to pedestrians or users of mass transit drivers of automobiles are not able to travel as quickly in inner city urban cores they are slightly less vulnerable to mugging but are naturally vulnerable to crimes like carjacking to torts like injuries sustained in car accidents and to the inconvenience of vehicle breakdowns the automobile expanded the role abilities and efficiency of the emergency services such as the response to emergency calls for firefighters or paramedics political changes george monbiot speculates that widespread car culture has shifted voter s preference to the right of the political spectrum he thinks that car culture has contributed to an increase in individualism and fewer social interactions between members of different socioeconomic classes the growth of the suburbs is also considered an important factor suburbs dwellers are more likely to vote conservative than city dwellers since the early days of the automobile automobile manufactures successfully lobbied consecutive governments to build public roads road building was sometimes also influenced by keynesian style political ideologies in europe massive freeway building programs were initiated by a number of socialist governments after ww2 in an attempt to create jobs and make the automobile available to the working classes from the 1970s onwards promotion of the automobile increasingly became a trait of the conservative right margaret thatcher talked of a great car economy and increased government spending on roads conservative parties often attempt to win votes by promising to defend motorists rights car oriented convenience many aspects of daily life in the first world industrialized countries reflect an impulse to make life convenient for car users without having to exit one s car a resident of a typical large north american city may accomplish the following buy gasoline at a gas station in the few areas where full service is still available have the car washed obtain cash from an atm buy many different kinds of fast food buy freshly prepared coffee or other similar beverages deposit mail for delivery by the postal service drop off apparel for dry cleaning pick up and pay for prescription drugs at a pharmacy return library books videotapes or almost any other small object that is regularly lent to the public environmental changes automobiles are a major source of the carbon dioxide that is causing global climate change the total number of cars and light vehicles exclusing heavy trucks on the planet was about 600 million in 2006 this is increasing at the rate of about 50 million a year the average car or light vehicle emits approximately 0 2 kilogramms of carbon dioxide per kilometre in terms of volume that is about 1 cubic metre of carbon dioxide for every 10 kilometres travelled for a large part of its development no consideration was given to concerns such as air pollution destruction caused by road building and the massively increased consumption of limited natural resources most notably petroleum and land certain of these issues are now starting to be addressed in some parts of the world particularly in parts of the european union where there is much scope for tackling these problems for example almost all cities in europe were developed during the

the rebellion by the british colonies in north america from great britain was spurred by a number of taxes and acts that the colonists had no say over this infuriated colonists and started the american revolution which gave inspiration to other revolutions in the atlantic world such as the french haitian latin american and other unsuccessful revolutions colonists in north america were able to start a government of their own because of enlightenment thinking and because they were governing themselves on the state level for many years before the rebellion french revolution this was a

monroe doctrine it stated that the united states would not tolerate any european interference in the western hemisphere this measure was taken in order to safeguard the newfound liberties revolutionaries such as bolivar and hidalgo fought for also it was taken as a precautionary measure against the vast naval might of the united states european contemporaries great britain had little in latin america to lose by this time so they supported the united states policies in the region so that the other european powers wouldn t be able to regain their strength there within latin america simón bolívar attempted to create an american style government in gran colombia geographical barriers made this impossible however and bolívar named himself emperor simón i latin america never did create an unified government because it had too many military rulers and no civilian rulers because every ruler who came to power was from the military caudillos there were countless revolutions which never allowed latin america to become united resulting changes in international policies increased interest in africa growing tensions in europe growth of u s political power organization of american states the notion of closer hemispheric union in the american continent was first put forward by the liberator simón bolívar who at the 1826 congress of panama proposed creating a league of american republics with a common military a mutual defense pact and a supranational parliamentary assembly this meeting was attended by representatives of gran colombia comprising the modern day nations of colombia ecuador panama and venezuela peru the united provinces of central america and mexico but the grandly titled treaty of union league and perpetual confederation was ultimately only ratified by gran colombia bolívar s dream soon foundered irretrievably with civil war in gran colombia the disintegration of central america and the emergence of national rather than continental outlooks in the newly independent american republics the pursuit of regional solidarity and cooperation again came to the forefront in 1889 90 at the first international conference of american states gathered together in washington d c 18 nations resolved to found the international union of american republics served by a permanent secretariat called the commercial bureau of the american republics renamed

 id=272596 title spanish socialist workers party nonfiltered 976 processed 967 dbindex 450987 the spanish socialist workers party commonly abbreviated by its spanish initials psoe partido socialista obrero español is a major party in spain and the second oldest exceeded only by the partido carlista founded in 1833 it is a social democratic party it has had strong ties with the unión general de trabajadores a spanish trade union for decades ugt membership was a requirement for psoe membership during the 1980s though ugt criticised the economic policies of the psoe even calling for a general strike on 14 december of 1988 since the spanish legislative election 2004 on march 14 2004 it is the largest party of government it forms part of the party of european socialists and is a member of the socialist international ideology the psoe was founded with the purpose of representing the interests of the working class born from the industrial revolution with the declared objective of achieving socialism and inspired by the revolutionary principles of marxism nowadays it is a social democratic party early history the psoe was founded on may 2 1879 in madrid by the historical spanish workers leader pablo iglesias the first program of the new political party was passed in an assembly of 40 people on july 20 of that same year although the psoe was rather weak during the late 1800s its active participation in strikes from 1899 to 1902 and especially its electoral coalition with the main republican parties led in 1910 to the election of pablo iglesias as the first socialist representative in the spanish cortes psoe formed part of the spanish government during the second spanish republic and as part of the spanish popular front elected to government in 1936 during the spanish civil war it was divided into three wings a leftist revolutionary marxist wing led by francisco largo caballero a centrist but violence prone led by indalecio prieto and a reformist one led by julian besteiro the dictator francisco franco banned the psoe in 1939 and it was legalised again in 1977 during franco s rule it was persecuted with many leaders militants and supporters being imprisoned assassinated or exiled modern history its 25th congress was held in toulouse in august 1972 in 1974 at its 26th congress in suresnes felipe gonzález was elected secretary general replacing rodolfo llopis ferrándiz gonzález was from the reform wing of the party and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the party the direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in spain who hadn t fought the war llopis led a schism to form the spanish socialist workers party historic psoe h gonzález showed intentions to move the party away from its marxist and socialist background turning the psoe into a social democratic party similar to those of the rest of western europe in 1977 psoe became the official opposition party with 29 2 of the vote and 118 seats in the parliament their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the 6 deputies of the popular socialist party spain agreed to merge with the party in their 27th congress in may 1979 gonzalez resigned because the party would not abandon its marxist character in september the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which gonzález was re elected and the party agreed to end marxism within the party european social democratic parties supported gonzález stand and the german spd granted them money the party symbol was changed from the anvil with the book to the social democratic fist with a rose in the referendum of 1978 psoe supported the spanish constitution which was approved in the 1979 elections they gained 30 5 of the vote and 121 seats remaining the main opposition party on october 28 1982 the psoe was victorious with 48 3 of the vote 10 000 000 total felipe gonzález became prime minister of spain on december 2 a position he held until march 1996 in spite of its appearance as a party with a progressive economic program the psoe combined social reforms with a liberal and capitalist economic policy in the face of this problem the leftist base was disappointed to see their leaders rubbing elbows with the rich and powerful one example would be the marriage between the finance minister miguel boyer and the star of gossip magazines isabel preysler though the party had previously opposed nato after reaching the government most party leaders supported keeping spain inside the organisation the gonzález administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986 calling for a favourable vote and won the administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of north atlantic treaty organisation and nato using the unofficial atlantic alliance terms a symbol of this u turn is javier solana who campaigned against nato but ended years later as its secretary general psoe supported the united states in the first gulf war 1991 the psoe won 1986 1989 and 1993 elections economic crisis corruption scandals and state terrorism against the illegal basque armed group eta eroded the popularity of felipe gonzález and in 1996 the psoe lost the elections to the conservative partido popular pp between 1996 and 2001 the psoe weathered a crisis with gonzalez resigning in 1997 the party suffered a hard defeat in 2000 34 7 it has still remained as the ruling party in the autonomous communities of andalusia extremadura castilla la mancha and asturias in 2001 a new general secretary josé luis rodríguez zapatero was elected renewing the party later the psoe won the municipal elections of 2003 on 13 november 2003 the psoe won the regional election in catalonia through a pact with esquerra republicana de catalunya republican left of catalonia erc left wing pro independence and iniciativa per catalunya initiative for catalonia icv left wing in 2004 the psoe won the spanish legislative elections with almost 43 of the votes following the 11 m terrorist attacks and maintained their lead in the elections to the european parliament in 2005 psoe called for a yes vote on the european constitution it has since legalised same sex marriage and has called for further integration into the eu terms baron unofficial term for the party s regional leaders they can be very powerful especially if they run an autonomous community there have been conflicts between barons and the central directorate some barons are pasqual maragall catalonia who didn t run for re election in 2006 juan carlos rodríguez ibarra extremadura who has also announced that he will not run in his region s next elections and manuel chaves andalusia enrique barón was a psoe minister for industry the surname is a coincidence the term baron is more colloquial than official representing the great power than these persons have in the party compañero companion a term of address among socialists similar to the english term comrade after the social democratization it is out of vogue and used only during campaigns or by the most leftist socialists currents there have been several internal groups within psoe based on personal or ideological affinities some of them have ended with separation from the psoe the failed trial of primary elections for psoe candidates was an attempt to conciliate currents examples of currents are guerristas followers of alfonso

 id=7978 title data encryption standard nonfiltered 979 processed 970 dbindex 450990 the data encryption standard des is a cipher a method for encrypting information selected as an official federal information processing standard fips for the united states in 1976 and which has subsequently enjoyed widespread use internationally the algorithm was initially controversial with classified design elements a relatively short key length and suspicions about a national security agency nsa backdoor des consequently came under intense academic scrutiny and motivated the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis des is now considered to be insecure for many applications this is chiefly due to the 56 bit key size being too small des keys have been broken in less than 24 hours there are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher although they are infeasible to mount in practice the algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of triple des although there are theoretical attacks in recent years the cipher has been superseded by the advanced encryption standard aes in some documentation a distinction is made between des as a standard and the algorithm which is referred to as the dea the data encryption algorithm when spoken des is either spelled out dee ee ess or pronounced as a single syllable dez or dess history of des the origins of des go back to the early 1970s in 1972 after concluding a study on the us government s computer security needs the us standards body nbs national bureau of standards now named nist national institute of standards and technology identified a need for a government wide standard for encrypting unclassified sensitive information accordingly on 15 may 1973 after consulting with the nsa nbs solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria none of the submissions however turned out to be suitable a second request was issued on 27 august 1974 this time ibm submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable a cipher developed during the period 1973 1974 based on an earlier algorithm horst feistel s lucifer cipher the team at ibm involved in cipher design and analysis included feistel walter tuchman don coppersmith alan konheim carl meyer mike matyas roy adler edna grossman bill notz lynn smith and bryant tuckerman nsa s involvement in the design on march 17 1975 the proposed des was published in the federal register public comments were requested and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard there was some criticism from various parties including from public key cryptography pioneers martin hellman and whitfield diffie citing a shortened key length and the mysterious s boxes as evidence of improper interference from the nsa the suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they but no one else could easily read encrypted messages alan konheim one of the designers of des commented we sent the s boxes off to washington they came back and were all different the united states senate select committee on intelligence reviewed the nsa s actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement in the unclassified summary of their findings published in 1978 the committee wrote in the development of des nsa convinced ibm that a reduced key size was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the s box structures and certified that the final des algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness however it also found that nsa did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way ibm invented and designed the algorithm made all pertinent decisions regarding it and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the des was intended another member of the des team walter tuchman is quoted as saying we developed the des algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers the nsa did not dictate a single wire some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the s boxes were allayed in 1990 with the independent discovery and open publication by eli biham and adi shamir of differential cryptanalysis a general method for breaking block ciphers the s boxes of des were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random strongly suggesting that ibm knew about the technique back in the 1970s this was indeed the case in 1994 don coppersmith published the original design criteria for the s boxes according to steven levy ibm watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the nsa to keep the technique secret coppersmith explains that was because cryptanalysis can be a very powerful tool used against many schemes and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security levy quotes walter tuchman hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential we actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes because they were considered u s government classified they said do it so i did it shamir himself commented i would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened the other criticism that the key length was too short was supported by the fact that the reason given by the nsa for reducing the key length from 64 bits to 56 was that the other 8 bits could serve as parity bits which seemed somewhat specious it was widely believed that nsa s decision was motivated by the possibility that they would be able to brute force attack a 56 bit key several years before the rest of the world would the algorithm as a standard despite the criticisms des was approved as a federal standard in november 1976 and published on 15 january 1977 as fips pub 46 authorized for use on all unclassified data it was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983 1988 revised as fips 46 1 1993 fips 46 2 and again in 1998 fips 46 3 the latter prescribing triple des see below on 26 may 2002 des was finally superseded by aes the advanced encryption standard following a public competition see aes process even as of 2004 however des remains in widespread use on 19 may 2005 fips 46 3 was officially withdrawn but nist has approved triple des through the year 2030 for sensitive government information another theoretical attack linear cryptanalysis was published in 1994 but it was a brute force attack in 1998 that demonstrated that des could be attacked very practically and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm these and other methods of cryptanalysis are discussed in more detail later in the article the introduction of des is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography particularly of methods to crack block ciphers according to a nist retrospective about des the des can be said to have jump started the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms in the 1970s there were very few cryptographers except for those in military or intelligence organizations and little academic study of cryptography there are now many active academic cryptologists mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography and commercial information security companies and consultants a generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing that is trying to crack the des algorithm in the words of cryptographer bruce schneier des did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else now there was an algorithm to study an astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the des and the des is the standard against which every symmetric key algorithm since has been compared chronology replacement algorithms concerns about security and the relatively slow operation of des in software motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative block cipher designs which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s for example rc5 blowfish idea newdes safer cast5 and feal most of these designs kept the 64 bit block size of des and could act as a drop in replacement although they typically used a 64 bit or 128 bit key in the ussr the gost 28147 89 algorithm was introduced with a 64 bit block size and a 256 bit key which was also used in russia later des itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme many former des users now use triple des tdes which was described and analysed by one of des s patentees see fips pub 46 3 it involves applying des three times with two 2tdes or three 3tdes different keys tdes is regarded as adequately secure although it is quite slow a less computationally expensive alternative is des x which increases the key size by xoring extra key material before and after des gdes was a des variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis in 2001 after an international competition nist selected a new cipher the advanced encryption standard aes as a replacement the algorithm which was selected as the aes was submitted by its designers under the name rijndael other finalists in the nist aes competition included rc6 serpent mars and twofish description for brevity the following description omits the exact transformations and permutations which specify the algorithm for reference the details can be found in des supplementary material des is the archetypal block cipher an algorithm that takes a fixed length string of plaintext bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another ciphertext bitstring of the same length in the case of des the block size is 64 bits des also uses a key to customize the transformation so that decryption can only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt the key ostensibly consists of 64 bits however only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm eight bits are used solely for checking parity and are thereafter discarded hence the effective key length is 56 bits and it is usually quoted as such like other block ciphers des must be used in a mode of operation if applied to a message longer than 64 bits fips 81 specifies several modes for use with des including one for authentication further comments on the usage of des are contained in fips 74 overall structure the algorithm s overall structure is shown in figure 1 there are 16 identical stages of processing termed rounds there is also an initial and final permutation termed ip and fp which are inverses ip undoes the action of fp and vice versa ip and fp have almost no cryptographic significance but were apparently included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid 1970s hardware before the main rounds the block is divided into two 32 bit halves and processed alternately this criss crossing is known as the feistel scheme the feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting the rest of the algorithm is identical this greatly simplifies implementation particularly in hardware as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms the red symbol denotes the exclusive or xor operation the f function scrambles half a block together with some of the key the output from the f function is then combined with the other half of the block and the halves are swapped before the next round after the final round the halves are not swapped this is a feature of the feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes the feistel f function the f function depicted in figure 2 operates on half a block 32 bits at a time and consists of four stages expansion the 32 bit half block is expanded to 48 bits using the expansion permutation denoted e in the diagram by duplicating some of the bits key mixing the result is combined with a subkey using an xor operation sixteen 48 bit subkeys one for each round are derived from the main key using the key schedule described below substitution after mixing in the subkey the block is divided into eight 6 bit pieces before processing by the s boxes or substitution boxes each of the eight s boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non linear transformation provided in the form of a lookup table the s boxes provide the core of the security of des without them the cipher would be linear and trivially breakable permutation finally the 32 outputs from the s boxes are rearranged according to a fixed permutation the p box the alternation of substitution from the s boxes and permutation of bits from the p box and e expansion provides so called confusion and diffusion respectively a concept identified by claude shannon in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher key schedule figure 3 illustrates the key schedule for encryption the algorithm which generates the subkeys initially 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by permuted choice 1 pc 1 the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as parity check bits the 56 bits are then divided into two 28 bit halves each half is thereafter treated separately in successive rounds both halves are rotated left by one or two bits specified for each round and then 48 subkey bits are selected by permuted choice 2 pc 2 24 bits from the left half and 24 from the right the rotations denoted by in the diagram mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys the key schedule for decryption is similar it must generate the keys in the reverse order hence the rotations are to the right rather than the left security and cryptanalysis although more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of des than any other block cipher the most practical attack to date is still a brute force approach various minor cryptanalytic properties are known and three theoretical attacks are possible which while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute force attack require an unrealistic amount of known or chosen plaintext to carry out and are not a concern in practice in spite of all the criticism and weaknesses of des there is no known example of anyone actually suffering monetary losses because of des security limitations brute force attack for any cipher the most basic method of attack is brute force trying every possible key in turn the length of the key determines the number of possible keys and hence the feasibility of this approach for des questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on even before it was adopted as a standard and it was the small key size rather than theoretical cryptanalysis which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm it is known that the nsa encouraged if not persuaded ibm to reduce the key size from 128 to 64 bits and from there to 56 bits this is often taken as an indication that the nsa possessed enough computer power to break keys of this length even in the mid 1970s in academia various proposals for a des cracking machine were advanced in 1977 diffie and hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated us 20 million which could find a des key in a single day by 1993 wiener had proposed a key search machine costing us 1 million which would find a key within 7 hours however none of these early proposals were ever implemented at least no implementations were publicly acknowledged the vulnerability of des was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s in 1997 rsa security sponsored a series of contests offering a 10 000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with des for the contest that contest was won by the deschall project led by rocke verser matt curtin and justin dolske using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the internet the feasibility of cracking des quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom des cracker was built by the electronic frontier foundation eff a cyberspace civil rights group at the cost of approximately us 250 000 see eff des cracker their motivation was to show that des was breakable in practice as well as in theory there are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes showing them a physical machine that can crack des in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to des the machine brute forced a key in a little more than 2 days search at about the same time at least one attorney from the us justice department was announcing that des was unbreakable the only other confirmed des cracker was the copacobana machine cost optimized parallel code breaker built more recently by teams of the universities of bochum and kiel both in germany unlike the eff machine copacobana consist of commercially available reconfigurable integrated circuits 120 of these fpgas of type xilinx spartan3 1000 run in parallel they are grouped in 20 dimm modules each containing 6 fpgas the use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine applicable to other code breaking tasks as well the figure shows a full sized copacobana one of the more interesting aspects of copacobana is its cost factor one machine can be built for approximately 10 000 the cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the eff machine is an impressive example for the continuous improvement of digital hardware interestingly moore s law predicts an improvement of about 32 since about 8 years have passed between the design of the two machines which allows for about five doublings of computer power or 5 reductions by 50 of the cost for doing the same computation attacks faster than brute force there are three attacks known that can break the full sixteen rounds of des with less complexity than a brute force search differential cryptanalysis dc linear cryptanalysis lc and davies attack however the attacks are theoretical and are infeasible to mount in practice these types of attack are sometimes termed certificational weaknesses differential cryptanalysis was discovered in the late 1980s by eli biham and adi shamir although it was known earlier to both ibm and the nsa and kept secret to break the full 16 rounds differential cryptanalysis requires 247 chosen plaintexts des was designed to be resistant to dc linear cryptanalysis was discovered by mitsuru matsui and needs 243 known plaintexts matsui 1993 the method was implemented matsui 1994 and was the first experimental cryptanalysis of des to be reported there is no evidence that des was tailored to be resistant to this type of attack a generalisation of lc multiple linear cryptanalysis was suggested in 1994 kaliski and robshaw and was further refined by biryukov et al 2004 their analysis suggests that multiple linear approximations could be used to reduce the data requirements of the attack by at least a factor of 4 i e 241 instead of 243 a similar reduction in data complexity can be obtained in a chosen plaintext variant of linear cryptanalysis knudsen and mathiassen 2000 junod 2001 performed several experiments to determine the actual time complexity of linear cryptanalysis and reported that it was somewhat faster than predicted requiring time equivalent to 239 241 des evaluations improved davies attack while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes davies attack is a specialised technique for des first suggested by donald davies in the eighties and improved by biham and biryukov 1997 the most powerful form of the attack requires 250 known plaintexts has a computational complexity of 250 and has a 51 success rate there have also been attacks proposed against reduced round versions of the cipher i e versions of des with fewer than sixteen rounds such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety and how much of a security margin the full version retains differential linear cryptanalysis was proposed by langford and hellman in 1994 and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack an enhanced version of the attack can break 9 round des with 215 8 known plaintexts and has a 229 2 time complexity biham et al 2002 minor cryptanalytic properties des exhibits the complementation property namely that where is the bitwise complement of denotes encryption with key and denote plaintext and ciphertext blocks respectively the complementation property means that the work for a brute force attack could be reduced by a factor of 2 or a single bit under a chosen plaintext assumption des also has four so called weak keys encryption e and decryption d under a weak key have the same effect see involution or equivalently there are also six pairs of semi weak keys encryption with one of the pair of semiweak keys operates identically to decryption with the other or equivalently it is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation either by testing for them explicitly or simply by choosing keys randomly the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible the keys are not really any weaker than any other keys anyway as they do not give an attack any advantage des has also been proved not to be a group or more precisely the set for all possible keys under functional composition is not a group nor close to being a group campbell and wiener 1992 this was an open question for some time and if it had been the case it would have been possible to break des and multiple encryption modes such as triple des would not increase the security it is known that the maximum cryptographic security of des is limited to about 64 bits even when independently choosing all round subkeys instead of deriving them from a key

revolt or muslim rebellion the term is sometimes used to refer to the panthay rebellion in yunnan as well it was an uprising by members of the hui minority from the shaanxi gansu and ningxia provinces of china between 1862 and 1877 the uprising was directed against the qing dynasty and actively encouraged by the leaders of the taiping rebellion when it failed it instigated immigration of some of the dungan people into imperial russia background chinese muslims had been traveling to west asia for many years prior to the hui minorities war in the 18th century several prominent muslim clerics from gansu studied in mecca and yemen under the naqshbandi sufi teachers two different forms of sufism were brought back to northwest china by two charismatic hui sheikhs khafiya also spelt khafiyya or khufiyah h f y associated with the name of ma laichi 1681 1766 and a more radical jahriyya also spelt jahriya jahariyya jahariyah etc zhéhèlíny or zhéhér ny founded by ma mingxin or 1719 1781 the coexisted with the more traditional non sufi sunni practices centered around local mosques and known as gedimu or the khafiya school as well as non sufi gedimu tradition both tolerated by the qing authorities were referred to by them as the old teaching while jahriya viewed as suspect became known as the new teaching disagreements between the adherents of khafiya and jahriya as well as perceived mismanagement corruption and anti muslim attitudes of the qing officials resulted in attempted risings by hui and salar followers of the new teaching in 1781 and 1783 but they were promptly suppressed the course of the rebellion as the taiping troops approached south eastern shaanxi in the spring of 1862 the local han chinese encouraged by the qing government formed tuanlin trad simplfied militias to defend the region against the taipings afraid of the armed han the muslims formed their own tuanlian units according to modern researchers lipman 1998 p 120 121 the muslim rebellion of started in 1862 not as a centralized planned uprising but as coalescing of many local brawls and riots triggered by seemingly trivial causes the prestige of the qing dynasty being low and their armies being busy elsewhere the rebellion that started in the spring of 1862 in the wei river valley was able to spreadly rapidly throughout the southeastern shaanxi by late june 1862 the organized muslim fighter bands were able to besiege xi an which was not relieved by the qing general dolongga duo long a until the fall of 1863 a vast number of muslim refugees from shaanxi fled to gansu some of them formed the eighteen great batallions in eastern gansu intending to fight back to their homes in shaanxi while the hui rebels took over gansu and shaanxi yaqub beg who had fled from kokand khanate in 1865 or 1866 after losing tashkent to the russians set himself up as the ruler in kashgar soon taking over the entire xinjiang in 1867 the qing government sent one of their best officials zuo zongtang a hero of the suppression of the taiping rebellion to shaanxi his forces were ordered to help put down the nian rebellion and he was not able to deal with the muslim rebels until december 1868 zuo s approach was to rehabilitate the region by promoting agriculture especially cotton and grain as well as supporting orthodox confucian education due to the poverty of the region zuo had to rely on financial support from outside the north west after suppressing the rebellion in shaanxi and building up enough grain reserves to feed his army zuo attacked the most important muslim leader ma hualong zuo s troops reached ma s stronghold the city of jinjibao in what was then north eastern gansu in september of 1870 bringing krupp siege guns with him after a sixteen months siege ma hualong was forced to surrender in january of 1871 zuo sentenced ma and over eighty of his officials to death by slicing thousands of muslims were exiled to different parts of china zuo s next target was hezhou now known as linxia the main hui people center west of lanzhou and a key point on the trade route between gansu and tibet hezhou was defended by the muslim forces of ma zhan ao not a jahriya new teaching adherent he was a pragmatic member of the khafiya old teaching movement ready to explore avenues for peaceful coexistence with the qing state after successfully repulsing zuo s offensive against hezhou in 1872 he offered to surrender his stronghold to the empire and offered his assistance to the qing for the duration of the war his diplomatic skills are evidenced by the success he managed achieved in preserving his community while zuo zongtang pacified other areas by moving the muslims elsewhere in the spirit of the xi hui washing off the muslims approach that had been long advocated by some officials in hezhou it were the non muslims whom zuo relocated out of the area the hezhou linxia area remains heavily muslim to this day achieving the status of linxia hui autonomous prefecture under the prc zuo s troops being reinforced by some of the hezhou muslims that have changed sides he now planned to proceed westward along the hexi corridor toward xinjiang however he felt it necessary to first secure his left flank by taking xining which not only had a large muslim community of its own but also sheltered many of the refugees from shaanxi after three months resistance xining fell to zuo s commander liu jintang in the late fall of 1872 the defenders commander ma guiyuan was captured and thousands of armed defenders was killed the muslim population of xining was spared however the shaanxi refugees sheltered there were resettled or arable lands in eastern and southern gansu isolated from other muslim areas despite repeated offers of amnesty many muslims continued to resist at their last gansu stronghold in suzhou now known as jiuquan which sits astride the hexi corridor in the western part of the province the defence of the city was commanded by ma wenlu originially from xining many hui that had retreated from shaanxi were there as well after securing his supply lines zuo besieged suzhou the city in september 1873 with 15 000 troops under his personal command the huis rifles were no match to zuo s siege guns and the fortress fell on october 24 zuo had 7 000 muslims executed and resettled the survivors in southern gansu to ensure that the entire gansu corridor from lanzhou to dunhuang would remain muslim free preventing any possibility of future collusion between the hui of gansu and shanxi and the turkic people now known as uyghurs of xinjiang the rebellion in xinjiang rebels seize the north the muslim uprising spread to central xinjiang in the summer of 1864 when the hui soldiers of the urumqi garrison rebelled large parts of the city were destroyed the tea warehouses burned and any manchus stationed there lost their lives then the rebels started advancing westward thru what is today changji hui autonomous prefecture taking manas east of today s shihezi and wusu by the early august 1864 the hui population of kuldja the main city of the ili valley region rose too perhaps in anticipation of repressions from the authorities kulja s taranchis turkic speaking farmers who were to form later part of the uyghur people joined when the local muslim kazakhs and kyrgyz people felt that the rebels are gained the upper hand they joined it as well on the other hand the buddhist kalmyks and xibe mostly stayed loyal to the qing government after 12 days of heavy fighting in the streets of kulja s chinese town at the time the center of the imperial administration in xinjiang the hui and uyghur rebels started to retreat the local hans seeing the manchus winning joined forces with them however the qing forces counter offensive failed the imperial troops lost their artillery the local qing commander jiangjun ming xu barely escaped capture with the fall of wusu and aksu the qing garrison entrenched in the kulja fortress was completely cut off from the rest of empire controlled territory ming xu had to send his communications to beijing via russia while the qing forces in kulja successfully repelled the next attack of the rebels 12 december 1864 the rebellion kept spreading thru the northern part of the province dzungaria where the kazakhs were glad to take revenge on the kalmyks that used to rule the area in the past for the chinese new year of 1865 the hui leaders of tacheng chuguchak invited the local qing authorities and kalmyk nobles to assemble in the hui mosque in order to swear a mutual oath of peace but once the manchus and kalmyks were in the mosque the huis seized the city armory and started killing the manchus after two days of fighting the muslims were in control of the town while the manchus were besieged in the fortress however with the kalmyk help the manchus were able to retake the tacheng area by the fall of 1865 this time it was the huis turn to be locked up in the mosque the fighting resulted in the utter destruction of tacheng and the surviving residents fleeing the town both the qing government in beijing and the beleaguered kulja officials asked the russian for assistance against the rebellion via russian envoy in beijing g a vlangali and via the russian commander in semirechye general gerasim kolapakovsky respectively the russians however were diplomatically non committal on the one hand as vlangali wrote to saint petersburg a complete refusal would be bad for russia s relations with beijing on the other hand as russian generals in central asia felt seriously helping china against xinjiang s muslims would do nothing to improve russia s problems with its own new muslim subjects and in case the rebellion were to succeed and form a permanent hui stete having been on the qing s side would do nothing good for russia s relations with that new neighbor the decision was thus made in saint petersburg in 1865 to avoid offering any serious help to the qing beyond agreeing to train chinese soldiers in siberia should they send any and to sell some grain to the defenders of kuldja on credit the main priority of russian government was in guarding its border with china and preventing any possibility of the spread of the rebellion into russia s own domain considering that offense is the best defense kolpakovsky suggested to his superiors in february 1865 that russia should go beyond defending its border and move in force into xinjiang s border area seizing chuguchak kulja and kashgar and colonizing the area with russian settlers all to better protect the romanovs empire s other domains the time was not ripe for such an adventure however as foreign minister gorchakov noted such a breach of neutrality would be not a good thing if china does recover its rebel provinces after all meanwhile the qing forces in the ili valley did not fare well in april 1865 the town of bayandai some 10 km northwest of kulja fell to the rebels after three months siege its 8 000 manchu xibe and solon defenders were massacred and two survivors their ears and noses cut off sent to kulja qing s last stronghold in the valley to tell the jiangjun about the fate of bayndai most of the city of kulja fell to the hui rebels on january 20 1866 most of the residents and garrison perished some 700 rebels died as well ming xu still holding out in the kulja citadel with the remainder of his troops but having run out of food sent a delegation to the rebels bearing a gift of 40 sycees of silver and four boxes of green tea and offering to surrender provided the rebels guarantee their lives and allow them to keep their allegiance to the qing government 12 manchu officials with their families left the citadell along with the delegation the huis and uyghurs received the delegation and allowed them to settle in the old town of kulja however they would not accept ming xu s condition requiring that he surrenders immeidatelt and recognizes the authority of the rebels ming xu refusing these conditions the rebels proceeded to storm the citadel at once on march 3 the rebels having broken into the citadel ming xu assembled his family and staff in his mansion and blew it up dying under its ruins this was the end for the time being of the qing rule in the ili valley kashgaria in the tarim basin the mostly uyghur part of xinjiang south of tian shan the area then commonly known as west turkestan the rebellion started in 1863 fairly independently from the hui uprising in heartland china and northern xinjiang it was first led by the khoja member of a kashgar ruling clan buzurg khan son of jehangir khoja who had lead the previous major kashgar rebellion in the 1820s the flight of the dungans to russian empire the failure of the uprising led to some immigration of hui people into the imperial russia according to rimsky korsakoff 1992 three separate groups of the hui people fled to russian empire across the tian shan mountains during the exceptionally severe winter of 1877 78 the first group of some 1000 people originally from turfan in xinjiang led by ma daren also known as ma da lao ye reached osh in southern kyrgyzstan the second group of 1130 people originally from didaozhou in gansu led by ahong a yelaoren were settled in the spring of 1878 in the village of yardyk some 15 km from karakol in eastern kyrgyzstan they numbered 1130 on arrival the third group originally from shaanxi led by bai yanhu also spelt bo yanhu 1829 1882 one of the leaders of the rebellion were settled in the village of karakunuz now masanchi is modern zhambyl province of kazkhstan masanchi is located on the northern kazakh side of the chu river 8 km north from the city tokmak in north western kyrgyzstan this group numbered 3314 on arrival another wave of immigration followed in the early 1880s in accordance with the terms of the treaty of saint petersburg signed in february 1881 which required the withdrawal of the russian troops from the upper ili basin the kulja area the hui and taranchi uighur people of the region were allowed to opt for moving to the russian side of the border most choose that option according to the russian statistics 4 682 hui moved to russian empire under the treaty they migrated in many small groups between 1881 83 settling in the village of sokuluk some 30 km west of bishkek as well as in a number of points between the chinese border and sokuluk in south eastern kazakhstan and northern kyrgyzstan the descendants of these rebels and refugees still live in

achieve the same ends to tell the world the truth it was created first to educate korean american students throughout the united states about the sufferings of the north korean people and the political context in which they are situated link has since expanded and is no longer limited to koreans to the united states or to college students history beginning in 2001 as more and more north korean refugees made the harsh and dangerous trek to free nations information about the north korean human rights and humanitarian crisis began to spread all over the world defectors began to testify before major institutions internationally from the united states senate to united nations hearings korean american leaders adrian hong and paul kim were moved by reports of severe human rights abuses widespread malnourishment and the tragic plight of refugees in china and decided they had to spread the word about the crisis that following spring at the eighteenth annual korean american students conference kascon xviii held at yale university they arranged for the conference to feature several special seminars on north korea including a special talk by a north korean defector video clips of the escape attempts by north korean refugees and panel discussions on various aspects of the north korea crisis nearly 800 korean american leaders were present including over 50 distinguished speakers experts and important figures link was officially founded on march 27 2004 the final day of the conference the organization immediately spread across a wide collegiate network of korean american student leaders marking 40 chapters within one month of launching as the organization spread leaders began to raise awareness about the human rights crisis on their local cities and campuses as link leaders began to get more and more involved in the issue they began to realize that raising awareness was not enough little was being done to address the issue and existing groups combating the crisis

ten thousand orphaned children in china mostly because their parents either abandoned them in a desperate attempt to increase their chances for survival or were repatriated to north korea because the

 id=172228 title transrapid nonfiltered 1079 processed 1069 dbindex 451092 a work in progress translation of the transrapid article from german to english is currently underway if you are confident enough in your fluency of german and english please feel free to assist with this translation original article in german current translation in english transrapid german transrapid is a german monorail system using magnetic levitation based on a patent from 1934 planning of an actual transrapid system started in 1969 the test facility for the system in emsland germany was completed in 1987 and on the 17th june 1993 the transrapid tr 07 vehicle reached a record breaking speed of 450 kilometers per hour today the maximum design speed has exceeded the 500 km h 310 mph mark and currently stands at about 550 km h with the fastest and currently the only operational scheduled passenger service reaching 430 km h between longyang road station and pudong international airport in shanghai china the system is developed and marketed by transrapid international a joint venture of the german companies siemens ag and thyssenkrupp technology see also technology in the magnetic levitation train article the synchronous longstator linear motor of the transrapid maglev system is used both for propulsion and braking it functions like a rotating electric motor whose stator is cut open and stretched along under the guideway inside the motor windings alternating current generates a magnetic traveling field which moves the vehicle without contact the support magnets in the vehicle function as the excitation portion rotor the respective magnetic traveling field works in only one direction and therefore makes moving train collisions less likely as more than one train on the track section would travel in the same direction the superspeed maglev system has no wheels axles transmissions or pantographs it does not roll it hovers electronic systems guarantee that the clearance remains constant nominally 10 mm to hover the transrapid requires less power than its air conditioning equipment the levitation system and all onboard electronics are supplied by the power recovered from harmonic oscillations of magnetic field of the track s linear stator those oscillations being parasitic cannot be used for propulsion anyway at speeds above 80 km h while at lower speeds power is obtained through physical connections to the track in case of power failure of the track s propulsion system transrapid car uses on board backup batteries that can supply power to the levitation system economic and environmental consideration at speeds below 300 km h the transrapid is less energy efficient than a modern high speed train but considerably less noisy it is also capable of climbing significantly steeper tracks rendering it especially suitable for mountainous regions it is possible to flexibly adapt its guideway to the landscape and to have it tightly follow existing roads railroad tracks and power lines therefore no significant interventions in the environment are necessary and pristine landscape is protected furthermore the original use of the landscape under the guideway is still possible farming or grazing for example however track building costs are higher than for conventional high speed trains construction costs building a maglev track is much more costly than a comparatively high speed railway hsr line if the terrain is flat and still slightly more costly if low mountain ranges have to be crossed this is because of the more elaborate maglev track on the other hand there is little if any additional cost for crossing traffic of any kind and the impact on the environment is also much smaller although they are not powered the maglev vehicles cost much more than conventional high speed trains in comparison maglev technology may have equal or only slightly higher costs once the time saving benefits of a faster trip are taken into account thus maglev technology gives a favorable ratio of travel time to infrastructure costs however due to its high costs passenger comfort may be compromised as interior seating takes on more of a commercial jet aircraft configuration than a typical passenger train one one important consideration is that on a daily basis each guideway must be taken off line for approximately four hours for inspection maintenance costs while maglev costs more in terms of the overall project expenses it saves in maintenance efforts and costs as well as energy consumption as the transrapid levitates and moves using contactless technology with minimal moving parts even though there is currently no long time experience drawn from any commercial application simulations and first data obtained from the shanghai project currently support the assumptions implementations germany high speed competition the transrapid originated as one of the competing concepts for new land based high speed public transportation for germany another competing concept was the intercityexpress ice the ice won in that it was adopted nationwide in germany it is argued that the ice won out in part because of its ability to run on conventional tracks and railway stations nevertheless the transrapid was seen as the next step beyond the ice and a major asset for possible export and consequently development was not scrapped at this point but continued as well however in the 1990s intense political discussions about the transrapid started in germany though technically superior to normal railroad systems the transrapid was considered too expensive as the companies developing it relied on federal subsidies the controversy mostly raged over the question whether public money should be invested in construction of a track for commercial use plans for a track from berlin to hamburg were canceled because legislators were not convinced that the project would ever become profitable in competition to the existing very old and slow conventional railway line and hence were unwilling to invest the money in times of tight budgets in spite of the alleged importance of having a working transrapid system in germany in order to ease marketing of the system abroad some even got as far as arguing that the transrapid was generally unsuitable for germany itself because of germany s many larger and relatively close cities with the resulting many stops at short intervals the time needed to repeatedly accelerate to operation speed and to decelerate before stations becomes a limiting factor in average travel speed for high speed transportation systems and that a demonstration line would be better situated in a country where distances between cities are far larger than in germany this argument however is flawed in that the transrapid provides much better acceleration than any hsr alternative does with both in their standard i e commercially viable and operational configurations and subsequently can show its advantages as much with closely spaced cities acceleration advantage as with largely spaced cities top speed advantage china the only success so far was in the year 2000 when the chinese government ordered a transrapid track to be built connecting shanghai to its pudong international airport it was inaugurated in 2002 regular daily trips started in march 2004 however low passenger numbers due to the remoteness of the terminal station from the city center and high ticket costs hampered the line during the first week the average number of riders per train was only 73 people while the maximum seating capacity is 440 passengers one way trip prices have since been reduced to 50 renminbi 6 usd nevertheless the shanghai project was designed primarily to demonstrate the state of the art technology and capabilities of the transrapid system a high tilt compared with a relatively high speed of 430 km h 267 mph and leaving passengers in the outskirts of pudong shows that the chinese authorities were more interested in the technology transfer than commercial success however in terms of safety reliability availability and functionality the transrapid maglev system has demonstrated the readiness of this technology for commercial applications the transrapid manufacturers hoped to obtain a subsequent order from china for a track connecting shanghai with beijing hence it was considered a serious drawback when in 2004 it is said that china considered to choose the japanese high speed train shinkansen to the disappointment of siemens which had hoped to sell at least the ice which is manufactured by them as the transrapid system partly is public disapproval of the idea shifted the decision further into the future in 2006 transrapid was officially excluded from the debate even though the actual technology to be used remained undecided in november 2004 talks began about extending the track from shanghai to hangzhou 180 km away a maglev would shorten the travel time to less than a fifth of its current value from 2 hours to 27 minutes on february 26th transrapid officials confided to german reporters that they had received initial approval for the line extension to hangzhou although they were quick to point out this is the first approval of many required for construction of an extension line the extension was completely approved in 2006 however disagreements about technology ownership and political interest continue to hamper the progress of the project germany approval is being sought for a 28 km transrapid connection from the bavarian capital munich to munich international airport the approval is currently in the hearing phase and will face objections from residents along the route such a connection would reduce the travel time from the current 40 minutes via munich s bahn german suburban rail system to 15 minutes united kingdom the transrapid is also being considered by the uk government as a 500 km h 310 mph link between london and glasgow via birmingham manchester leeds newcastle and edinburgh one of the main advantages of transrapid over high speed rail is cited as the requirement of at least two primary lines by hsr to provide the same reach as a single transrapid route uk ultraspeed the name of the project provides further information on their website the project has already gained considerable acceptance from politicians and local councils in the north of england and scotland including the ceo of first scotrail however many senior rail chiefs as well as network rail in their recent report remain apprehensive towards the idea further information is available in the high speed rail in the united kingdom article projects elsewhere since the 1990s there have been plans for two transrapid lines in the netherlands one circular randstad and one straight zuiderzee line amsterdam groningen some local politicians even envisioned an extension to northern germany via bremen to the then planned connection hamburg berlin the current situation is stalled and if these lines will be built the netherlands probably will choose a conventional system there has been an eu study in the 1990s to co fund a high speed train network for eastern europe using transrapid technology with lines from berlin to warsaw moscow krakow kiev and prague vienna budapest thessaloniki realisation of this huge project in the near future is unlikely in the usa there have been several evaluations for federal funding of pioneering links since 1997 especially on routes from center cities to airport and suburban hubs atlanta las vegas pittsburgh and baltimore washington these routes are shorter than 100 km but could be extended to other cities if successful chattanooga los angeles san diego anaheim and philadelphia new york city boston respectively there have been first talks for a project in the gulf region connecting bahrein qatar uae accidents august 11 2006 fire on august 11 2006 a fire broke out on the shanghai commercial transrapid shortly after leaving the longyang terminal this was the first accident on a maglev train in commercial operation passengers were able to disembark the train safely and no casualties were reported the fire was thought to have originated below the passenger compartment possibly as a result of battery malfunction september 22 2006 accident on september 22 2006 an elevated transrapid train collided with a maintenance vehicle on a test run at 170 kilometers per hour in lathen lower saxony north western germany the train did not derail the maintenance vehicle destroyed the first section of the train and came to rest on its roof this was the first major accident involving a transrapid train most of the passengers were in the first of the three sections of the transrapid the news media is reporting 23 fatalities and several severely injured after end of salvage work these being the first ever fatalies on any maglev there were two men on the maintenance vehicle they saw the train approaching and jumped to the ground this was four or five metres down a minor fall the passengers on the train had no way to escape and those that survived were evacuated by emergency personnel the accident is reported to have been caused by a combination of human error and a technical flaw the maintenance vehicle carried out routine sweeps of the track to remove debris fallen branches etc and is supposed to report back to the control centre via voice radio once it has cleared the track control personnel should not allow the main train to depart the station before the maintenance vehicle has cleared but it appears that they failed to check the maintenance vehicle s position before the transrapid vehicle departed the compounding technical flaw was that although transrapid vehicles on the guideway are automatically tracked and controlled by the ocs the maintenance vehicle did not operate in the same way and thus was not known to the computerized control system had the maintenance vehicle reported its position electronically as all transrapid trains do redundant computerized safety systems would never have allowed the passenger vehicle to approach the test track in lathen is very simple it consists of a main track and a single station with a side track when you are in the station it is easy to see whether the maintenance vehicle is somewhere on the track if it is not parked in the station it must be somewhere else the accident had also alarmed shanghai china which also have their maglev train facilities built by transrapid alleged theft of transrapid technology in an incident in december 2004 chinese engineers entered into the transrapid maintenance room in the middle of the night in shanghai took measurements of the train and even filmed the whole incident according to the german economic weekly wirtschaftswoche wirtschaftswoche further speculated that it was a case of transrapid technology theft furthering the transrapid consortium s unease the chengdu aircraft industry group has announced it has developed its own high speed maglev technology which it claims to be superior to that of transrapid s less than two years after the break in trials are supposed to begin this year of the new chinese maglev technology in shanghai according to the spiegel online however the chengdu aircraft industry group has been tinkering with maglev technology since 1986 so it is unknown if the maglev train about to run test trials in shanghai is the result of technology theft or actual domestic research culminating in the creation of this new maglev train system or a combination of both however the changchun railway vehicles company announced in 2001 before the transrapid maglev was in operation in shanghai that it was developing a competing maglev system and project in northeastern china it is one of a few chinese companies now extensively and independently researching maglev technology recently new announcements by chinese officials planning on cutting maglev rail costs by a third have stirred some strong comments by various german officials and more diplomatic statements of concern from transrapid officials the deutsche welle reports that the china daily quoted the state council encouraging engineers to learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations bavarian premier edmund stoiber commented what s happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft shortly after learning of the new chinese plans to build their own maglev train the premier suggested that the g8 take up the issue of chinese intellectual property rights violations at their next meeting the china aviation industry corporation said in their defense that the new zhui feng maglev train is not based or dependent on foreign technology they claim it is not only a much lighter train but also has a much more advanced design see also for an overview of competitors to

grandma s real name is not known since she is andy s mother her last name wouldn t be fox but rather andy s maiden name the two appeared to have made peace on their first meeting but affairs have

jason and marcus the four eventually formed an ultra secret friendship club while at camp something the two boys have had varying cause to regret since then eugene wu phoebe s arrogant and egotistical brother his friends call him the brain or at least they would if he had any friends he once arrived in jason and marcus s neighborhood along with his sister phoebe and succeeded in breaking jason marcus eileen and phoebe s friendship club by stealing phoebe s camp journal and planting clues incriminating various members of the club it is implied that an iq test showed that phoebe is technically smarter than eugene and as a result eugene struggles to prove that he is not inferior to his sister according to him this is because of the margin of error on the test katherine katie o dell is the toddler daughter of the eccentric mrs o dell for whom paige often babysits she is portrayed as being a typical hyperactive toddler who makes a fuss and spits her food out all over paige s face when she is fed and who is obsessed with blue s clues never seen behaving normally the little girl has turned out to be too much for paige to handle on many occasions once katie overheard an expletive uttered on the jerzy spaniel a takeoff on jerry springer the only time it was nicknamed talk show while paige was watching and proceeded to say the offending word over and over causing paige to swear in front of katie katie begins to repeat both words and paige manages to get into major trouble with mrs o dell she was only paid a penny for that babysitting session on another occasion

what happened to his comic strip that was going to appear in the school newspaper slug man and leech boy are comic book characters created by jason in a batman parody though slug man s appearance seems more akin to superman slug man and leech boy are almost always fighting their arch enemy paige o tron the most evil robot in the universe although they once were said to have had an epic battle with gargantutron monstrous cookie last summer jason has tried to sell slug man and leech boy merchandise several times he has also made slug man wall calendars and once wallpapered his room with slug man comics there is an entire slug man comic the adventures of slug man the final confrontation iii at the end of the foxtrot en masse anthology which also features a fake advertisement for slug man products all made by jason bill amend has a slug man computer game based on joust available on his web site characters who no longer appear in the strip pierre is a perfect french lover who only appears in paige s daydreams usually his appearance occurs at the same time jason does something she would freak out at for example if paige is dreaming of kissing pierre in actuality it might be jason holding quincy up to her lips usually all paige says to pierre s antics is ooo pierre pierre fans should look to pages 187 192 of enormously foxtrot there is a special collection of paige and pierre art panels however pierre has not made a new appearance since the strip of july 5 1998 fred is a coworker of roger s fred often plays golf with him and always wins and roger apparently considers fred to be well informed about all things popular he hasn t appeared in the strip since the early years but he is mentioned every so often fauntleroy a bull terrier peter had to baby sit a few occasions although fauntleroy is tiny peter always gets numerous bites scratches peter always refers to the dog as a canine piranha however peter never figured that the dog was merely reacting to the smell of soap he had been using earlier all natural beef tallow and therefore continued to think fauntleroy only thought of him as a human pin cushion linda downer peter s unrequited crush before he met denise has not appeared since 1988 apparently a friend of paige the geometry demon a small winged demon who once showed up to torment paige during her geometry homework paige quickly took care of him by smashing him between the pages of her book miss grinchley jason and marcus teacher before miss o malley despite her name she does not seem reminiscent of the grinch it is implied that she used to go bonkers in response to jason s antics in class which of course encouraged jason to misbehave even more miss o malley replaced miss grinchley after she retired in 1991 chris morrissey a senior student who took paige to the prom in 1989 despite peter s objections chris is a male chauvinist as shown by his sexual harassment towards paige at the dance and when he s driving her home

janitor at jason s school he had to help jason clean up his desk after drawing a slug man cartoon on it but before they cleaned it jason had larry help him photocopy the cartoon skip riley roger s summer intern in 1990 the ultimate sycophant who even called roger his light and inspiration before jumping ship to become an intern for charles diggs the head of roger s department the amount of time roger and skip spent together made peter intensely jealous but roger didn t realize until after skip had left him how much he d hurt peter s feelings mr krimpshaw the vice principal of the high school that peter and paige attend he showed up one time when peter punched mike barnes nose to bleeding in response to mike teasing peter about denise s blindness he scared the tar out of peter by telling him that part of the punishment for his violent action would entail krimpshaw calling peter s parents squishy and squashy the talking roadkill brothers the titular characters of a comic strip that jason did for his school newspaper in 1992 with the intent of making merchandising profit off of it they were never actually seen but jason has revealed that they were secretly vampires unfortunately for jason censorship prevented the strip from running mindy a girl in peter s english class who wanted to go to the school s holiday formal in december 1993 seeing how denise was going to visit her grandmother peter having already paid for his tux limo and dinner reservations was torn between taking mindy out and not hurting denise s feelings in the end mindy ended up falling in love with steve gretchen miss o malley s unseen boa constrictor whom jason wrote a valentine for in 1994 andy stumbled upon jason s valentine for her and thought gretchen was a girl in jason s school upon finding out that gretchen was a snake andy told jason that she thought gretchen was a human girl to which jason replied eew gross ick what kind of a weirdo do you think i am tommy smith a boy in paige s biology class who took her to the school dance in 1994 it took him a long while to ask her because he is too shy nevertheless he is perhaps paige s only successful date the tamagrouchy paige received a tamagrouchy from her father in august 1997 it is similar to a tamagotchi which requires feeding and care except that it is has a grouchy personality it frequently insults paige and actually has conversations with people which is much more advanced than a normal tamagotchi it has extremely complicated instructions to give it a glass of water you must press buttons a and c together then hold button b for three seconds then tap button c twice then press button a then button c then press button b then do the whole process backward when paige threatened to neglect it and let it die it claimed that unlike tamagotchis tamagrouchys become immortal if neglected paige eventually was so annoyed by the toy that she gave the tamagrouchy to jason to reprogram with somewhat disastrous results for paige mrs defalco mrs defalco only appears in one 1999 strip where jason and marcus are looking at the candy that everybody is buying for halloween so they know where to trick or treat jason says to marcus looks like mrs defalco is loading up on mini snickers and smarties robo pup a pink robot puppy that paige received for christmas one year unlike a usual robotic pet robo pup

 id=210661 title media manipulation nonfiltered 1205 processed 1194 dbindex 451220 media manipulation is an aspect of public relations in which partisans create an image or argument that favours their particular interests such tactics may include the use of logical fallacies and propaganda techniques and often involve the suppression of information or points of view by crowding them out by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments or by simply diverting attention elsewhere as illustrated below many of the more modern mass media manipulation methods are types of distraction on the assumption that the public has a limited attention span distraction types distraction by nationalism see main article at transfer propaganda this is a variant on the traditional ad hominem and bandwagon fallacies applied to entire countries the method is to discredit opposing arguments by appealing to nationalistic pride or memory of past accomplishments or appealing to fear or dislike of a specific country or of foreigners in general it can be very powerful as it discredits foreign journalists the ones that are least easily manipulated by domestic political or corporate interests example you want to know what i really think of the europeans asked the senior united states state department official i think they have been wrong on just about every major international issue for the past 20 years example your idea sounds similar to what they are proposing in turkey are you saying the turks have a better country than us example the only criticisms of this proposed treaty come from the united states but we all know that americans are arrogant and uneducated so their complaints are irrelevant straw man fallacy see main article at straw man the straw man fallacy is the lumping a strong opposition argument together with one or many weak ones to create a simplistic weak argument that can easily be refuted example grouping all opposed to the 2003 invasion of iraq as pacifists so they can be refuted by arguments for war in general as with most persuasion methods it can easily be applied in reverse in this case to group all those who supported the invasion together and label them as warmongers or lackeys of the united states distraction by scapegoat see main article at scapegoat a combination of straw man and ad hominem in which your weakest opponent or easiest to discredit is considered as your only important opponent example if many countries are opposed to our actions but one of them say france is obviously acting out of self interest mention mostly france as with most persuasion methods it can easily be applied in reverse in this case attempting to discredit george w bush in order to discredit the entire coalition against iraq distraction by phenomenon a risky but effective strategy summarized best perhaps by david mamet s 1997 movie wag the dog by which the public can be distracted for long periods of time from an important issue by one which occupies more news time when the strategy works you have a war or other media event taking attention away from misbehaving or crooked leaders when the strategy does not work the leader s misbehavior remains in the press and the war is derided as an attempted distraction us president clinton s involvement in bosnia is often cited as an example to distract attention from the monica lewinsky affair as well as us president george w bush s invasion of iraq other types marginalization see main article at appeal to authority this is a widespread and subtle form of media manipulation simply giving credence only to mainstream sources of information which are also the easiest to manipulate by corporate or political interests since they can be owned or sponsored by them information arguments and objections that come from other sources are simply considered fringe and ignored or their proponents permanently discredited or accused of having their own agenda example i think there are a lot of people out there who feel the way i do but haven t wanted to come forward because they re afraid of being identified with a fringe group langley said i don t believe in all the things that all the anti war groups stand for but we all do share one thing in common i do believe that this war is wrong demonisation of the opposition see obtain disapproval within the article propaganda this is a more general case of distraction by nationalism opposing views are ascribed to an out group or hated group and thus dismissed out of hand this approach carried to extremes becomes a form of suppression as in mccarthyism where anyone disapproving of the government was considered un american and communist and was likely to be denounced example the consignment of almost all dissent to the international jewish conspiracy by nazi germany example labelling all those opposed to neocon policies as left wing making use of existing prejudices against communists example labelling of conservative party of canada mps as republicans or neocons by left wing liberal or ndp members googlewashing see main article at googlewashing this is a new word coined by andrew orlowski of the register in april of 2003 to describe the alleged practice of changing the meaning of a meme in this example second superpower by web publishing a well linked article using the term in an inoffensive manner stripped of its political significance google has also been observed to exclude certain sites from the search function notably google fr and or google de people concerned about

from the manga dragon ball dragon ball z and the anime dragon ball z is a fictional place located on kami s lookout inside the chamber time seems to pass very slowly and there is a higher gravity level than earth s starting at 1 g and increasing proportionally the further out one goes description the room of spirit and time has an entrance at its center located in a central building with two side wings with housing food supplies bathing quarters and sleeping quarters there is no night or day in the room but the surroundings remain a constant bright iridescent white aurora its reflective floor is of undefined area and the room s boundaries are thought to stretch to infinity in all directions even though it appears to have a definite atmosphere limiting its size the room of spirit and time represents a separate dimension from that of earth the time dilation that occurs in the room of spirit and time is one day of real time is equivalent to one year in the room or 1 second of real time is approximately six minutes in the chamber there are dual giant hourglasses of emerald sand adorning the sides of the building that count down a year within the chamber a clock on the dome roof of the main part of the building tells the applicable time in the real world this essentially allows for someone entering the room of spirit and time to get one year worth of intense training in a single day the gravity in the room of spirit and time starts at 1 g at its center and increases proportionally to the distance away from the center i e as one moves further away from the chamber s center the gravity one feels increases goku gohan vegeta and trunks are the only characters shown to go deep into the chamber it isn t shown if piccolo goten or trunks did though it can be assumed at least piccolo did the wooden door entrance is a portal between the earth and the room of spirit and time and is the only way to travel between the two dimensions without ripping holes in the dimensional walls the room can only be entered twice by a person as by the third time the door locks leaving them in nothingness and not allowing anyone else to use the door also their are only enough provisions to accommodate two people for the full year this is commonly misinterpreted as a two person limit overall but it should be noted that in the buu saga four people in total entered through the main door dragon ball z imperfect cell saga vegeta and his son trunks enter the room to train for their attempt to prevent cell from attaining his complete form both train as ascended super saiyans and trunks surpasses his father in brute strength but has issues with not getting in the way of his father s pride so trunks hides his power level trunks unknowingly makes a mistake by using his time in the room of spirit and time to increase his strength while sacrificing his speed and dexterity both vegeta and trunks fail to prevent cell s completion although vegeta deliberately took part in allowing cell to become complete for the sport of fighting him at a more challenging state perfect cell saga goku and his son gohan enter the room in preparation to fight against cell while training with his father gohan becomes a super saiyan becoming the youngest super saiyan of his time they both emerge from the room with a heightened control over their super saiyan transformation they developed an optimization technique to stay in the super saiyan state for long periods of time in order to eliminate the strain from transforming this allowed them to save energy for fighting and worked so well they could even sleep while in super saiyan form this training greatly assisted in gohan s upgrade to super saiyan 2 during the cell games piccolo entered the room for meditation and self training followed by vegeta and trunks entering again increasing their power levels even further although not quite surpassing goku and gohan piccolo reached a level of power equal to or possibly greater than cell in his semi perfect form given he could hold his own against a cell jr a much more powerful foe than semi perfect cell trunks and vegeta s power levels didn t increase near as much as the first time they entered possibly due to the fact that unlike last time they acquired no new forms during this period instead focusing on powering up their regular super saiyan state to its maximum but they still improved enough to put up an evenly matched battle against the cell jrs the room of spirit and time was not used again until after the cell games fusion saga goten trunks and piccolo enter the room of spirit and time to lure in the horrible super buu when buu enters the room trunks and goten use the fusion dance technique to become gotenks they introduce their ghost attack and upgrade themselves to super saiyan while fused during the battle gotenks falsely says he can t win in hopes of creating a more dramatic victory believing the act piccolo destroys the room of spirit and time s entrance leaving no way out buu can t stand the thought of being stuck in the room mostly because of his fondness towards chocolate and the lack of it in this dimension so buu in an intense rage screams at the top of his lungs the scream is so loud that it rips a hole leading back to earth s dimension buu gets out but it s too late for gotenks and piccolo as the portal closes behind him gotenks and piccolo attempt to recreate buu s mad howl and succeed only after gotenks transforms into super saiyan 3 and yells their way out the room of spirit and time is rendered non functional without a door and must be repaired for future use note some could argue that when buu destroyed the lookout in later episodes the room of spirit and time could have been fully repaired because the lookout was wished back damage free note 2 akamatsu ken pays tribute to this training ground in mahou sensei negima albeit a less extreme version wherein one hour outside equals one day

 id=4500197 title ted chippington nonfiltered 1212 processed 1201 dbindex 451227 ted chippington born 1960 is a british stand up comedian and entertainer his act is one in which the conventions of his chosen craft are routinely flouted assuming a diffident on stage persona in contrast to the self confident aura of most comics and delivering his material in a west midlands monotone he eschews observational comedy in favour of anti humour and jokes which are mostly variations on the same theme see examples below interspersed with his own versions of well known songs performed in a similarly listless style this approach has left many audiences bemused or even hostile his legendary expertise at dealing with hecklers comes from frequent practice however ted s deadpan style has also won him a small but devoted following probably his most notable fan is stewart lee who has often cited chippington as the reason he started doing stand up comedy himself and has described ted s act as being a mixture of surrealism and insolent provocation and uncompromising boredom another admirer richard herring talks of chippington s contempt for the very idea of jokes for his part ted who describes his own act as being influenced by lenny bruce and owd grandad piggott says he is an anti comedian and that he only started doing his act to annoy people he has even claimed that his main reason for retiring from the stage in the 1990s was that he was becoming too popular early years born francis smyth in birmingham ted started performing in 1981 under the name eddie chippington before changing to ted due to maturity and baldness he first came to national prominence when a gig he had performed in birmingham in 1984 supporting the fall his favourite band was released by local record label vindaloo on a 7 ep entitled non stop party hits of the 50s 60s and 70s the ep title refers to his penchant for performing his own versions of classic hits including on this occasion his rendering of ottawan s d i s c o the record was played by john peel on his bbc radio one programme a rare privilege for a comedian in 1986 he released an album man in a suitcase a collection of live recordings plus some more songs included his celebrated versions of she loves you and alvin stardust s i feel like buddy holly which reached the top 10 indie album chart she loves you received wider exposure after steve wright repeatedly played it on his radio 1 show which in turn led to the track being released as a single by warner brothers it narrowly failed to make the top 40 but ted claims that the deal with warners earned him 1 000 and a nice curry despite its failure to crack the charts she loves you raised ted s profile considerably and led to numerous media appearances including a turn on the bbc s lunchtime magazine show pebble mill at one thus fulfilling a lifetime s ambition despite having his act rubbished by presenter paul coia he also fielded interviews with the new musical express birmingham s brmb where he managed to thoroughly baffle his interviewer and bizarrely the colour supplement of the mail on sunday he also performed at the glastonbury and reading festivals ted once again came dangerously close to mainstream uk singles chart success with a recording of his theme tune rocking with rita which he performed with his fellow vindaloo artists rob lloyd and the nightingales and we ve got a fuzzbox and we re gonna use it a further single followed with his reading of dion s the wanderer in which the boastfulness of the original lyrics was turned on its head i m not the wanderer i m not the wanderer not too keen on roaming around and around and around in spite of all this chippington s ruthless disregard for the conventions of stand up made him a perennial outcast from the 1980s comedy scene at a time when politically right on performers such as ben elton and harry enfield were at their peak ted who once claimed his favourite comedian was bernard manning struggled to break through to a wider audience however his fans or good mates as ted likes to call them remain convinced of his status as a neglected comedy genius and regard him with an affection that is rarely afforded to stand up comics retirement in 1990 feeling overwhelmed by the media attention ted retired from showbusiness to pursue a career in truck driving in the us this ended ignominiously when his lorry shed its load on the pacific coast highway after this he tried his hand as a cook in various restaurants in mexico before returning to the uk getting married and settling in torquay return to performing in 2006 he started performing again he now styles himself the reverend ted chippington and has ditched his old teddy boy stage outfit in favour of a vicar s dog collar he has also changed much of his material meaning that ted connoisseurs of old who are expecting to hear the railway station joke are likely to be disappointed a cd boxset of ted s earlier work entitled walking down the road has been released on robert lloyd s big print label a tribute to chippington entitled tedstock was held at london s bloomsbury theatre in february 2007 in order to raise money to fund this release the show included performances from stewart lee and richard herring along with fellow ted fans simon munnery the nightingales phill jupitus josie long and stephen carlin simon amstell also appeared but claimed never to have heard of him this event has led to a new flurry of media appearances for chippington including articles in the guardian and the independent

 id=523470 title tupeni baba nonfiltered 1215 processed 1204 dbindex 451230 tupeni lebaivalu baba is a fijian academic and politician who founded the now defunct new labour unity party most members of this party later merged with several other centrist parties to form the fiji democratic party now part of the national alliance party a former professor of education at the university of the south pacific usp he later served as a senior research fellow at the centre for pacific studies at auckland university in new zealand from 2001 to the end of 2005 in the general election scheduled for 6 13 may 2006 baba attempted a political comeback this time on the ticket of the ruling soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua sdl a political switch that generated a considerable degree of public discussion although his bid was unsuccessful he was subsequently appointed to the senate as one of nine nominees of the fijian government political career baba was a founding member of the fiji labour party in the mid 1980s and was elected in 1987 to the house of representatives as a candidate of the labour national federation party coalition which brought timoci bavadra to power a month later the new government was deposed in a coup led by lieutenant colonel sitiveni rabuka baba returned to his academic career taking a post as a lecturer at the university of suva where he remained until 1999 when he was again elected to parliament and became foreign minister and one of two deputy prime ministers in the government of mahendra chaudhry during the coup of 2000 in which most members of the government were kidnapped by george speight baba s courage as one of the hostages earned him considerable public respect baba launched the nlup in june 2001 after resigning from the fiji labour party flp of former prime minister mahendra chaudhry who had been deposed in the fiji coup of 2000 the breach followed months of intra party infighting much of which preceded the coup large numbers of anti chaudhry dissidents followed him out of the party into the new labour unity party baba s departure was thought to be one of the reasons why the labour party lost the elections held to restore democracy in september 2001 its share of the vote among ethnic fijians dropped to around two percent baba s nlup captured two seats although baba himself was not elected during the campaign he called on the electorate not to support his former party warning that a return to a government led by chaudhry could result in another coup for this he was accused of fear mongering life outside politics baba waited until 2005 to reiterate and clarify his reasons for leaving the labour party it was no longer the party he had joined under the leadership of timoci bavadra in the 1980s he said on 18 september 2005 bavadra s vision had been of a multiracial fiji but the present leadership of the party could not see past ethnic boundaries all that was left of bavadra s party was the name he said he expressed disappointment at chaudhry s failure as leader of the opposition to work with prime minister laisenia qarase on matters of national importance saying that when the party negotiated with the government at all it appeared more like a trade union than a political party in a multiethnic country like fiji baba said it was imperative that leaders look beyond ethnic boundaries on 22 december 2005 baba said that he would pursue academic and consultancy work after completing his four year contract at the university of auckland which expired at the end of 2005 he was happy to be away from politics he said and was not inclined to return to it he found recent political trends in fiji depressing especially the polarization of political parties on ethnic lines questioned again by the fiji village news service on 16 february after his return to fiji he refused to be drawn on whether he would contest the 2006 election or not but made it clear that he was no longer affiliated with the flp speight of violence on 15 may 2005 the publication of speight of violence coauthored by baba his wife unaisi nabobo baba a fellow usp academic now completing her ph d at auckland university and journalist michael field generated controversy with the claim that mahendra chaudhry had promised him the prime ministership before and during the 1999 election campaign and that chaudhry had reneged on that promise chaudhry reacted strongly to the allegation saying that no such promise was or would have been made an flp press release called baba was a frustrated and embitterered person who had left the labour party after a failed bid for the leadership speight of violence is based largely on a diary that baba claims to have compiled secretly while held hostage by speight s loyalists but also gives background information from baba s perspective on political events up to and following the coup sdl convert 2006 the fiji times reported on 11 march 2006 that the ruling sdl had approached baba with an invitation to contest the parliamentary election scheduled for 6 13 may under the sdl banner on 18 march the sdl announced that baba had been approved as its candidate for the tamavua samabula open constituency fiji village quoted baba as saying that his decision to join the sdl was motivated by what he called the lack of leadership in the flp flp politicians however poured derision on the move leader mahendra chaudhry said that baba was a deserter and that the sdl must be hard up for candidates to have selected a man like him while deputy leader poseci bune told the fiji sun that he was baffled by the turn of events he used to be a liberal left winger but now he is back to nationalist sdl must be desperate for candidates he surmised fijian political party svt general secretary ema druavesi also expressed disappointment with baba s decision saying he had joined a party lacking the character of a good leadership the fiji times quoted baba on 20 march as saying that the sdl was the only alternative for fiji moving forward he praised its success in reviving the economy he conceded that some of its legislation was controversial but saw it as an attempt to move the country forward he still considered himself a liberal and a socialist he said but insisted that had to be seen in the multiracial context of fiji his former party the flp gave mere lip service to multiracialism he charged i have responded to the request of the sdl party according to the mood of politics because i am fed up of confrontational and negative politics he said personal life baba s had a son viliame and a daughter raijeli with his first wife miriama cagilaba a native of natewa in cakaudrove province in 2002 raijeli married the then chief justice sir timoci tuivaga

the flight for much of the time the shuttle was at the iss the multi purpose logistics module leonardo was mated and accessible to the crew for the transfer of equipment supplies returned experiments and trash three spacewalks were carried out on the mission the third was dependent on sufficient consumables being available and two alternate timelines were planned with and without the final spacewalk there were also additional get ahead tasks planned for the crew to do at the iss if they found themselves with more time than planned one such get ahead task was completed on eva 2 the crew were able to take the majority of one day off during which they explored the iss took photographs and conducted press interviews july 1 launch attempt 1 events throughout the day went according to plan one exception being an abnormal temperature reading on thruster l5l see pre launch concerns the launch window was from 3 48 41 to 3 53 02 p m at 3 42 while in the t 9 built in hold mission control decided to postpone launch because anvil thunderstorm clouds and lightning were detected within 20 miles of the launch area and path launch was rescheduled for july 2 at 3 26 p m sts 121 was the first launch during which nasa took special precautions to deter vultures particularly the local turkey vulture from flying over the area efforts included the swift removal of roadkill and other dead animals from areas around the launch site this followed a near miss during sts 114 july 2 launch attempt 2 again the countdown continued according to schedule with a launch time of 3 26 p m at 9 30 am on july 2 the nasa launch blog reported that the shuttle weather officer forecasts a 70 percent chance of weather prohibiting a launch this afternoon due to thunderstorms and anvil clouds there is a 60 percent chance of weather prohibiting launch should there be a 24 hour turnaround and a 40 percent chance with a 48 hour delay if we scrub today due to weather mission managers will meet later to decide if they want to make a third consecutive launch attempt or stand down for one day and try again on tuesday at 1 14 p m the launch director made a final decision to scrub again due to unfavorable weather conditions the next launch attempt was scheduled for around 2 38 p m on july 4 july 3 no launch attempt the shuttle s fuel cells were replenished to improve the chances of having enough electrical power on orbit to enable the third planned space walk to take place cracks and a region where a piece of foam had come off were discovered in the insulation on the upper part of the external fuel tanks the foam came off a bracket which held an oxygen line in place the fragment that fell off weighed 0 0056 pounds 2 6 grams and according to nasa would not be big enough to damage the shuttle if it were to come off during flight the thermal stresses of repeated filling and emptying the fuel tank with the cryogenic fuel are known to cause a degree of damage to the insulation foam july 4 launch and flight day 1 at 8 35 a m the backup circuit breaker controlling the primary heaters on the segment joints of both solid rocket boosters was noticed to have failed consideration was given to a repair on the pad however this was not done as the heaters are only used in colder weather and the primary heater was functional for the third launch attempt there was only a 20 chance of weather preventing launch according to nasa at 2 37 55 pm eastern daylight time space shuttle discovery launched from the kennedy space center at cape canaveral florida this was the third attempt at launch it was also the first us space shuttle to launch on the united states independence day during and after launch much attention was paid to monitoring the external tank for the loss of insulation foam the shuttle was equipped with a number of new cameras and video was also taken from spotter planes each solid rocket booster contained three cameras one to monitor the separation and two focused on the leading edge the video from these was not to be broadcast but recorded for later retrieval from the solid rocket boosters a further camera was placed on the external tank as during sts 114 to broadcast live images on nasa tv during launch the first thing two of the crew from the mid deck did when the main engines cut out was leave their seats to take photographs and video of the external tank one of the factors that was potentially affecting the choice of day within the launch window was the lighting conditions for this imagery as the sun s slightly different angle on the different days affected the location of shadows on the external tank however the day to day difference in lighting was determined to be relatively unimportant particularly as the lighting conditions depended to a great degree on a more unpredictable factor the degree to which the external tank tumbles on separation during the launch nasa tv broadcast a view from the external tank camera mounted between the shuttle and the external tank unlike the previous two missions no foam breakage or foam pieces were easily seen falling off the tank however upon close inspection of the many cameras covering the launch nasa has revealed several small pieces of debris were seen jetting away from the tank generally though these were seen after the time nasa was most concerned about about 23 minutes into the flight further debris was observed floating beside the orbiter as reported by mission specialist michael fossum his transmission was broadcast live on nasa tv fossum initially described the debris as a 4 5 ft long piece with straps attached a description which would fit a thermal protection system blanket such a blanket was noted to be flapping on the previous mission sts 114 but was not of concern as it protects a section of the vehicle which does not get particularly hot analysis of video images on the ground has indicated that the debris observed was strips of ice formed on the outside of an engine nozzle which sublimated and disintegrated during observation very similar ice formations were seen on earlier missions video analysis also revealed a tile shim which came out during main engine start the orbital maneuvering system thruster in which a heater failed prior to launch see pre launch concerns was warmed by pointing it at the sun thus it was possible to be used during iss rendezvous docking operations july 5 flight day 2 en route to the iss the 50 foot long orbiter boom sensor system obss tipped with two types of lasers and a high resolution television camera was used to inspect the underside of the shuttle for damage particular attention was paid to the leading edges of the shuttle s wings the post mission management team briefing after flight day 2 revealed that the inspections had found that a gap filler was protruding on the port side lower wing not a location of particular concern the gap filler was not from an area which has been modified since sts 114 it had been with the vehicle since 1982 the height and location of the gap filler was to be investigated further and if necessary dealt with using the procedure established and proven by sts 114 during a spacewalk an analysis of the inspections revealed the presence of bird droppings on the leading edge of the right wing the launch director has said he saw droppings in that location before launch during the crew press conference on landing day the crew joked about the bird droppings indicating that they were still present on the orbiter though rather charred july 6 flight day 3 rendezvous with the iss the shuttle performed a rendezvous pitch maneuver prior to docking to allow the iss crew to briefly inspect and photograph the shuttle s heat shield that maneuver began at 1402 gmt an uneventful docking with the space station was performed and upon hatch opening commander steven w lindsey performed a gymnastic roll for the camera and gave a thumbs up thomas reiter officially became a member of the international space station expedition 13 crew shortly after docking the transfer of his personalised soyuz spacecraft seat liner which cushions the landing indicated the official transfer point july 7 flight day 4 the multi purpose logistics module leonardo was mated to the space station s unity module there were concerns that some straps were in the way of the docking equipment but following video inspections of the straps they were determined not to be a problem and docking continued as planned the straps may be removed in the future a number of focused inspections of the shuttle s heat shield has started a second gap filler described as being located near the arrowhead is one of these points this gap filler is thought to be protruding 1 cm the location close to the nose making it of concern due to the potential for early disruption of the boundary layer over the base of the whole vehicle during reentry there are six focused inspections being carried out fewer than were required in sts 114 by the end of day four the gap filler observation was thought to be due to a fabric capping on a tadpole gap filler a ceramic gap filler plate wrapped with fabric along one edge to provide a tighter fit and a smoother surface the results of analysis of data collected by the wing leading edge sensors was discussed in the post mission management meeting briefing at the conclusion of day four the sensors were revealed to have picked up six impacts the maximum g observed was 1 6 g compared to ground testing where of the order of 10 g were required to cause damage nevertheless the inspection team on orbit will be taking a close look at the regions of interest which are on both wings july 8 flight day 5 michael fossum and piers sellers performed a seven and a half hour space walk they evaluated the use of the 50 foot orbital boom sensor system extension to the robotic arm as a work platform in case repairs are needed to the shuttle the first step was to attach the foot restraints to the arm first piers sellers worked alone then mike fossum joined him when both are on the arm they attempted increasingly vigorous operations that simulate various potential repair scenarios initial reports from michael fossum and piers sellers suggested that the boom was damping out motion rapidly making it a good work platform piers sellers said at one point i felt almost no motions at all just a few inches each way very few motions when standing on the boom while it was moving they described it as very smooth fossum had a problem with his 85 foot long safety tether which was damaged after he made a mistake not realising he had left the tether in a locked position he expected it to be automatically drawn tight upon realising the mistake fossum said oh no that s embarrassing the damaged tether had to be switched for a spare the other major task was to make safe a cable cutter on one site of the iss s mobile transporter july 9 flight day 6 the morning s flight plan revision emailed up to the crew contained the following request which many on earth will be able to relate to if possible please keep your inbox sent items and work related folders as clean and empty as possible either by deleting items or moving them to your personal folders this is needed to reduce the time required to uplink new e mail one of the day s highlights was a press conference from orbit with questions from jsc ksc and the esa robotics operations continued with the canadarm2 releasing the mobile transporter from one end while remaining attached with the other end to the destiny module in preparation for the following day s work on the mobile transporter system other preparations for the second space walk continued including the setting up of equipment and cameras additionally a new spacesuit being delivered to the iss was transferred and underwent checkout procedures july 10 flight day 7 sellers and fossum performed a six hour forty seven minute space walk they deployed a spare pump module and replaced a reel of umbilical cable carrying power data and video for operating the station s mobile transporter rail car july 11 flight day 8 the crews prepared for the third and final spacewalk to be conducted during sts 121 s visit to the station expected to begin at 7 13 a m july 12 the astronauts also continued cargo transfers between the shuttle the international space station and the leonardo multi purpose logistics module leonardo arrived with more than 7 400 pounds of equipment and supplies for the station leonardo will be returned friday to the payload bay packed with more than 4 300 pounds of science experiment results unneeded items and trash at 10 35 a m edt president george w bush had a private telephone conversation with the crew during which he told the astronauts that they represent the best of service and exploration and thanked them for the job they are doing pilot mark e kelly suggested during an on orbit press conference that the wake up songs should be made known to the crew before they are woken up by them when he said sometimes we know ahead of time what the music is going to be and who it s for other times it s a complete surprise and you just get woken up by it and have to scrabble around thinking of something profound to say about it july 12 flight day 9 a spacewalk to demonstrate shuttle repair techniques was carried out by sellers and fossum repairs were done on pre damaged samples of heat shield materials brought into space on a special pallet in the payload bay of the shuttle the repairs under test are expected to perform best when the material has been warm and is cooling so the actions were carefully coordinated by mission control with regard to exposure of the samples to the sun while the procedures and noax non oxide adhesive experimental material has been tested in a vacuum on earth the zero g tests are required because of off gases generated by the material and the potential for bubbles to form that could weaken the structure of the repair following a problem on the previous eva where latches on a safer became detached kapton tape was used to ensure the latches remained closed on this eva kapton tape was used rather than the duct tape which the shuttle program calls grey tape as it is smoother piers lost one of the spatulas he was using to put the noax onto the samples of heat shield material as he lost it he said guys i ve got to tell you my spatula s escaped he tried to locate it himself with the assistance of fossum who said don t worry it happens mission controllers saw the spatula float away over the port side of the shuttle payload bay the tool is not expected to cause any problems calculations were conducted and mission control reported to the eva crew that we have no fod foreign object debris hazard in the payload bay piers apologised for letting go of the tool and causing the extra work on the ground associated with calculating whether the loose tool posed a hazard july 13 flight day 10 the space shuttle discovery sts 121 crew enjoyed a well deserved day off after having completed three successful space walks and transferring thousands of pounds of supplies and equipment earlier in the flight events taking place on this day were interviews for both the international space station iss and shuttle crews mission specialist mike fossum received a call from texas governor rick perry who like fossum is a graduate of the texas a m university he mentioned to fossum how proud he was to have the first aggie in space aggies are all up in great arms to have the first aggie in space said perry you are making some history michael later in the afternoon fossum and nowak participated in live interviews with msnbc and fox news live expedition 13 crewmember jeffrey williams confirmed steps and final procedures for closeout of the mplm which will be relocated from the international space station to discovery s payload bay july 14 flight day 11 transfer of leonardo to the shuttle payload bay was completed in preparation for discovery s departure from the international space station wilson and nowak used the iss robotic arm to complete the transfer of the module packed with over 4000 pounds of material to return to earth wilson and nowak also used the shuttle s arm and extension boom to inspect the shuttle s port wing for any signs of micro meteoroid damage while on orbit the other wing and the nose cap will be inspected on flight day twelve following undocking the major discussion on the ground was around a small leak a apu 1 fuel tank pressure decay in either a nitrogen or hydrazine tank in one of the three redundant auxiliary power units which generate hydraulic power for use controlling the flight control surfaces during landing the chances are that it is a nitrogen leak however it is being treated as a hydrazine leak as that is a worst case scenario hydrazine being flammable and corrosive it is possible depending on the way the system behaves during the checkout planned for flight day 12 that the shuttle team will burn off the hydrazine in orbit this would leave hydraulic system one non operational during landing forcing the shuttle to use pyrotechnics for the deployment of landing gear and disabling powered steering of the nose wheel though the vehicle would be controllable on landing through directional braking july 15 flight day 12 space shuttle discovery s sts 121 crew undocked from international space station after a 9 day stay undocking occurred over the pacific ocean just north of new zealand mark kelly flew discovery to a point above the station before performing the final separation burn crew members also used the robotic arm and the orbital boom sensor system to perform final inspections of the starboard wing and shuttle nosecap for any damage that may have been caused by orbital debris while docked with the international space station july 16 flight day 13 troubleshooting of one of the flash evaporator subsystem fes fes pri b was carried out a would be used during reentry but it is desirable to have both functional this was in addition to the usual extensive checkout of all those systems required for reentry ensuring they were functional the main area of concern was apu 1 tests on apu 1 also increased confidence in its integrity to the point where mission controllers decided to use the unit as normal for the re entry other activities included a long series of live press conferences from orbit and preparations for landing which include stowing items on the middeck fitting the seats in place and for the cdr and pilot practising a simulated landing discovery received a clean bill of health on the recent heat shield inspections and was given a go for landing this was relayed to the crew while they were on their midday meal break there were only two very minor deviations from a nominal landing procedure planned apu one may be started early and due to the problems with the heater thermostat on apu 3 the heater would have to be turned off manually by one of the crew this switch will have to be thrown while the crew are suited up in their seats ready for landing the crew said they would mark the switch with grey tape the crew were told that only ksc was to be called up for a landing on the 17 july meaning that in the case of unsuitable weather at ksc on the 17th the landing would have been delayed until the 18th on the 18th edwards air force base was the prime alternative to ksc showers were forecast in the area of ksc on the morning of the 17th the crew were assured that the weather at edwards looked good on both days july 17 flight day

 id=91225 title written chinese nonfiltered 1225 processed 1214 dbindex 451240 written chinese originated some 3 500 years ago in china it employs about 5 000 commonly used characters that each represent a morpheme combinations of characters produce chinese words the writing system is considered to have been a unifying force for much of chinese history transcending differences in spoken language from the time of the qin dynasty onwards a standard written language at first classical chinese and later vernacular chinese has been in place to bridge gaps between the various forms of spoken chinese how the language works unlike english words which are composed of letters written chinese words are made up of characters it is popularly believed that chinese characters represent words in fact however individual characters represent chinese morphemes and their meanings are generally dependent on context most words are composed of two characters though words are commonly made up of one three four or more this is not unique to chinese for instance the english word undoable is made up of three morphemes meaning not do and able in much the same way chinese zuòbùwán undoable is composed of three characters or morphemes meaning do not and finish context and meaning as an example of how a chinese character which does not commonly exist by itself to make a word but is a part of a multi syllable word consider the character zh ng which has a basic meaning of central middle a zh ngx n is a center e g a health center zh ngm izh u is central america zhongguo literally middle kingdom is the chinese word for china and can be used as an abbreviation for china zh ngwén meaning chinese language and zh ngm i meaning zhongguo meiguo sino american when is placed at the end of a subordinate phrase it can mean during or in the act of as in zh ngduàn to interrupt or zh ngdú to be poisoned common chinese words are particularly flexible for instance k on its own has the passive meaning capable of being as in k ch edible but in conjunction with y assumes the active meaning able to as in k y z u able to walk in many cases chinese characters shed their meaning because they are used to transliterate foreign words and names bùshí is george bush and has no association with bù cloth aside from its phonetic value nonetheless an attempt is often made in these phonetic loans to retain some semantic value as in mín qún miniskirt which literally means fascinate you skirt a few chinese characters represent more than one morpheme this too is not unique to chinese english lead represents two different morphemes and words meaning either to guide or conduct or a particular kind of heavy elemental metal and being pronounced differently in either case when a chinese character say represents multiple morphemes it typically is also pronounced differently depending on its meaning in this case the character is pronounced xíng when it means acceptable or to walk but háng when it means profession or row however this need not be the case the chinese particle le actually represents two morphemes indicating either change of state or perfection of action that are pronounced the same way in either case components and the radical just as most words are composed of two or more characters most characters are composed of two or more roots this is an extra layer of indirection not present in alphabetic languages like english historically as with most languages the spoken language developed first and only later did a writing system evolve to denote the spoken language chinese characters were considered to have been formed according to one of six basic principles two principles governed characters composed of only a single root the entire character itself these characters either depicted the object they represented xiàngxíng literally appearance of shape or represented some abstract concept figuratively zh shì literally indication of item an example of is sh u hand whose original form depicted a stick hand with five fingers examples of are shàng up and xià down two other principles governed methods of combining roots to form compound characters one huìyì literally association of meaning signified characters in which the meanings of the component roots were combined to form a compound sense this is the sense in which english speakers are familiar with compound words a chinese example is hào be fond of which is composed of a woman and child however chinese was apparently too rich a language for compounds to be derived solely through fortunately the chinese developed the notion of the rebus in this conception a character was composed essentially of two parts one was a root that indicated the general semantic category of the character the rest of the character was a phonetic component very often a fully fledged character on its own used only for its pronunciation this principle called in chinese xíngsh ng literally shape sound was tremendously productive by some estimates about 90 percent of chinese characters evolved through the principle of the exact figure depends somewhat on the particular lexicon being analyzed but there is certainly no question that most characters are derived in this manner an example is q ng clear which is composed of a root meaning water and a root another character also pronounced q ng two final principles governed how existing characters might assume new meanings strictly speaking these principles do not produce any new characters one is zhu nzhù literally transfer into which covered characters whose original meanings were extended typically metaphorically into newer often more general senses the last principle was ji jiè literally false borrowing in these cases a character with an already established meaning was borrowed to cover a second unrelated morpheme for which there existed as yet no written character looking up a word because written chinese is not an alphabetic language a chinese dictionary uses other methods of arranging words words are grouped into an entry based on its first character each character has a part of it designated a primary root called the radical there is an index of 214 distinct radicals sorted by stroke count and originally selected so that each character in the chinese written system would contain at least one radical and indeed every written character does contain at least one of the 214 radicals some characters contain more than one radical but even in these cases one particular radical is designated as the primary radical for that character in principle looking up a character in the dictionary when its sound is not known is a two step process first one identifies the radical for that character eg the radical in this case as in many characters divided left right is on the left this radical can be located in the index of 214 radicals which are arranged by the number of strokes three in this case the next step is to look in a second index in which every character is sorted by radical in this case all characters with the nü woman radical there are scores of characters with this radical so the characters under each radical are sorted according to the number of strokes in the remainder of the character in this case zi child which also has three strokes then it is a matter of looking down the list until is located which will then give its main entry in the dictionary by pinyin or page number beginning in the 20th century a number of phonetic alphabets were developed for the various chinese dialects for the most common dialect mandarin both p ny n used throughout this article and zhùy n fúhào are used modern dictionaries have the characters arranged by pinyin alphabetical order or include an appendix in which all the characters are sorted according to one of these phonetic alphabets this further simplifies the task of looking up a character if the character s pronunciation is already known for an unknown character the user must still find the character using the radical method in practice looking up characters is complicated by a variety of considerations one is that it is not always obvious what the principal radical is it may occasionally be located on the top bottom right or even inside of another root typically though not always it is a root that represents the semantic category for the character another difficulty is that several common radicals have variant forms which must be recognized in order to find the proper chapter of the dictionary still another problem is that counting strokes is an error laden process some chinese characters require upwards of 30 strokes to write correctly and it is not always easy to determine whether part of a character is to be written with two separate strokes or a single angled one to ease the problem cases somewhat there is typically an appendix containing a list of characters which are difficult to locate sorted strictly by stroke count this still requires the user to count strokes carefully but eliminates the issue of which root is the radical of the character recognizing that radicals are at least somewhat arbitrary in nature some lexicographers devised new schemes for chinese dictionaries most of these are poorly represented in print although the four corner method in which characters are organized according to the kind of strokes used in the four corners of the character has some enthusiastic adherents written chinese the relationship among the chinese spoken and written languages is complex it is compounded by the fact that spoken variations evolved for centuries since at least the late hàn dynasty while written chinese changed less until the 20th century most formal chinese writing was done in classical chinese or literary chinese wényán which was very different from any spoken variety of chinese much as classical latin differs from modern romance languages since the may fourth movement of 1919 the formal standard for written chinese was changed to vernacular chinese báihuà which while not completely identical to the grammar and vocabulary of dialects of mandarin was based mostly on them the term standard written chinese now refers to vernacular chinese chinese characters represent morphemes or part of a morpheme independent of phonetic change for example although the number one is yi in mandarin yat in cantonese and tsit in hokkien form of min they derive from a common ancient chinese word and can be written with an identical character nevertheless the orthographies of chinese dialect groups are not completely identical and their vocabularies have diverged in addition while colloquial vocabularies are often different they also share vocabulary that is derived from the classical written language colloquial non standard written chinese usually involves dialectal characters which are not used in other dialects or characters that are considered archaic in standard written chinese cantonese is unique among non mandarin regional languages in having a written colloquial standard used in hong kong and by non standard mandarin speaking cantonese speakers overseas with a large number of unofficial characters for words particular to this variety of chinese by contrast the other regional languages do not have such widely used alternative written standards written colloquial cantonese has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging although for formal written communications cantonese speakers still normally use standard written chinese also in hunan some women wrote their local language in nü shu a syllabary derived from chinese characters the dungan language considered a dialect of mandarin is also nowadays written in cyrillic and was formerly written in the arabic alphabet although the dungan people live outside china written standards one can classify chinese writing into the following basic types wényán classical chinese poems and other chinese constrained writings the relationship between the chinese spoken and written languages is complex this complexity is compounded by the fact that the numerous variations of spoken chinese have gone through centuries of evolution since at least the late hàn dynasty however written chinese has changed much less than the spoken language until the 20th century most formal chinese writing was done in wényán translated as classical chinese or literary chinese which was very different from any of the spoken varieties of chinese in much the same way that classical latin is different from modern romance languages chinese characters that are closer to the spoken language were used to write informal works such as colloquial novels in the may fourth movement of 1919 the formal standard for written chinese was changed to báihuà or vernacular chinese which while not completely identical to the grammar and vocabulary of standard mandarin was based mostly on the dialects of modern spoken mandarin the term standard written chinese now refers to vernacular chinese although few new works are now written in classical chinese it is still taught in middle and high school and forms part of college entrance examinations classical chinese forms are also sometimes included in written works to give them a highly formal or archaic flavor the chinese script also was the base for some other east asian scripts like the scripts of khitan and jurchen kanji in japan ch nho in vietnam and nushu a script since the 15th century exclusively for chinese women in hunan transcending intelligibility of speech chinese characters are understood as logosyllabic morphemes that are independent of phonetic change thus for example although the number one is y in mandarin yat in cantonese and tsit in hokkien they derive from a common ancient chinese word and are written with the same character nevertheless the orthographies of chinese dialects are not identical the vocabularies used in the different dialects have also diverged in addition while literary vocabulary is often shared among all dialects at least in orthography colloquial vocabularies vary widely colloquially written chinese usually involves the use of dialectal characters which may not be understood in other dialects or characters that are considered archaic in báihuà the complex interaction between the chinese written and spoken languages can be illustrated with cantonese in hong kong cantonese speakers are all taught standard written chinese in school even though its grammar and vocabulary are based on mandarin which is not generally spoken in hong kong as every character in standard written chinese has a cantonese pronunciation standard written chinese can be read aloud using cantonese pronunciation but the result is very different from normal spoken cantonese for cantonese speakers in guangdong province where nearly everyone can also speak mandarin this difference between the written and spoken language is much less pronounced as standard written chinese can be read aloud in its standard pronunciation which is mandarin in most written communication cantonese speakers whether they also speak mandarin or not will write in standard written chinese a literate chinese typically can read such communication without much difficulty however colloquially spoken cantonese features different grammar and vocabulary which if written down can be largely unreadable by an untrained non cantonese speaker standard written chinese essentially functions as a different register for cantonese speakers who don t speak mandarin because they do not write in the way they usually speak in hong kong standard written chinese spoken aloud using cantonese pronunciation usually with some colloquial words substituted in serves as an acrolect used in newscasts and other formal contexts written colloquial cantonese does exist however and cantonese is unique among non mandarin regional languages in having a widely used written colloquial standard this is due in part to the fact that hong kong a large cantonese speaking territory was outside of chinese control for over a hundred years before the british returned it to the people s republic of china in 1997 in contrast the other regional languages do not have such widely used alternative written standards written colloquial cantonese has become quite popular in certain tabloids online chat rooms and instant messaging even so cantonese speakers will use standard written chinese in most formal written communications as with other aspects of the chinese language the contrast between different written standards is not sharp and there can be a socially accepted continuum between the written standards for example in writing an informal love letter one may use informal báihuà in writing a newspaper article the language used is different and begins to include aspects of wényán in writing a ceremonial document one would use even more wényán the language used in the ceremonial document may be completely different from that of the love letter but there is a socially accepted continuum existing between the two pure wényán however is rarely used in modern times note the concept of language independence for written chinese was sharply criticized by john defrancis in his book the chinese language fact and fantasy he claims that the standard written chinese is strongly tied to the mandarin spoken language chinese characters 1 main articles chinese character punctuation east asian punctuation the chinese written language employs the hàn characters pinyin hànzì which are named after the hàn culture to which they are largely attributed many chinese characters appear to have originated as depicting concrete objects the first examples we have of chinese characters are sh ng dynasty inscriptions on oracle bones which are animal bones used in osteomancy divination using bones the materials used were with very few exceptions the scapulas of oxen leading to the term scapulimancy and turtle plastrons lower shells thus the term plastromancy from these shells and bones is derived the modern chinese term for the earliest chinese writing ji g wén lit shell bone script see oracle bone script over the course of the zh u and hàn dynasties the characters became more and more stylized abstract symbols such as those indicating up and down combined characters and phonetic loans were already fully developed in even the earliest known oracle bones for example rén meaning person originated from a pictogram xiàngxíngzì lit like shape words of a man the concepts trust trustworthiness etc are represented by a combination of man and speech word and the pictogram of a hand with the arm bent at the elbow thus representing zh u elbow had already been borrowed for ji nine which had the same or similar pronunciation also additional components were added so that many characters contain one element that gives or at least once gave a fairly good indication of the pronunciation the phonetic component and another component the semantic component gives an indication of the general meaning of the character such xíngsh ngzì lit shape sound words are termed picto phonetic phono semantic phonetic compounds etc in the modern chinese languages the majority of characters are thusly phono semantically based rather than logographically based an example would be the character for the word àn that means to press down it contains n peace which serves as its phonetic component and sh u hand that indicates that the action is frequently one that is done using one s hand a number of chinese characters are derived out of each other as a result some classical dictionaries contain circular references of words having identical radicals and meanings however new meanings have been injected into these redundant words through popular usage some words were also borrowed ie additional meanings were attributed thereto because they bore phonetic resemblance with a concept that had no assigned written character many styles of chinese calligraphic writing developed over the centuries such as seal script seal script cursive script clerical script and regular script aka k ish or standard script in japan and korea hàn characters were adopted and integrated into their languages and became kanji and hanja respectively the names being japanised and koreanised pronunciations of japan still uses kanji as an integral part of its writing system while korea s use of hanja has diminished considerably it was abolished in north korea in the 1950s but revived in the 1960s as cultural continuation proved inadequate without chinese characters south korea has entirely deprecated hanja use outside of obscure academic medical or other jargon in the field of software and communications internationalization cjk is a collective term for chinese japanese and korean and the rarer cjkv for the same plus vietnamese all of which are double byte languages as they have more than 256 characters in their alphabet the computerized processing of chinese characters involves some special issues both in input and character encoding schemes as the standard 100 key keyboards of today s computers do not allow input of that many characters with a single key press the chinese writing system is mostly logographic i e each character expresses a monosyllabic word part also known as a morpheme this is helped by the fact that over 90 of chinese morphemes are monosyllabic the majority of modern words however are multisyllable and multigraphic multisyllabic words have a separate logogram for each syllable most han chinese characters have forms that were based on their pronunciation plus meaning combined rather than their meanings alone and they do not directly express ideas character forms there are currently two standards for printed chinese characters one is the traditional chinese characters fánt zì used in taiwan hong kong and macau mainland china and singapore use the simplified chinese characters ji nt zì developed by the prc government in the 1950s and finalised in the 1964 list many simplified versions were derived from historically established albeit sometimes obscure simplifications mostly calligraphic simplifications through cursive script others through the replacement of a complex part of a character with a phonetically similar glyph in taiwan some simplifications are used when characters are handwritten for the sake of speed and convenience but in printing traditional characters are the norm in addition most chinese use some personal simplifications the simplification process is actually not restricted to the simplified system in order to computerize chinese the authorities in taiwan have tried to standardize the glyphs of characters being used in order to eliminate unnecessary variations as a result several characters are combined into one and some characters have their written form altered to ease the glyph generation process by computing technologies at that time however these simplification processes are rather minor as compared to those done by the mainland government writing direction due to their unique block square nature and the morphologically inactive nature of the language chinese characters are generally written without spaces at word boundaries and can be written either horizontally or vertically and from right to left or left to right or from top to bottom or bottom to top traditionally writing was done vertically going from top to bottom and arranged in columns going from right to left on signboards etc which were horizontal the columns were reduced to a character each effectively resulting in horizontal right to left writing even in the 1950s and 1960s television subtitles still ran from right to left after the modernisation efforts of the prc government in those same decades took a stronger hold there however horizontal left to right writing à la latin has become usual practice in taiwan and hong kong a parallel process developed with increased exposure to the west especially the united states and especially with the advent of technology singapore for its part has been dually influenced by both its tradition of adopting prc guidelines with regard to chinese writing and by its predominantly anglophone society despite the rise of horizontal writing which facilitates inclusion of hindu arabic numerals and roman lettered acronyms inter alia vertical right to left writing has persisted in taiwan and hong kong especially in literature due to the absence of government official policy on adopting horizontal writing chinese characters 2 the chinese written language employs chinese characters pinyin hànzì which are logograms each symbol represents a sememe or morpheme a meaningful unit of language as well as one syllable the written language can thus be termed a morphemo syllabic script they are not just pictographs pictures of their meanings but are highly stylized and carry much abstract meaning only some characters are derived from pictographs in 100 ad the famed scholar x shèn in the hàn dynasty classified characters into 6 categories only 4 as pictographs and 82 as phonetic complexes consisting of a semantic element that indicates meaning and a phonetic element that arguably once indicated the pronunciation all modern characters are or are based on the standard script k ish see styles below there are currently two standards for chinese characters one is the traditional system still used in hong kong taiwan and macau the other is the simplified system first introduced by the government of the people s republic of china in the 1950s and finalized in 1986 the simplified system requires fewer strokes to write certain components and has fewer synonymous characters singapore which has a large chinese community is the first and only foreign country to recognize and officially adopt the simplified characters various written styles are used in chinese calligraphy including seal script zhuànsh cursive script c osh clerical script lìsh and standard script k ish aka regular script calligraphers can write in traditional and simplified characters but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art as with latin script a wide variety of typefaces exist for printed chinese characters a great number of which are often based on the styles of single calligraphers or schools of calligraphy there is no concrete record of the origin of chinese characters legend suggests that c ng jié a bureaucrat of the legendary emperor huángdì of china about 2600 bc invented chinese characters a few symbols exist on pottery shards from the neolithic period in china but whether or not they constitute writing or are ancestral to the chinese writing system is a topic of much controversy among scholars see also proto writing archaeological evidence mainly the oracle bones found in the 19 20th centuries at present only dates chinese characters to the sh ng dynasty specifically to the 14th to 11th centuries bc although this fully mature script implies an earlier period of development the vast majority of oracle bone inscriptions were found in the ruins of y n of the late sh ng dynasty although a few zh u dynasty related ones were also found the forms of the characters in the inscriptions changed slightly over the 200 to 300 years and scholars date the inscriptions of the sh ng to the ruler by the content particularly from the name of the diviners who inscribed the shell or bone artifacts contemporaneous with the late sh ng and the western zh u periods are a number of bronze inscriptions over the last century a great many ancient bronze artifacts have been unearthed in china which contain dedicational texts of the zh u aristocrats where the characters show similarities and innovations compared to the oracle bone inscriptions in the period between the oracle bones and the bamboo books of the warring states period inscriptions on bronzes are the most important record of the written script note however that since this spans such a broad period of time it is hardly meaningful to speak of bronzeware script or bronze script as a single entity romanization romanization is the process of transcribing a language in the latin alphabet there are many systems of romanization for the chinese languages this is due to the complex history of interaction between china and the west and to the chinese languages lack of phonetic transcription until modern times chinese is first known to have been written in latin characters by western christian missionaries of the 16th century but may have been written down by western travelers or missionaries of earlier periods at present the most common romanization system for standard mandarin is hanyu pinyin also known simply as pinyin pinyin is the official mandarin romanization system for the people s republic of china and the official one used in singapore see also chinese language romanisation in singapore it was adopted by the international standards organization in 1979 shortly after the united nations and the normalization of relations between the us and the prc pinyin is now commonly used when teaching mandarin in schools and universities of north america and europe it is also the system which the library of congress and american library association now use for chinese materials perhaps the second most common system of romanization for mandarin is wade giles this system was probably the most common system of romanization for mandarin before hanyu pinyin was developed wade giles is often found in academic use in the u s and until recently was widely used in taiwan taipei city now officially uses hanyu pinyin and the rest of the island officially uses t ngyòng pinyin here are a few examples of hanyu pinyin and wade giles for comparison regardless of system tone transcription is often left out either due to difficulties of typesetting or propriety for audience wade giles extensive use of easily forgotten apostrophes adds to the confusion thus most western readers will be much more familiar with beijing than they will be with b ij ng and with taipei than with t ai² pei³ regardless of romanization the words are pronounced the same learning a system of romanization requires occasional deviations from the learner s own language so for example hanyu pinyin uses q for very different values than an english speaker would probably be used to the sound represented is similar to the english ch but pronounced further forward an aspirated alveolo palatal fricative t this is a cause of confusion but is unavoidable as mandarin and any language transcribed will have phonemes different from those of the learner s own on the other hand this can be beneficial since learners can immediately be made aware of the fact that they will have to learn a new pronunciation with languages that use similar orthography the temptation to pronounce words just as in one s mother tongue can lead to great misunderstanding there are many other systems of romanization for mandarin as well as systems for cantonese minnan hakka and other chinese languages see the article category other transcriptions chinese languages have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries the phagspa script for example has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciation of pre modern forms of chinese zhuyin also known as bopomofo is still widely used in taiwan s elementary schools a comparison table of zhuyin to pinyin exists in the zhuyin article syllables based on pinyin and zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles pinyin table zhuyin table there are also at least two systems of cyrillization for chinese the most widespread is the palladius system since the dungan language is usually considered a dialect of mandarin chinese the dungan alphabet can also be considered a cyrillization of one dialect of

what is now all of sullivan county but was still a part of ulster county during the early and middle 1700 s the construction of forts all along the old mine road route 209 was necessary to protect the settlers from hostile indians there were three forts built in mamakating fort westbrookville was built in 1750 on what is now the sullivan and orange county border and until several years ago it was a restaurant in 1757 a fort was built north of the village of wurtsboro and it was called fort devans a building was later added to make it larger and it is now the home of the barone family the owners

 id=1981146 title southern partisan nonfiltered 1251 processed 1240 dbindex 451266 southern partisan is a political magazine published in the united states founded in 1979 that focuses on its southern region and those states that were formerly members of the confederate states of america its first editor was thomas fleming since 1999 it has been edited by christopher sullivan the magazine generally espouses political paleoconservatism and a pro southern perspective on political issues and the american civil war the magazine features commentary on southern culture history literature the southern agrarians the civil war and confederacy and current political issues it carries a news section entitled csa today covering stories from each of the 13 former confederate states the magazine is harshly critical of political correctness and highlights news events involving what it describes as politically correct policy making such as the removal of confederate historical monuments it also gives out a scalawag award in each issue to politicians who support politically correct actions book reviews of current texts pertaining to all aspects of the southern united states appear in each issue as do general political opinion pieces from conservative and libertarian perspectives the magazine carries columns by syndicated opinion commentators including walter williams william murchison joseph sobran and charley reese it is currently published on a bimonthly basis although the magazine is frequently found in the historical racks in mainstream bookstores it would be more fitting to find it in the current events section its emphasis is also cultural and political its statement of purpose stated at the top of its masthead in every issue is taken from a letter written by donald davidson poet to allen tate in may 1927 if there were a southern magazine intelligently conducted and aimed specifically under the doctrine of provincialism at renewing a certain sort of sectional consciousness and drawing separate groups of southern thought together something might be done to save the south critics and commentary due to its conservative political leaning and advocacy of the southern side in the american civil war southern partisan has been the subject of controversy the new york times described southern partisan as one of the southern region s most right wing magazines notes its disapproval of abraham lincoln and the union during the civil war and tendency to venerate the rebel soldiers who fought to secede from the united states according to the times it is also socially conservative as evidenced by a 1999 editorial denouncing the miami herald s coverage of gay issues though critical of these beliefs the times nevertheless notes that many of southern partisan s articles however are more high minded historical reviews in the tradition of the southern agrarian movement which glorified the south s slow paced traditions of farms and small towns new york times 2 8 2000 several sources on the political left have openly accused the magazine of racism ed sebesta an anti neo confederate fringe partisan based in dallas texas commonly attacks the magazine

1890 d in peshawar nwfp pakistan 20 january 1988 was a pashtun afghan political and spiritual leader known for his non violent opposition to british rule during the final years of the imperial rule in the indian sub continent he was a lifelong pacifist and a devout muslim he was known as badshah khan sometimes written as bacha khan the king of chiefs and frontier gandhi early years ghaffar khan was born into a generally peaceful and prosperous family in the peshawar valley his father behram khan was a land owner farmer and the chief of the mohammedzais sons of mohamed tribe of the pashtun pathan people ghaffar was the second son of behram to attend the british run edward s mission school an unusual arrangement since it was discouraged by the local mullahs at school the young ghaffar did well in his studies and was inspired by his mentor reverend wigram to see the importance of education in service to the community in his 10th and final year of high school he was offered a highly prestigious commission in the guides an elite corp of pashtun and sikh soldiers of the british raj ghaffar refused the commission after realizing even guide officers were still second class citizens in their own country he resumed his intention of university study and reverend wigram offered him the opportunity to follow his brother khan sahib to study in london while he eventually received the permission of his father ghaffar s mother wasn t willing to lose another son to london and their own culture and religion as the mullahs warned her so ghaffar began working on his father s lands while attempting to discern what more he might do with his life badshah khan in response to his inability to continue his own education ghaffar khan turned to helping others start theirs like many such regions of the world the strategic importance of the newly formed north west frontier province nwfp as a buffer for the british raj from russian influence was of little benefit to its residents the oppression of the british the repression of the mullahs and an ancient culture of violence and vendetta prompted ghaffar to want to serve and uplift his fellow men and women by means of education at 20 years of age ghaffar opened his first school in utmanzai it was an instant success and he was soon invited into a larger circle of progressively minded reformers while he faced much opposition and

and 1918 he visited every one of the 500 settled districts of the frontier it was in this frenzied activity that he had come to be known as the badshah khan king of chiefs khudai khidmatgar in time ghaffar khan s goal came to be the formulation of a united independent secular india to achieve this end he founded the khudai khidmatgar servants of god commonly known as the red shirts surkh posh during the 1920s the khudai khidmatgar was founded on a belief in the power of gandhi s notion of satyagraha a form of active non violence as captured in an oath he told its members i am going to give you such a weapon that the police and the army will not be able to stand against it it is the weapon of the prophet but you are not aware of it that weapon is patience and righteousness no power on earth can stand against it the organization recruited over 100 000 members and became legendary in opposing and dying at the hands of the british controlled police and army through strikes political organisation and non violent opposition the khudai khidmatgar were able to achieve some success and came to dominate the politics of the nwfp his brother dr khan abdul jabbar khan known as dr khan

deep admiration towards each other and worked together closely till 1947 the khudai khidmatgar agitated and worked cohesively with the indian national congress the leading national organization fighting for freedom of which ghaffar khan was a senior and respected member on several occasions when the congress seemed to disagree with gandhi on policy ghaffar khan remained his staunchest ally in 1931 the congress offered him the presidency of the party but he refused saying i am a simple soldier and khudai khidmatgar and i only want to serve but he remained a member of the congress working committee for a long time resigning only in 1939 because of his differences with the party s war policy he rejoined the congress party when the war policy was revised ghaffar khan was a champion of women s rights and nonviolence he became a hero in a society dominated by violence notwithstanding his liberal views his unswerving faith and obvious bravery led to immense respect throughout his life he never lost faith in his non violent methods or in the compatibility of islam and nonviolence he viewed his struggle as a jihad with only the enemy holding swords he was closely identified with gandhi and he is known in india as the frontier gandhi o pathans your house has fallen into ruin arise and rebuild it and remember to what race you belong ghaffar khan the partition ghaffar khan

compromises to prevent the partion like the cabinet mission plan and gandhi s suggestion to offer the prime ministership to jinnah as a result bacha khan and his followers felt a sense of betrayal by both pakistan and india bacha khan s last words to gandhi and his erstwhile allies in the congress party were you have thrown us to the wolves when given a choice between pakistan and india most voters chose pakistan by a margin of 9 to 1 in 1947 a loya jirga in the tribal areas garnered a similar result as most preferred to become part of pakistan khan asked his supporters to boycott the polls only 7 came to vote while the rest 93 of nwfp population boycotted the elections in february 1948 khan took the oath of allegiance to the new nation of pakistan shortly afterwards he addressed the pakistan constituent assembly and announced his support for pakistan while at the same time his khudai khidmatgar movement pledged allegiance to pakistan and severed all links to the congress party in his speech to the assembly he said whenever i had an opportunity to address the people in different parts of our province i told them clearly that indeed i was of the opinion that india should not be divided because today in india we have witnessed the result thousands and thousands of young and old children men and women were massacred and ruined but now that the division is an accomplished fact the dispute is over i delivered many speeches against the division of india but the question is has anybody listened to me you may hold any opinion about me but i am not a man of destruction but of construction if you study my life you will find that i devoted it to the welfare of our country we have proclaimed that if the government of pakistan would work for our people and our country the khudai khidmatgars would be with them i repeat that i am not for the destruction of pakistan in destruction lies no good neither hindus nor muslims nor the frontier not punjab bengal or sindh stands to gain from it there is advantage only in construction i want to tell you categorically i will not support anybody in destruction if any constructive programme is before you if you

he went on to say six years ago i announced on the floor of this house that pakistan is our country and its solidarity and protection is our duty and that any program that will be submitted by any party for its progress and its reconstruction shall have my fullest cooperation i repeat those words of mind even today but still there are some persons who suspect my loyalty i therefore think that it would be advisable to set up a tribunal to enquire not only into the question of loyalty or treason but also into the general massacre arson and loot and the dishonouring of women and children and old men at charsadda and the oppressive treatment meted out to us in jail badshah khan budget session of assembly on march 20 1954 despite his vitriol he confounded his opponents and indian supporters

 id=261635 title inline speed skating nonfiltered 1294 processed 1282 dbindex 451309 inline speed skating is the sport of racing on inline skates it is often called inline racing by participants although it primarily evolved from racing on quad roller skates the sport is similar enough to ice speed skating that many competitors are now known to switch between inline and ice speed skating according to the season the skate videos of skating http www youtube com watch v echuk5p4xde http www youtube com watch v rbhdwmgh rc http youtube com watch v c1fvun6qo0q an inline speed skate is a specialized version of the inline skate the boot or shoe is close fitting without much padding and usually made of leather and or carbon composites for best performance the boot must conform closely to the shape of the foot so most inline speed skating boots are heat moldable which allows the user to re shape the boots to some extent when heat is applied the frame sometimes called the chassis or plate which holds the wheels is made of aircraft quality aluminum and sometimes magnesium and usually mounts four to five polyurethane wheels of between 78 mm and 110 mm diameter each wheel contains 2 precision bearings with an aluminum spacer bearing sizes have been standardized around the 608 series though some manufacturers have tried 688 series or smaller in hopes of reducing weight these smaller bearings have been met with limited success due to frame design issues and the need for proprietary design wheels bearing precisions run from abec 1 to abec 9 while the abec system characterizes most bearings some quality bearings do not have an abec rating rather they may simply be described as swiss bearings additionally bearings with ceramic balls have been marketed since the late 1990s these presumably do not have the potential corrosion problems of metal ball bearings but they come at a significantly higher purchase price ceramic bearings are also considered more fragile and less durable than metal bearings wheels made for inline speed skating tend to have a higher durometer so they are harder than recreational wheels but less hard than aggressive wheels the higher durometer contributes to less wear and greater speed but also less resistance a factor that can increase a skater s endurance different wheels types are designed for particular skating conditions such as indoor or outdoor road or track wet or dry and rough or smooth surfaces preferable conditions dry indoor smooth lend themselves to harder wheels and higher speeds although clap skate frames similar to those used in long track ice speed skating have been designed for inline racing they have so far not proven to be superior to the normal fixed frame that inline racers use in the past most speed skaters used either four or five 80 mm wheels beginning in about 2002 elite inline speed skaters began employing fixed frame big wheel skates which have recently become the standard these frames hold four or five wheels that may be from 84 mm to 110 mm in diameter a somewhat different form of inline speed skate uses a monocoque design the boot and frame are made as one piece of carbon fiber material and offer noticeable savings in weight they are however not widely used because they cost about four to five times the price of a high quality standard boot frame combination and require custom casting of the skater s feet which is a costly and laborious process technique and control mechanically strokes in speed skating are deeper and faster to a sharper angle closer to the point of losing traction than recreational skating but not as deep and faster than ice speed skating this is because of the greater frictional forces in the direction of travel and lesser ability to apply friction without slipping of wheels on a hard surface compared to a steel blade on ice speedskaters may also move each foot across the centerline of travel leading to the double push method popularized by the united states skater chad hedrick the technique literally allows for two pushes in each stroke of the skate however it can also be tiring and even pro elite skaters will often save it until needed such as the latter stages or final sprint of a distance race the double push is usually only used for outdoor racing turning is significantly more difficult with inline speed skates than recreational skates because of more and larger wheels creating a longer wheelbase the wheel profile that is the cross section is parabolic with a sharper shape than recreational or aggressive wheels allowing the skater to essentially skate on a smaller and hence more agile wheel when leaned over in a turn brakes are not generally used on speed skates so various other techniques to slow down are used such as slaloming skating s curves or v plowing where the heels are pushed outward and the toes inward it is not readily obvious to an observer from a skater s stance that the skater is v plowing if it were the skater would quickly crash the v plow is often the stop used in situations where there is little lateral and forward room to stop one technique is the t stop essentially dragging one foot perpendicular to and behind the other however this wears the wheels of that skate quickly another stop involves picking up one foot and setting it down quickly and repeatedly somewhat perpendicular to the forward motion while keeping weight on the other foot hockey stops are possible on speed skates but require a very deep lean in order to cause the wheels to lose traction and slide also the fact that wheels are sliding means that the wheels are also wearing down very quickly grass runouts are always a last option given an adjacent grassy area generally a bicycle needs a longer stopping distance than a car and has less options in an emergency situation thus the cyclist must plan further ahead and look further ahead an inline speedskater takes much longer to stop than even a cyclist and often has still fewer options in an emergency often taking several hundred feet on a level surface to come to a stop at a full controlled deceleration thus a skater should be familiar with and proficient in stopping techniques before attempting difficult situations such as heavily travelled roads or hills an excellent book on inline racing technique and training is speed on skates by barry publow isbn 0 88011 721 4 although dated because it was published in 1999 prior to significant changes in skate designs the book nevertheless remains a valuable resource and is the only inline racing text widely available in north america race venues and formats inline speed skating races are held in a variety of formats and on a variety of surfaces indoor races are most common in the united states which has a long tradition of racing on skates at rinks the competitions are generally held at roller skating rinks with plastic coated wood floors and less commonly a plastic coated cement floor the track is about 100 m in circumference at usars events tracks are marked by four pylons set in a rectangular shape while at nira events tracks are marked by multiple pylons that create an oval shaped track events or meets are typically structured so that members of numerous age groups race in three or four distances for the more populous divisions there may be a number of heats in order to qualify for the final race to some extent indoor inline races are similar to short track speed skating outdoor races may be held on regular pavement on city streets or park roads or they may be held at specialized venues similar to velodromes sometimes called patinodromes a patinodrome is generally about 400 m in circumference and may be surfaced with asphalt concrete or similar material the curves may be banked such specialized skating tracks are relatively common in europe but rare in the united states race formats include time trials held against the clock each skater races individually or in pairs over a distance of 100 m to 300 m attempting to establish the best time time trials are occasionally held over longer distances but they are very physically demanding and not popular sprints skating in small groups of about a half dozen over a distance of 500 m to 1500 m skaters advance in a series of heats to a final round elimination races in these moderate distance races also known as last man out the hindmost skater is eliminated from the competition each time the pack of skaters complete a lap or when they complete certain specified lap numbers at one or two laps to before the finish the group has usually been pared down to four or five skaters at this point the first across the finish line is the winner points races in these moderate distance races the first second and third skaters to cross the start finish line at certain specified laps are awarded points laps late in the race are worth more points with the final lap worth the most points of all it is possible to win a points race without actually being the first to cross the finish line at the end points elimination races a combination of elimination races and points races relays relay events include teams of two to four skaters each indoor meets may include mixed relay events in which teams have either one girl and one boy or two girls and two boys but outdoor relays usually held on tracks are usually if not always single sex events in a mix relay it is traditional that a female goes to the starting line as the first skater to race criterium races instead of racing a specified distance or number laps the skaters skate for a certain amount of time then plus a small number of laps the time is typically between 15 and 45 minutes after which a bell is rung and the skaters informed the race is over when they skate one or two more laps around the course the portion of the race skated after the bell is rung is known as the bell lap or laps distance races although events such as points elimination races and criteriums may cover a distance of 10 to 25 km a distance race usually refers to a race over a set distance of about 5 km or longer and without specialized points or elimination rules the event may be truly point to point or may held on a repeating course with a circumference of at least 1 km distance races are often marketed to the general populace and not just to members of inline racing clubs in the early days of inline racing sponsors of distance races were often also running event organizers and the races they organized were commonly the same distances as those of running races about 5 10 km by the mid 1990s such events were proving to not be very popular and in the united states where sales of inline skates were also beginning to slip there was a decline in participation at races however at about that time in europe where inline skate sales were beginning to rise race sponsors began to regularly organize longer events particularly inline marathons such events proved to be enormously popular among fitness skaters with some events such as the berlin inline marathon and the engadin inline marathon in st moritz switzerland regularly attracting over 5000 skaters each year in about 2000 american event sponsors followed suit and inline half marathons and marathons were scheduled more and more frequently around the country as in europe the events proved a big draw with fitness skaters looking for events which would give their training a focus however by 2005 this surge was tempered as some major events were either postponed for a year or cancelled permanently in the united states the most popular inline marathon has continued to be the northshore inline marathon in duluth minnesota dryland triathlons occasionally organized by triathlon sponsors these events substitute inline skating for the swimming component of the race these event were infrequent even during the mid 1990s boom in inline skating participation today they are rare to non existent downhill races an event most popular in the alpine countries of europe these races are timed events down a steep course racers usually skate alone and the event commonly uses the best time of two heats to establish the winner downhill inline racers usually wear skates much more like regular inline skates than inline speed skates along with extensive body covering and protective gear and strong helmets they may reach speeds of up to 75 km h tactics tactics in outdoor inline racing are similar to those of marathon ice speed skating and of road bicycle racing skaters tend to form packs or pacelines in which skaters line up behind a lead skater thereby saving energy by skating in his draft sportsmanship requires that skaters in the paceline share the duty as paceline leader those who never take a pull at the front will likely find other skaters tacitly working together to defeat them during the course of a race skaters may make attacks speeding up the pace in an effort to weed out the weaker and slower competition these attacks may include breakaways and fliers in which skaters try to create new smaller and faster packs or else to escape entirely from the other skaters depending on the length of the race and the skills and the cooperative effort of the chasers these breakaways may or may not prove successful if a skater escapes a pack in order to join a successful breakaway group it is known as bridging up when skaters who are member of teams participate in a race together they often have pre determined roles one or two would be designated attackers whose role it is to tire out the competition another skater may be the designated winner for the team and he may avoid chasing any breakaways until late in a race possibly until the final sprint if the lead pack has never broken up professional teams usually also include skaters whose role is to slow down the chase group when it looks like a team member is on a potentially successful breakaway olympic status as of 2006 inline speed skating is not an olympic sport and prospects that it will gain such status are dim attempts by the world governing body for roller sports the international roller sports federation firs to gain olympic status for any of its disciplines were distinctly insufficient in the closing decades of the 20th century most notably it failed to capitalize when rink hockey a form of roller hockey appeared as a demonstration sport at the 1992 summer olympics in barcelona efforts by firs to obtain olympic status became more coherent in about 2000 with inline speed skating promoted as the roller sport best suited for the olympics however the federation faces competition from approximately 20 other sports also seeking entry into the olympics while at the same time the president of the international olympic committee has expressed a desire to reduce the size of the summer olympic games because inline racing does not have olympic status a number of inline speed skaters have switched to ice speed skating in order to have a chance at attending the olympics the first of these was kc boutiette who made the switch in late 1993 and skated at the 1994 winter olympics in lillehammer this migration to ice proved successful in 2002 when three former inline speed skaters from the united states won five medals in long track speed skating at the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city they were derek parra jennifer rodriguez and joey cheek in late 2002 american inline champion chad hedrick similarly switched to ice and in february 2004 he won the world allround speed skating championships he was the first american to win that event since eric flaim in 1988 in 2006 hedrick and cheek also won one gold medal each at the
