 id=10929 title fighter aircraft nonfiltered 5 processed 5 dbindex 1560004 a fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for attacking other aircraft as opposed to a bomber which is designed to attack ground targets primarily by dropping bombs fighters are comparatively small fast and maneuverable they were developed in response to the fledgling use of aircraft and dirigibles in world war i for reconnaissance and ground attack roles these early fighters were mostly wooden biplanes with light machine guns as aerial warfare became increasingly important so did control of the airspace by world war ii fighters were predominantly metal monoplanes with wing mounted cannon following the war turbojets replaced piston engines as the means of propulsion and missiles augmented or replaced guns for historical purposes jet fighters are classified by generation the generation terminology was initiated by russian defense parlance in referring to the f 35 lightning ii as a fifth generation plane years are not exact and intended as a guideline modern jet fighters are predominantly powered by one or two turbofan engines armed primarily with missiles from as few as two on some lightweight day fighters to as many as eight to ten on air superiority fighters like the su 27 flanker or f 15 eagle with a cannon as backup armament typically between 20 and 30mm in calibre and equipped with a radar as the primary method of target acquisition fighter aircraft are the primary means by which armed forces gain air superiority at least since world war ii air superiority has a crucial component of victory in most modern warfare particularly conventional warfare between regular armies and their acquisition and maintenance represent a very substantial proportion of military budgets in militaries that maintain modern fighter forces prop powered fighters world war i combat between aircraft has its origins in encounters between opposing scout aircraft early in world war i since early scout aircraft were unarmed early encounters between opposing scouts were peaceful pilots would often wave to one another as they passed by crafty pilots attempted to bring down their counterparts in a manner of amateur ways including grappling hooks small arms and grenades as militaries realized the importance of aerial reconnaissance by aircraft and dirigibles they also realized the importance of arming aircraft to destroy enemy scouts one early solution was to mount a swiveling machine gun for the backseater or a forward facing machine gun on the top wing to clear the propeller in the case of the vickers f b 5 gunbus of 1915 the propellor was behind the cockpit and the machine gun had a unobstructed forward arc there was no easy solution for the single seater aircraft a top wing mounted machine gun being difficult to aim and reload the central obstacle was firing a machine gun through the arc of the propeller without hitting the blades french aviator roland garros s solution was to fit deflector plates to his propellers where the machinegun would strike this was an imperfect solution as the plates could not withstand repeated fire a copy eventually ended up in german hands after a prototype crashed in german territory inspired by this anthony fokker s team invented the more reliable interrupter gear which enabled the widespread design of single seat fighters notable aircraft with year of introduction vickers f b 5 1915 one of the first purpose built fighter aircraft nieuport rumpler taube fokker fokker eindecker 1915 fokker dr i

coming from the change from wood cloth skinned biplanes to metal monocoque or semi monocoque monoplanes nations dabbled with twin engined fighters as heavy fighters but the idea did not take hold except for some specialized applications requiring a heavier payload the primary driver of fighter innovation were not military budgets but civilian aircraft races aircraft designed for these races sported innovations like streamlining and liquid cooled engines that would find their way into the fighters of world war ii notable aircraft biplanes avia b 534 bristol bulldog fiat cr 42 considered the best biplane fighter and widely used in north africa gloster gladiator operated in the mediterranean during world war ii hawker fury served in spanish civil war monoplanes boeing p 26 peashooter f2a brewster buffalo polikarpov i 16 pzl p 11 world war ii aerial combat formed an important part of world war ii military doctrine the ability of aircraft to locate harass and interdict ground forces was an instrumental part of the german combined arms doctrine and their inability to seize air superiority over britain rendered an invasion infeasible erwin rommel noted the effect of airpower anyone who has to fight even with the most modern weapons against an enemy in complete command of the air fights like a savage against modern european troops under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success fighter aircraft of the second world war introduced rockets as well as innovations of the 1930s including first jet engine powered designs piston engined fighters continued to be refined and developed with increasing performance and capabilities up until the advent of jet aircraft such as the messerschmitt me 262 and gloster meteor many of these fighters would do over 400 mph 600 km h in level flight and were fast enough in a dive that they started encountering the transonic buffeting experienced near the speed of sound occasionally breaking up in flight due to the heavy load placed on an aircraft near the so called sound barrier dive brakes were developed late in world war ii to minimize these problems and restore control to the pilots radar invented shortly prior to world war ii was fitted to some fighters such as the messerschmitt bf 110 f6f hellcat and northrop p 61 black widow to enable them to locate targets at night another innovation of this period was the strike fighter short on bombers marines in the pacific theater bolted bomb racks on to their f4 corsairs this proved a versatile concept as the fighters were able to fight enemy fighters once they had relieved themselves of their bombload the f6f hellcat was also used in similar fashion in late 1944 and 1945 notable aircraft france bloch mb 150 dewoitine d 520 morane saulnier m s 406 germany

propulsion providing greatly increased speed the efficiency of piston driven propellers drops off considerably at transsonic speeds many of these early jets resembled their piston driven counterparts in several ways many were straight winged aircraft armed primarily with cannon radar was not yet in common usage except on specialized night fighters the first jets were developed during world war ii and saw combat in its last year messerschmitt developed the first operational jet fighter the me 262 it was considerably faster than piston driven aircraft and in the hands of a competent pilot was practically untouchable due to german fuel shortages however it saw little use nevertheless the plane indicated the obsolescence of piston driven aircraft spurred by reports of the german jets britain s gloster meteor entered production soon after and the two entered service around the same time in 1944 by the end of the war almost all work on piston powered fighters had ended mixed propulsion designs such as the ryan fr fireball saw brief use but by the end of the 1940s virtually all new combat aircraft were jet powered despite the advantages the early jet fighters were far from perfect their operational lifespans could be measured primarily in hours the engines themselves were fragile and bulky and power could be adjusted only slowly innovations such as swept wings ejector seats and all moving tailplanes were introduced in this period notable aircraft germany heinkel he 280 the world s first jet powered fighter prototype only messerschmitt me 262 the first operational jet powered

capability of the jet fighter the introduction of guided missiles such as the aim 9 sidewinder and aim 7 sparrow moved combat to beyond visual range though it often devolved into dogfights in visual range necessitating the standardization of radar to acquire targets designers experimented with a variety of aeronautical innovations such as the swept wing delta wing variable geometry wings and area ruled fuselages with the aid of swept wing these were the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier the primary specializations of this era were the fighter bomber such as the f 105 and the sukhoi su 7 and the interceptor english electric lightning and f 104 starfighter the interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond visual range as a result interceptors were designed with a large missile payload and a powerful radar sacrificing agility in favor of speed and rate of climb notable aircraft canada

aeronautical development approached maturity and growth in combat capability grew via the introduction of improved missiles radar and other avionics most significantly as a result of combat experience with guided missiles designers conceded that combat could and would degenerate into close dogfights guns again became standard and maneuverability was once again a priority these innovations while greatly improving the capabilities of fighters the f 4 could carry a payload greater than the b 24 liberator a world war ii heavy bomber also came at a considerable increase at cost whereas militaries had previously specialized fighters for specific roles such as night fighter heavy fighter and strike fighter in order to counter the growing cost of fighters militaries began to consolidate missions

panavia tornado have versions specially suited for various roles while true multirole warplanes include the f a 18 hornet and dassault mirage 2000 this was facilitated by avionics which could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes as development costs increased economics further pushed the development for multirole aircraft unlike interceptors of the previous era most modern air

tigershark generation 4 5 1990 present this half generation has been coined to describe the current generation of fighters in service marked by a stagnation of aerodynamic technologies compared with the boom of the 3rd generation matched with a tremendous advance in avionics and other flight electronics as a result of applying the advances made in microchip and semiconductor technology in the 1980s and 90s as well as limited stealth shaping made possible with supercomputers a prime example of this generation is the f a 18e f super hornet an upgrade of the 1970s hornet design while the basic aerodynamic features remain the same the super hornet features improved avionics in the form of an all glass cockpit a solid state aesa fixed array radar new engines the structural use of

of texas at austin campus the law school has been in existence since the founding of the university in 1883 it was one of only two schools at the university when it was founded the other being the liberal arts school the school offers both juris doctor and master of laws degrees the law school is consistently ranked among the top twenty law schools in the nation according to u s news world report and has a reputation for turning out outstanding lawyers and public servants the school is ranked eighth for faculty quality in leiter s law school rankings the law school maintains a median gpa of 3 42 among the highest of all law schools it runs a supreme court clinic which as of january 2007 is preparing a case before the supreme court of the united states the law school has the dubious distinction of having its racially based admission policies struck down by courts on two separate occasions sweatt v painter the school was involved in the 1950 united states supreme court case of sweatt v painter the case involved a black man heman marion sweatt who was refused admission to the school of law on the grounds that substantially equivalent facilities meeting the requirements of plessy v ferguson were offered by a law school open only to blacks at the time the plaintiff first applied to the university of texas there was no law school in texas which admitted blacks the texas trial court instead of granting the plaintiff a writ of mandamus continued the case for six months allowing the state time to create a law school only for blacks the supreme court reversed the lower court decision saying that the separate school failed to measure up because of quantitative differences in facilities and intangible factors such as its isolation from most of the future lawyers with whom its graduates would interact the documentation of the court s decision includes the following differences in facilities between the university of texas law school and the separate law school for blacks the university of texas school of law had 16 full time and 3 part time professors 850 students and a law library of 65 000 volumes while the separate school had 5 full time professors 23 students and a library of 16 500 volumes the court held that education could be measured only in intangibles hopwood v texas in 1992 plaintiff cheryl hopwood a white american woman was denied admission to the school of law despite being better qualified than many admitted minority candidates texas monthly editor paul burka later described as the perfect plaintiff to question the fairness of reverse discrimination because of her academic credentials and the personal hardships she had endured including a young daughter suffering from a muscular disease the case of hopwood v texas was the first successful legal challenge to racial preferences in student admissions since regents of the university of california v bakke the court decided that the school may not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body to combat the perceived effects of a hostile environment at the law school to alleviate the law school s poor reputation in the minority community or to eliminate any present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school however in 2003 the supreme court ruled in grutter v bollinger a case involving the university of michigan that the united states constitution does not prohibit the law school s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body this effectively reversed the decision of hopwood v texas notable alumni james baker former secretary of state paul begala

series which was broadcast on 5 november 2006 synopsis ianto has a dark secret tied to the basement of the hub a secret he will protect at any cost plot it is an uneventful day at torchwood three and the team are playing basketball when ianto arrives they pay little attention to him and decide to go out for a drink alone in the hub ianto orders pizza just as a japanese doctor named tanizaki arrives ianto brings tanizaki into the depths of the hub and shows him a partially cyber converted woman strapped to a cyber conversion unit ianto introduces her as lisa as tanizaki a cybernetics expert examines lisa ianto explains that his girlfriend lisa worked in london at torchwood one during the cyberman invasion near the end of the battle of canary wharf the cybermen were desperate for troops so they began grafting cyber components onto bodies instead of transplanting their brains while torchwood one began to burn ianto dragged lisa out tanizaki asks how ianto knew how to hook lisa up to the correct support machines and to his surprise she wakes up and replies that she told him although she is still in pain she apparently retains her human mind the two want tanizaki to find a way to turn her human again taking her to the autopsy room tanizaki manages to get lisa breathing on her own she and ianto are elated but the rest of the team have received an alert about a ufo over cardigan bay and are returning to the hub ianto tells tanizaki to help lisa back down to the basement while he cleans up once there however lisa grabs tanizaki by the throat subduing him and speaking in a cyberman sounding voice she secures tanizaki in the cyber conversion frame and activates it above jack notices the sudden power drain and asks toshiko to check however ianto interrupts claiming that the generators had been acting up and offers to fix it himself turning down gwen s offer of help to ianto s horror he finds tanizaki s bloodied corpse on the floor with cybernetic parts clumsily grafted to his face lisa simply states that tanizaki s upgrade her way of repaying him failed ianto is upset but tries to rationalise it by telling lisa she did not mean it and that it is just some post traumatic side effect he tells her to stay in the basement and that this cannot happen again pulling himself together he hides the body while lisa returns to the frame and re energises jack tells toshiko to send a polite message to the ufo an arkan leisure cruiser to leave earth s atmosphere lisa s new power drain attracts attention and toshiko finds two life signs in the basement one is ianto s but the other is unknown jack concludes that they are under attack and starts handing out sidearms gwen and owen go to find ianto and jack warns them to shoot first if there is any doubt their main priority is to find ianto the power source is interfering with communications as gwen and owen approach the basement room toshiko goes through the internal cctv records and finds that someone has removed images from the system however she finds one that shows ianto showing tanizaki into the hub gwen and owen burst into the room guns at the ready the conversion unit is empty but owen recognises it for what it is they turn off the unit and base power automatically comes up owen reports the presence of the unit to jack who orders them back up immediately before owen can respond lisa attacks him and knocks him out next advancing on gwen jack rushes down telling toshiko to activate lockdown procedures if she does not hear from him in fifteen minutes lisa disarms gwen and places her in the unit starting it up jack is about to shoot lisa when ianto pushes him against a wall allowing lisa to escape the unit is shut down just before the knives get to gwen by shutting off the power to the whole base however they are now trapped inside ianto apologises and jack realises that he is somehow responsible for this jack turns his gun on ianto and marches him back to the hub to interrogate him carrying an unconscious owen and accompanied by gwen owen regains consciousness as jack asks ianto what else he is keeping from them and ianto retorts that all the others want from him is to clean up after them no questions asked they have never asked about his life he argues that as lisa fell in battle for torchwood they owe it to her to find a cure jack tells him there is none and explains that this is how it starts with a small decision the cybermen work by exploiting human weakness and if they do not stop her a base will be set up from which they will sweep across the universe assimilating everyone however ianto refuses to give up on lisa toshiko reports that it will take six hours to get the power back up as ianto offers to talk to lisa she appears and tells them that the base is suitable and the army will be rebuilt from here when ianto and jack point out that lisa still looks human her own appearance disgusts her she offers to transplant her brain into ianto s body so that they can be together as one asking if this would be what love is when ianto disagrees she tells him they are incompatible and throws him aside with him landing unconscious facedown in a pool of water the others run into the board room and decide that lisa must be destroyed at all costs jack hands toshiko a device that will unlock any door in 45 seconds and orders her to go up to the reception area and charge up two power rods that should give them enough power for what they need lisa reaches the board room and jack distracts her while toshiko leaves and owen and gwen go to the autopsy room to scavenge any weapons they can lisa grabs jack and electrocutes him as the others look on jack gets up but lisa deletes him again and he stays down toshiko manages to get through the main door before lisa reaches her lisa moves towards owen and gwen instead who hide together in one of the freezers jack wakes up again and revives ianto by breathing life into him with a kiss as owen and gwen start kissing passionately themselves in the freezer gwen s mobile phone goes off alerting lisa to where they are gwen and owen scramble out of the freezer when lisa moves towards gwen owen tells her not to touch gwen and stabs one of lisa s unarmoured areas with a scalpel however this only momentarily disables lisa up in the reception area toshiko finishes her rewiring down below jack holds lisa off with a blow torch and sprays the special barbecue sauce that helps their pet pterodactyl identify its food it flies down and attacks lisa who screams while the others use the now powered invisible lift to escape in roald dahl plass toshiko rejoins them ianto punches jack for leaving lisa for dead and warns him that one day he will have the chance to save jack but will watch him suffer and die instead toshiko informs them that she managed to trip the lockdown timer so power should be returning to the base hearing this ianto runs back to the front entrance the rest giving chase meanwhile the pizza delivery girl arrives and is let into the hub where she hears the pterodactyl s cries as lisa bloodied but standing appears behind her ianto grabs a gun from the reception desk and holds it on the others threatening to shoot if they follow jack disarms him and points his own revolver at ianto s head insisting that ianto s loyalty is to the team now adding that if he does not kill lisa jack will kill both of them ianto stands up to jack accusing him of being the biggest monster of all jack lets ianto go giving him ten minutes ianto finds pizza boxes and a power drain occurring going to the basement room he sees lisa dead on the floor her head bloody someone calls out his name and ianto turns to see the delivery girl with stitches around the top of her head she tells him she is lisa she took the girl s body and transplanted the brain so they could be together he sobs hugging her then pushes her away holding his gun on her she protests that she did this for him as ianto finally breaks down in tears turning away when she adds that they can both be upgraded several shots ring out in succession as the other torchwood members open fire killing her ianto falls to his knees in front of lisa s cybernetic body ianto returns to the hub the next day and looks up at jack in the board room jack simply nods and ianto nods back starting to clear up the rubbish of the others gwen watches him and muses about all the deception just because ianto could not bear to live without lisa she asks jack if he has ever loved anyone that much but he does not reply gwen adds that for a moment she believed that jack could have really died jack replies that he did as well and for just that second he felt so alive cast captain jack harkness john barrowman gwen cooper eve myles owen

of the pterodactyl it is revealed that the reptile is attracted to a sort of barbecue sauce which is what the torchwood team use to identify its food the torchwood institute website explains that it is a special protein sauce to help the creature identify what is safe for it to eat never before seen flashbacks to the events of the doctor who episode doomsday 2006 appear in this episode featuring ianto pulling lisa from the destruction of torchwood one the torchwood institute website reveals that ianto worked for torchwood one before he was transferred to torchwood three it also reveals that dr tanizaki was the head of the cybertechnology institute of osaka founded in 2007 after the cyberman invasion to monitor and learn from the cybermen and their debris the lock picking device is said to be something suzie was working with this is the first time suzie costello has been mentioned since her death in everything changes the lock picking device is the same prop as the data scanning device seen in everything changes although it is not clear if it is the same device this is the third reference to jack s immortality although this time the others witness his ability to return from the dead unlike the cybermen of the main doctor who universe the parallel earth cybermen usually transplant human brains into cyberman shells the cyber conversion of lisa by means of direct grafting of cyber components is more akin to the original cybermen s methods of conversion the torchwood institute website states that while most of the humans who were cyber converted were either pulled into the void or had their cyber components wrenched from them those whose components originated from this side of the void were left behind most of these people died then as their conditions could not be stabilised due to torchwood s unfamiliarity with the technology this clarifies an issue that was not made clear at the end of doomsday jack and ianto s kiss foreshadows a relationship between them which begins in they keep killing suzie the two kiss again on screen in end of days a similar looking partially converted cyberwoman appeared in the illustrations made for the webcast doctor who radio

graphic novels in 2002 a series of graphic novels was launched that comprised the first two books in the series left behind and tribulation force the original idea was to release sets of 3 to 5 novels for each book in the original series however after the 5th and final novel for tribulation force was released the graphic novel series was apparently discontinued and the novels that were released are now as of december 2006 said to be out of print many hope that the novels will continue as originally planned but as of the afore mentioned date no new releases have appeared nor has there been any mention about possible future releases in the official lb website and questions about the novels placed to the site are always ignored franchises fans of the series have been repeatedly disappointed by franchises that are released based on the books such as the films and the graphic novels as in each case only the first two titles are produced and the rest seem to be always ignored there are rumors that a fourth film is in the works by cloud ten pictures and fans can only hope that this film will be truly based on nicolae the third movie in the series had so many plot differences from the

carpathia rises to become secretary general of the united nations promising to restore peace and stability to all nations what most of the world does not realize is that carpathia is actually the antichrist foretold from the bible coming to grips with the truth and becoming born again christians rayford steele his daughter chloe their pastor bruce barnes and young journalist cameron buck williams begin their quest as the tribulation force to help save the lost and prepare for the coming tribulation in which god will rain down judgment on the world for seven years characters a complete list of left behind characters is listed at the bottom of this page response the books have sold very well in the united states many topping the new york times list of bestsellers nick parmley a charismatic baptist minister from portland oregon has called on evangelical christians to adopt this series as required reading in other areas such as continental europe where dispensationalism is largely non existent the books have been far less successful the popularity of this series has spilled over beyond the americas and the english speaking world it has been translated to many languages including chinese and japanese there is however a protracted lag in translation as at september 2005 the chinese version of book 11 is in the press and the japanese version of book 6 has been published criticism in an article enquiring into the series popularity salon magazine writer michelle goldberg described what she believed was one of the series attractions on one level the attraction of the left behind books isn t that much different from that of say tom clancy or stephen king the plotting is brisk and the characterizations manichean however she considered the books to be an attack on judaism and liberal secularism and pointed out that the near future end times the books are set in seem to reflect the actual worldview of millions of americans including many prominent conservative leaders in 2004 penn teller s tv show bullshit devoted an episode to the end of the world phenomenon following centuries of incorrect prophecy the show explained that bible prophecy is nothing new and that the vague descriptions in the book of revelation can apply to almost any location at any time the left behind series was featured and jerry b jenkins was interviewed jenkins stated in my mind in a way we are sales people for the gospel he continued people say money is the root of all evil and actually it s the love of money that s the root of all evil so there is nothing wrong with money if you use it right the host penn jillette responded in voiceover what s the story on money if you get it by creating an irrational fear in people the blog slacktivist typepad com is notable for analyzing these books at a rate of a few pages every week written from the perspective of a non dispensationalist evangelical christian it generally criticizes the books as poorly written based on bad biblical scholarship and for presenting an unflattering view of god christian criticisms some practicing christians evangelical and otherwise have shown concern that the social perspectives promoted in the left behind series unduly sensationalize the death and destruction of masses of people in addition some christians deny the key eschatological beliefs underpinning the plotline for instance amillennial and postmillennial christians do not believe in the same timeline of the second coming as premillennialists while preterist christians do not interpret the book of revelation to predict future events at all brian mclaren a self appointed spokesperson of the emergent church compares the left behind series to the da vinci code and states what the left behind novels do the way they twist scripture toward a certain theological and political end i think brown is twisting scripture just to other political ends but at the end of the day the difference is i don t think brown really cares that much about theology along with some other rapture fiction novels the left behind series demonstrates a different understanding of the gospel and the christian life than that taught within the historic orthodoxy of evangelical protestantism this issue is explored in rapture fiction and the evangelical crisis by crawford gribben some catholics also believe the books are anti catholic noting that the book mentions that many who thought of themselves as catholics were not raptured the book says that many who called themselves catholics but did not truly believe in jesus were not raptured but it does not mention the proportion who were while the fictional pope john xxiv was raptured he is described as having greatly differing views from the rest of the church and this is implied as the reason he was raptured his successor pope peter ii becomes pontifex maximus of enigma babylon one world faith an amalgamation of all remaining world faiths and religions other christians describe problems with prophetical teachings in the left behind series it is noted that in books 8 9 lahaye and jenkins teach that recipients of the mark of the beast can still be saved however in the mark the chang scenario is developed whereby a character receives both the mark of the beast and the sealing of the lord in desecration chang s dual marking was justified in the storyline this has led some readers to wonder how a christian can have the mark of the beast and still be saved which many readers voiced on the left behind messageboard and which was answered on the

feature length films in the 1970s and 1980s about the rapture and second coming the films popularity among christian fundamentalists have led to increased study and speculation as to the events described in the book of revelation crawford gribben has shown that there were successful rapture fiction novels as early as 1913 with some earlier works identified as dating from 1905 of the former sydney watson s scarlet and purple 1913 the mark of the beast 1915 and in the twinkling of an eye are cited as examples of the genre movies based on the series the success of the left behind books have led to the release of three motion pictures based on the series so far the movies have been produced and released by cloud ten pictures a canadian christian movie studio in 2000 the studio released left behind the movie based on the first book of the series in a very unusual marketing scheme the studio released the movie on video and dvd first and then released it to the theatres the movie fared poorly in theaters the movie starred former growing pains star kirk cameron as buck williams cameron who finds the series inspiring is a practicing evangelist and co host with ray comfort on the tv show the way of the master in 2002 the sequel left behind ii tribulation force based on the first four hundred pages of the second novel tribulation force was released the film debuted at 2 behind spider man on the home video charts and was 1 in terms of overall sales for two days on amazon com in october 2005 the second sequel left behind world at war was released first to churches on october 21 2005 for church theatrical viewings and was released to dvd and video on october 25 2005 the new movie is based very loosely on the final fifty pages of tribulation force and features louis gossett jr playing the president of the united states gerald fitzhugh the third movie was the least identifiable with events in any of the books recognizable events were the marriages of buck with chloe steele and rayford steele with amanda white the death of bruce barnes and president fitzhugh heading an attack resulting in world war iii with great britain and egypt against the global community major parts of the movie however were not in any of the books including the poisoning of bibles by global forces and an attempt by fitzhugh to assassinate nicolae carpathia buck s meeting with the president in the books makes it into the movie but in a totally different form it is of special interest to note that in 2004 cloud ten pictures made a deal with sony entertainment to release all of its pictures under the sony banner and has been doing so ever since except for clarence gilyard the entire cast of left behind and left behind ii tribulation force reprised their respective roles for left behind world at war clarence gilyard who played bruce barnes was unable to return for the third movie due to a scheduling conflict with a play in new york as of december 2006 cloud ten has announced that the fourth film in the series is now in development to release in late 2007 video game based on the series the video game left behind eternal forces was developed by a publicly traded company left behind games the game is a real time strategy game where the player controls a tribulation forces team and allows the player to use the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world the game was released in the united states on november 14 2006 and received mixed reviews distribution was initially planned to work through churches and megachurches the game has drawn criticism from some quarters notably the renowned anti violent videogame campaigner jack thompson for giving the player the choice of who to play

 id=3271 title authoritarianism nonfiltered 45 processed 43 dbindex 1560044 this article applies to political and organizational ideologies for information on the psychology of individuals who seek to dominate those within their sphere of influence see authoritarian personality authoritarianism describes a form of social control characterized by strict obedience to the authority of a state or organization often maintaining and enforcing control through the use of oppressive measures authoritarian regimes are strongly hierarchical in an authoritarian form of government citizens are subject to state authority in many aspects of their lives including many matters that other political philosophies would see as erosion of civil liberties and freedom there are various degrees of authoritarianism even very democratic and liberal states will show authoritarianism to some extent for example in areas of national security at least one author john duckitt suggests a specific link exists between authoritarianism and collectivism in both cases individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals expectations and confirmities the fundamental definition of authoritarianism is a government that has the power to author legislation without consent of those being governed in this sense even a representative democracy is authoritarian over periods of years because the public only has the authority to vote the representatives out at election time forms of authoritarian government there exists a gradation in authoritarianism as well as a variety of possible authoritarian behaviors authoritarianism may exist under different regimes absolute monarchies are almost always authoritarian for instance criticizing the royal government of france under the ancien régime could get writers etc imprisoned by executive order known as a lettre de cachet dictatorships are always authoritarian democracies rarely exhibit much authoritarian behavior except in transition to from authoritarian states or when martial law is imposed during war for example many if not most citizens of authoritarian states do not perceive their state as authoritarian until late in its development this makes it difficult to label modern states as democratic or authoritarian people make this difficulty worse when they use these terms without clear definitions despotisms are always authoritarian militarchies countries run by soldiers are almost always authoritarian note that militarchy does not necessarily mean a dictatorship or a junta but a generally thoroughly militarized state a classical example of militarchy would be ancient sparta or the mamluk egypt theocracies are almost always authoritarian an exception is the quaker consensus in consensus decision making decision making arrived at by finding a spiritual consensus rather than voting was developed by the religious society of friends quakers early in the 17th century and is in use to the present day as an example of this difficulty modern democracies once enforced laws that are now widely considered abusive and authoritarian for instance countries such as the united states and the united kingdom until recently enforced sodomy laws imposing the moral and religious values of the majority over matters of private life authoritarian regimes grant wide powers to law enforcement agencies in the extreme this leads to a police state authoritarian regimes may or may not have a rule of law in the former case laws are enacted and though they may seem intrusive unjust or excessive they are applied to common people in the latter case laws do not exist or are routinely ignored government actions follow the judgments or whims of officials authoritarianism and the economy introdution in the late 20th century political elites in east and southeast asia argued that countries with authoritarian regimes were more likely to be economically successful than democratic countries examples given to support this argument were south korea singapore malaysia and taiwan all of which were authoritarian and experiencing a period of rapid growth the belief that authoritarian governments were likely to economically out perform democracies was reconsidered in 1997 during the asian financial crisis there are of course many instances of authoritarian nations that have not encountered rapid economic growth a good historical example is spain in post war europe under francisco franco s authoritarian regime spain was considerably less economically developed than neighbouring countries such as france despite the fact that spain s infrastructure had not been devastated by the war it was not until democracy was restored following franco s death in 1975 that spain experienced an economic boom more recent examples of poor economic performance in nations with authoritarian regimes are myanmar libya and north korea despite the asian financial crisis the idea of developmental authoritarianism remains an attractive route to economic expansion in many developing nations the communist party of china which presides over the world s fastest growing economy uses this concept today as justification for its authoritarian rule the middle east in the 21st century the middle east region has the highest concentration of authoritarian nations in the world this is usually explained by reference to the region s cultural specificity for example bernard lewis islam and the west or its political economy while it is true that historically the region has experienced a despotic authoritarian tradition as exemplified by the ottoman 13th century to late 20th century and mamluk 13th century to late 19th century empires using culture to explain the region s current political situations is rather a blunt tool cultural explanations fail to allow for regional diversity are unable to account or indeed allow for progression and via their narrow focus fail to see the correlates between this region and other developing nations such as the people s republic of china which have only relatively recently become members of the global political economy a political economy approach political economists argue that the predominance of authoritarian regimes in the middle east can be explained by reference to the regions economic development internal and external factors need to be considered and the interaction between them if a coherent argument is to be made external factors include a consideration of the regional and national impact of colonialism and the point at which each of these nations joined the global economy internal factors such as indigenous social structures and pre existing modes of production also need to be explored colonialism the territorial boundaries of most middle east nations were determined by colonial powers in the inter war period following the break up of the ottoman empire roger owen argues that this is an important factor when considering the relationship between the state and its citizens clearly an imposed nationhood does not carry with it a presupposition of unity colonised nations were required to contribute to the economy of their governors stability and therefore control of the populace was an important feature of the state infrastructure in the colonial period typically some two thirds of public expenditure was security related owen 1993 p10 the historical legacy of colonialism for the citizens of middle eastern states was therefore one of imposed unity economic exploitation and a state intent on controlling rather than consulting its populace the global world economy colonial states were turned into the globes producers of raw materials they serviced and supported the capitalist economies of their colonising country dependency theory adherents therefore suggest that economic under development in the middle east is a result of entering the global economy in a subordinate position in other words exploitation rather than cultural specivity indigenous social structures and modes of production the authoritarian traditions of the middle east have changed and evolved over time as the social political and economic situation has changed political economists such as nazih ayubi argue that systems of patronage and clientelism are not the result of essential cultural traits but rather an outcome of articulated modes of production the co existing and articulated modes of production ayubi refers to are those of capitalist waged labour and those indigenous to the middle east for example artisans merchants crop sharing clientelism which ayubi describes as informal ties in which services and some goods are exchanged between people of unequal status ayubi 2001 p169 as a concept has developed to accommodate these articulated modes of production in a macro political setting the resulting political structure is authoritarian corporatism politic and economic power resides with the state which adopts the role of arbiter and mediates between a variety of social groups with no class hegemony civil society becomes subordinate to the state see also military dictatorship elective dictatorship police state

conviction of committing a crime historically the frequency of imprisonment its duration and severity have varied considerably there has also been much debate about the motives for incarceration its effectiveness and fairness as well as debate regarding the related questions about the nature and etiology of criminal behavior religious perspectives religious opinions have often shaped views towards incarceration talmud yerushalmi talmud babli and both the old and new testaments describe law as the expression of the will of god islam adopts a similar legal posture with sharia an arabic word meaning path interpreted as the infallible expression of the divine will that is applicable to all aspects of life one of the differences between monotheistic religions is the degree to which they emphasize orthopraxis vs orthodoxy i e proper conduct vs proper belief in comparison with islam judaism and christianity emphasize orthodoxy over orthopraxis islam emphasizes orthopraxis more than orthodoxy legal positivism those who favor legal positivism maintain that there is no unjust law and no unjust incarceration among the founders of the legal positivism is jean bodin who argued that burning is too lenient a punishment for severe crimes because the suffering does not last more than one hour bodin also approved of torture during the criminal interrogations including the

essence of law is the command or will the notion of an unjust law is contradictio in adjecto because law is itself the definition of justice legacy of the enlightenment around the time of the american and french revolutions social philosophers started to support the notion that a human law which violates natural law is not a true law in this view an unjust law is not a genuine law but rather an act of violence and unjust incarceration is a possibility social philosophers who opposed legal positivism include hugo grotius gottfried leibniz benedict spinoza voltaire and jean jacques rousseau john locke s criticism of hobbesian theory was a forerunner to the modern notions of civil disobedience and human rights locke argued that humans in the state of nature are free and equal and that they possess the fundamental rights to life liberty and property everyone should defend his or her rights and should surrender only such rights as are necessary for the common good this natural rights theory provided a philosophical basis for both the american and french revolutions with thomas jefferson substituting pursuit of happiness for locke s property in the trinity of inalienable rights punishment vs rehabilitation the above mentioned opinions often inform debates about the goal of incarceration should the emphasis be on punishment or rehabilitation arguments have been made on both sides of the issues and larger societal perspectives have shifted from one side to the other over the years those who favor punishment often contend that the practice serves both as revenge for the wronged and as a deterrent against further crime on the other hand those who favor rehabilitation argue that by trying to change a criminal s behavior recidivism rates can be reduced and both the criminal and society can benefit from improvement justice studies penology and justice studies emphasize description and analysis of antecedents of criminal behavior and outcomes of consequences imposed by criminal justice on the criminal behavior an example of a modern quantitative study of factors influencing the criminal behavior is the study by krus and hoehl 1994 in the study by krus and hoehl variables that might explain differences in incarceration rates among populations were located by a computer aided search of the compendium of world rankings compiled by the facts on file corporation and the world model group containing over 50 000 records on more than 200 countries they argued that predictor variables explained about 69 of variance in the international incarceration rates cited as especially important were unequal distribution of wealth the explanation perhaps favored by liberals family disintegration the explanation perhaps favored by conservatives according to krus and hoehl these variables act in concert the presence of one variable does not always precipitate crime but the presence of both variables often does precipitate crime frequency of incarceration in the united states marc mauer 1991 in his americans behind bars a comparison of international rates of incarceration was among the first who called attention to the fact that the united states has higher per capita rates of incarceration than many countries in the world sample headlines regarding mauer s observations were america the land of the imprisoned santa barbara news press february 20 1992 the world s top jailer usa today february 12 1992 and a dangerous place to live st louis post dispatch february 11 1992 on february 22 1992 boston globe reported that few statistics about the united states are more startling than the growth of the prison population during the quarter century since americans abandoned the war on poverty and the houston chronicle february 17 1992 concluded that a huge potential human resource is being wasted that is the real crime this reported extreme aberrance of the united states with respect to frequency of incarceration as compared with the other nations did not alter the prevailing opinion that favors draconian laws and strict punishments in fact arguments have been made that the higher incarceration rates of the u s might well explain the nationwide decrease in violent crime in the u s a 1992 study by the office of u s attorney general william barr asserted it strains credulity to believe that the lowered crime rates have been unrelated to the unprecedented increases in the nation s incarceration rates even if there may have been other causes as well arguments have been made to the contrary as well dr todd r clear writes the expansion of the penal system has not been accompanied by an equivalent decrease in crime the failure of this extraordinary increase in incarceration to produce a meaningful reduction in crime needs explanation the purpose of this paper is to argue that the common view of the prison is simplistic because it fails to account for the unintended consequences of imprisonment these unforeseen effects are subtle and in some ways modest but over time they combine to counteract the positive effects of prison a broader more complete understanding of the effects of incarceration would enable us to understand the limits of using prison as a crime prevention strategy also cited as a possible factor in incarceration rates in the u s is the influence of the mass media it has been argued that the media emphasis on individual criminality does not allow for opinions that society at large might shape criminality similar observations about larger society were made centuries ago thomas jefferson s favorite book by cesare beccaria s 1764 dei delitti e delle pene on crimes and punishments remains arguably one of the most thought provoking books on criminal justice beccaria documents the relationship between the brutalization of society and its support of severity of punishments and stresses that the law should not encompass more than what is necessary to maintain the public order duration of incarceration in the united states partly in response to rising crime rates the average length of incarceration in the united states steadily increased in the 1970s many legislatures continued to reduce discretion in both the sentencing process and the determination of when the conditions of a sentence have been satisfied determinate sentencing use of mandatory minimums and guidelines based sentencing continue to remove the human element from sentencing such as the prerogative of the judge to consider the mitigating or extenuating circumstances of a crime to determine the appropriate length of the incarceration as the consequence of three strikes laws the increase in the duration of incarceration in the last decade was most pronounced in the case of life prison sentences which increased by 83 between 1992 and 2003 severity of incarceration severe punishments such as beatings prolonged sleep deprivation sensory deprivation chaining have been often inflicted on prisoners there are many reasons given for justification of such punishment in the 16th century the bishop of trier binsfeld in his tractatus de confessionibus maleficorum 1596 claimed that since the sinfulness of the world increases god also allows increasing the severity of punishments a movement to abolish cruel treatment of prisoners began during the age of enlightenment and continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries however there have been continual arguments for severe punishments perhaps increasing somewhat in the early years of the 21st century contemporary justifications for such punishment often revolve around the rights of the victims often underlying these perspectives are opinions that stress the vindictive eye for the eye notions of the old testament and qur an over the notion that the primary goal of incarceration should be the reform and reeducation of prisoners to facilitate their re integration into society within the framework of penology the trend toward increasing the severity of punishments is reflected in publications such as block s 1997 p 12 advocacy of policy initiatives aimed at increasing the unpleasantness of prison life that would likely be a cost effective method of fighting crime and arpaio and sherman s 1996 book claiming that the increase in the severity of treatment of prisoners will result in decrease in recidivism arpaio and sherman proposed to increase the severity of imprisonment by the construction of tent prison camps in the mojave desert where summer temperatures reach 120 degrees fahrenheit by serving prisoners foul tasting food by humiliating prisoners by cross dressing and by reinstatement of the chain gangs mauer 1999 pp 92 93 documents some other the measures used to implement the increasing the unpleasantness of prison life policies that include shooting around prisoners to keep them moving forced consumption of milk of magnesia placing naked inmates in strip cells and handcuffing inmates for long periods of time incarceration and torture as noted above cruel treatment has long been a feature of incarceration taken to extremes such treatment might be described as torture torture has for much of history been seen as a tolerable or even necessary component of imprisonment whether performed as punishment or as part of interrogation recent controversial cases described by critics as

impression of islamic justice is a rather barbaric image of retribution harshly and violently administered ask even educated americans to explain the law in muslim countries and they ll inevitably talk about hands and heads summarily being severed in fact islamic justice shares much with christianity and judaism these similarities are not surprising considering that our penal systems are influenced by common scriptural foundations the qur an s most basic passage pertaining to punishment is a familiar one to christians and jews alike and we prescribed for them therein the life for the life and the eye for the eye and the nose for the nose and the ear for the ear and the tooth for the tooth and for wounds equality that said even in talmudic times this was never intended for jews to be taken literally and has always been interpreted by the rabbis to indicate that appropriate compensation be paid in the form of money the opinion that increasing the severity of punishments will result in decrease of recidivism is not supported by some metastudies of this issue contrary to this popular opinion the majority of research studies indicates that penal policies stressing rehabilitation over punishment result in lower recidivism rates most empirical studies consistently find that the employment status after the release from prison is the strongest predictor of recidivism thus e g pennsylvania s 2000 legislative report on recidivism concludes that most studies found that boot camps have not been very successful in achieving the goal of reducing crime and that the fact that employed offenders are almost three times as likely to succeed indicates that providing vocational training and employment opportunities for offenders should be a high priority

 id=362979 title culture of malta nonfiltered 115 processed 112 dbindex 1560114 the culture of malta is a reflection of various cultures that have come into contact with the maltese islands throughout the centuries including neighbouring mediterranean cultures and the cultures of the nations that ruled malta for long periods of time prior to its independence in 1964 the culture of prehistoric malta the earliest inhabitants of the maltese islands are believed to have been farmers who crossed over from nearby sicily sometime before 5000 bce they grew cereals and raised domestic livestock and in keeping with many other ancient mediterranean cultures worshipped a mother goddess represented in malta by statuettes of unusually large proportions pottery from the earliest period of maltese civilization known as the g ar dalam phase is similar to that found in agrigento sicily these people were either supplanted or gave rise to a mysterious culture of megalithic temple builders whose surviving monuments on malta and gozo are now believed to be the oldest standing stone structures in the world the temples date from 4000 2500 bce and typically consist of a complex trefoil cloverleaf design little is known about the temple builders of malta and gozo however there is some evidence that their rituals included animal sacrifice this culture disappeared from the maltese islands around 2500 bce the reasons for the disappearance are shrouded in mystery although historians and archeologists have speculated that the temple builders fell victim to famine and disease war is unlikely to have been the cause of their disappearance since archeological digs on malta have yielded little or no evidence of weapons the maltese islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of bronze age immigrants a culture that is known to have cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to malta the development of modern maltese culture the culture of modern malta has been described as a rich pattern of traditions beliefs and practices which is the result of a long process of adaptation assimilation and cross fertilization of beliefs and usages drawn from various conflicting sources it has been subjected to the same complex historic processes that gave rise to the linguistic and ethnic admixture that defines who the people of malta and gozo are today origins maltese culture has both semitic and romance origins however the romance element is more readily apparent in modern malta for several key reasons i political and cultural affinities between the maltese and their northern mediterranean neighbours ii the fact that romance cultures have had more recent and virtually continuous impact on malta over the past eight centuries and iii the religious beliefs traditions and ceremonies that malta shares in common with its sicilian neighbour the ascendancy of romance influences over the semitic origins of maltese culture and folklore in latter centuries may also be an innate response to frequent national calamities including loss of property forced labour and enslavement suffered by the maltese from the 9th century through to the early 16th century due to piracy and raids of their islands primarily at the hands of the hafsids of north africa and turkish corsairs the most recent and arguably most devastating such incidents occurred in 1551 when the saracens led by dragut reis raided gozo taking almost the entire population of that island away into slavery and in 1565 when the ottoman empire again led by dragut invaded and besieged malta although the knights and the maltese were ultimately victorious against the ottoman forces victory came at a high cost one third of the population of malta is said to have perished in battle these dramatic incidents remain etched in the collective memory of the maltese and are reflected in some maltese superstitions beliefs sayings and proverbs sources of semitic influence ancient phoenicians the ancient phoenicians inhabited the maltese islands around 700 bce and made extensive use of their sheltered harbours by 480 bce with the ascendancy of carthage in the western mediterranean malta became a punic colony traditional maltese folklore suggests phoenician origins for the maltese people and their customs however modern scholars dispute whether any pre arab phoenician substratum still survives today in the language culture and traditions of malta algerian legend claims that the ancestors of the present maltese together with the first algerians fled from their original homeland of aram with some choosing to settle in malta and others in north africa which would suggest that the prototypical maltese culture had aramaean origins another legend suggests that the maltese are descended from shepherd tribes who fled bethlehem in the face of an advancing enemy set sail from jaffa and settled in malta there is also some evidence that at least one north african tribe the oulad said claim that they share common ancestry with the maltese whether its origins can be found in the eastern mediterranean or north africa the impact on malta of punic culture is believed to have persisted long after the island s incorporation into the roman republic in 218 bce at least during the first few centuries of roman rule tradition customs and language were still punic despite romanization of the place this is in agreement with what can be read in the acts of the apostles which call the maltese barbarians that is using a language that was neither greek nor latin but punic arab conquest a period of arabization is said to have followed the conquest of malta by the arabs however it is difficult to trace a continuous line of cultural development during this time since various historians have reported that the maltese islands were depopulated or sparsely populated following the arab invasion of 870 ce some historians have speculated that the maltese were decimated during the invasion or carried off into slavery or perhaps that they escaped to sicily and elsewhere according to the rawd al mi r f khabar al aq r the scented garden of information about places after the capture of malta by the aghlabids the islands were left depopulated wasted and abandoned khirba ghayr hila visited by arabs from time to time solely for the purpose of gathering honey and timber and catching fish up to two hundred years after the conquest of malta by count roger the norman there continued to be significant differences between the customs and usages of the inhabitants of malta as compared to those prevalent in other parts of the kingdom of two sicilies homines insularum ipsarum vivunt aliis moribus et constitutionibus quam alii homines regni nostri sicilie it should be noted however that the population of malta at that time amounted to no more than 1 119 households of whom 836 were described as saracens arab influence is evident in traditional maltese architecture in the names of many maltese towns and villages and in the spoken form of the maltese language slavery semitic influences over maltese customs and traditions are now believed to have continued unabated during the 268 year rule of the knights of st john over malta due in part to trade between the knights and north africa but primarily due to the large numbers of slaves present in malta during the 17th and 18th centuries upwards of 2 000 at any given time or about 5 per cent of the population of malta of whom 40 45 per cent were moors and the remainder turks jews and africans the slaves were engaged in construction in shipbuilding and repair baking the manufacture of armour cloth and rope and the transportation of knights and noble maltese by sedan chair they were also occasionally permitted to engage in their own trades for their own account including hairdressing shoemaking woodcarving as water vendors and cooks which would have brought them into close and frequent contact with the local population in towns and villages many maltese superstitions including belief in the evil eye can be attributed to the impact of the slave population in malta during this period inquisitor federico borromeo iuniore reported in 1653 that slaves strolled along the street of valletta under the pretext of selling merchandise spreading among the women and simple minded persons any kind of superstition charms love remedies and other similar vanities a significant number of slaves converted to christianity were emancipated or even adopted by their maltese patrons granted permission to marry and essentially integrated into the maltese population which may have further entrenched their native customs and beliefs into maltese culture jews a number of jewish families resided in malta almost consistently from approximately 1500 bce to the 1492 edict of expulsion and again from the time of the knights of malta through to the present this can be seen as yet another source of semitic influence in maltese culture according to local legend the earliest jewish residents arrived in malta some 3 500 years ago when the seafaring tribes of zebulon and asher accompanied the ancient phoenicians in their voyages across the mediterranean the earliest evidence of a jewish presence on malta is an inscription in the inner apse of the southern temple of gantija in xag ra which says in the phoenician alphabet to the love of our father jahwe there is also evidence of a jewish community on malta during the roman period in the form of carved menorahs the catacombs in malta members of the malta s jewish community are known to have risen to the highest ranks of the civil service during the period of arab occupation including the rank of vizier by 1240 according to a report prepared for emperor frederick ii there were 47 christian and 25 jewish families on malta and 200 christian and 8 jewish families on gozo unlike the jewish experience in the rest of europe throughout the middle ages the jews of malta generally resided among the general population rather than in ghettos frequently becoming landowners the jewish population of malta had flourished throughout the period of norman rule such that one third of the population of malta s ancient capital mdina is said to have been jewish in 1492 in response to the alhambra decree the royal council had argued unsuccessfully that the expulsion of the jews would radically reduce the total population of the maltese islands and that malta should therefore be treated as a special case within the spanish empire nonetheless the decree of expulsion was signed in palermo on june 18 1492 giving the jewish population of malta and sicily three months to leave numerous forced conversions to catholicism or exile followed evidence of these conversions can be found in many maltese family names that still survive today such as the families ellul salamone mamo and azzopardi a new but much smaller jewish community developed under the rule of the knights of malta but this consisted primarily of slaves and emancipated slaves during this period the jews were frequently ordered to reside in valletta s prisons at night while by day they remained free to transact business trade and commerce among the general population traces of a significant jewish presence on malta can still be found in local place names such as bir meyru meyer s well nien il lhud the jew s garden and al muxi moshé s farm sources of romance influence catholicism it is said that in malta gozo and comino there are more than 360 churches or one church for every 1 000 residents the parish church maltese il parro a or il knisja parrokjali is the architectural and geographic focal point of every maltese town and village and its main source of civic pride this civic pride manifests itself in spectacular fashion during the local village festas which mark the feast day of the patron saint of each parish with marching bands religious processions special masses fireworks especially petards and other festivities making allowances for a possible break in the appointment of bishops to malta during the period of arab rule 869 to 1127 ce the maltese church is frequently referred to today as the only extant apostolic see other than rome itself according to tradition and as recorded in the acts of the apostles the church in malta was founded by st paul in 70 ce following his shipwreck on these islands the earliest christian place of worship in malta is therefore said to be the cavern on the north east of malta now known as st paul s grotto where st paul was reputedly imprisoned during his stay on malta there is evidence of christian burials and rituals having taken place in the general vicinity of the grotto but these date back to no earlier than the 3rd century ce further evidence of christian practices and beliefs during the period of roman persecution can be found in the many catacombs that lie beneath various parts of malta including st paul s catacombs and st agatha s catacombs in rabat just outside the walls of mdina the latter in particular were beautifully frescoed between 1200 and 1480 although they were defaced by marauding turks in the 1550s there are also a number of cave churches including the grotto at mellie a which is a shrine of the nativity of our lady where according to legend st luke painted a picture of the madonna it has been a place of pilgrimage since medieval times the writings of classic maltese historian gian francesco abela are in large part responsible for the widely held belief that following their conversion to christianity the maltese somehow retained their ancient punic language and their new christian religion despite 258 years of moslem rule this was the dominant myth of maltese identity which survived largely unscathed until the 1960s it is now recognized that abela s writings were in part designed to assist the knights of malta in their efforts to win the hearts and minds of the maltese by demonstrating that malta had been ordained by god as a bulwark of christian european civilization against the spread of mediterranean islam modern historians now accept that christianity largely disappeared from malta under the arabs and did not resume its role as the religion of the majority of maltese until norman rule over malta brought mass immigration to malta from italy in the 12th and 13th centuries for centuries leadership over the church in malta was generally provided by the diocese of palermo except under charles of anjou who caused maltese bishops to be appointed as did on rare occasions the spanish and later the knights this further enhanced malta s cultural connections with sicily and italy and may have contributed to the entrenchment from the 15th century to the early 20th century of italian as malta s primary language of culture and learning since 1808 all bishops of malta have been maltese as a result of the norman and spanish periods and the rule of the knights malta became the devout catholic nation that it is today it is worth noting that the office of the holy inquisitor had a very long tenure in malta following its establishment in 1530 the last inquisitor departed from the islands in 1798 after the knights capitulated to the forces of napoleon bonaparte spain traces of the ascendancy of the crown of aragon in the mediterranean and spanish governance over malta from 1282 to 1530 are still evident in maltese culture today these include culinary religious and musical influences two examples are the enduring importance of the spanish guitar maltese il kitarra spanjola in maltese folk music and the enclosed wooden balconies maltese gallerija that grace traditional maltese homes today it is also possible that the traditional maltese costume the faldetta is a local variation of the spanish mantilla the spanish period also saw the establishment of the maltese nobility with the creation of malta s oldest extent title the barony of djar il bniet e buqana and numerous others under spanish rule malta developed into a feudal state from time to time during this period the islands were nominally ruled by various counts of malta who were typically illegitimate sons of the reigning aragonese monarch however the day to day administration of the country was essentially in the hands of the local nobility through their governing council known as the università some of malta s premier noble families including the inguanez family settled in malta from spain and sicily during this time other maltese families of spanish origin include calleja alagona aragona abela flores guzman and xerri the period of spanish rule over malta lasted roughly as long as the period of arab rule however this appears to have had little impact on the language spoken in rural malta which remained heavily influenced by arabic with semitic morphemes this is evident in pietro caxaro s il cantilena the oldest known literary text in maltese which was written prior to 1485 at the height of the spanish period the knights of st john the population of malta increased considerably during the rule of the knights from 25 000 in 1535 to over 40 000 in 1621 to over 54 463 in 1632 by 1798 when the knights surrendered malta to the forces of napoleon bonaparte the population of malta had increased to 114 000 the period of the knights is often referred to as malta s golden age as a result of the architectural and artistic embellishment of the islands by their resident rulers and as a result of advances in the overall health education and prosperity of the local population during this period music literature theatre and the visual arts all flourished in malta during this period which also saw the foundation and development of many of the renaissance and baroque towns and villages palaces and gardens of malta the most notable of which is the capital city valletta a significant number of western european nobles clerics and civil servants relocated to malta during the time of the knights the wealth and influence of malta s noble families many of whom trace their ancestry back to the norman and spanish monarchs who ruled malta prior to the knights was also greatly enhanced during this period maltese education in particular took a significant leap forward under the knights with the foundation in 1530 of the collegium melitensae precursor to today s university of malta through the intercession of pope clement viii as a result the university of malta is one of the oldest extant universities in europe and the oldest commonwealth university outside of the united kingdom the school of anatomy and surgery was established by grand master fra nicolas cotoner at the sacra infermeria in valletta in 1676 the sacra infermeria itself was known as one of the finest and most advanced hospitals in europe sicily located just 60 miles to the north sicily has provided malta with a virtually continuous exchange of knowledge ideas customs and beliefs throughout recorded history many modern maltese families trace their origins to various parts of sicily and southern italy the geographic proximity has facilitated a considerable amount of intermarriage cross migration and trade between the two groups of islands it is likely that this was just as true during the period of arab domination over sicily as it has been since the norman liberation of sicily in 1060 ce accordingly it is difficult to determine whether some of the semitic influences on maltese culture were originally imported to malta from north africa or from sicily the sicilian influence on maltese culture is extensive and is especially evident in the local cuisine with its emphasis on olive oil pasta seafood fresh fruits and vegetables especially the tomato traditional appetizers such as caponata maltese kapunata and rice balls arancini speciality dishes such as rice timbale maltese ross fil forn and sweets such as the cassata and cannoli sicilian influence is also evident in many of the local superstitions in simple children s nursery rhymes and in the devotion to certain saints especially st agatha centuries of dependence on the diocese of palermo brought many sicilian religious traditions to malta including the christmas crib maltese il presepju the ritual visiting of several altars of repose on good friday maltese sepulkri and the graphic grim realism of traditional maltese religious images and sculpture french rule french rule over malta although brief left a deep and lasting impression on maltese culture and society several of the grand masters of the knights of malta had been french and though some french customs and expressions had crept into common usage in malta as a result such as the expression bon u for good day and bonswa for good evening still in use today however napoleon s garrison had a much deeper impact on maltese culture within six days following the capitulation by grand master hompesch on board l orient bonaparte had given malta a constitution and introduced the republican concept of liberté egalite fraternité to malta scions of maltese nobility were ordered to burn their patents and other written evidence of their pedigrees before the arbre de la liberté that had been hastily erected in st george s square at the centre of valletta a secondary school system was established and the legal system of malta was entirely revised under the rule of general vaubois civil marriages were introduced to malta and all non maltese clergymen and women were ordered to leave the islands a wholesale plundering of the gold silver and precious art of maltese churches followed and several monasteries were forceably taken from the religious orders the maltese were scandalized by the desecration of their churches a popular uprising culminated with the defenestration of citizen masson commandant of the french garrison and the summary execution of a handful of maltese patriots led by dun mikiel xerri with the french blockaded behind the walls of valletta a national assembly of maltese was formed petitions were sent out to the king of the two sicilies and to lord nelson soliciting their aid and support the french garrison capitulated to nelson in grand harbour on september 5 1800 british malta british rule from 1800 to 1964 radically and permanently transformed the language culture and politics of malta malta s position in the british empire was unique in that it did not come about by conquest or by colonization but at the voluntary request of the maltese people britain found in malta an ancient christian culture strongly influenced by neighbouring italy and sicily and loyal to the roman catholic church malta s primary utility to great britain was its excellent natural harbours and its strategic location and for many decades malta was essentially a fortress colony throughout the 19th century malta benefited from increased defence spending by britain particularly from the development of the dockyards and the harbour facilities the crimean war and the opening of the suez canal further enhanced malta s importance as a supply station and as a naval base prosperity brought with it a dramatic rise in the population from 114 000 in 1842 to 124 000 in 1851 140 000 in 1870 and double that amount by 1914 malta became increasingly urbanized with the majority of the population inhabiting the valletta and the three cities ironically malta s fortunes waned during times of peace in the early 20th century and again after world war ii leading to massive waves of emigration although malta remained heavily dependent on british military spending successive british governors brought advances in medicine education industry and argiculture to malta the british legacy in malta is evident in the adoption of english as an official language it has now firmly replaced italian as the primary language of tertiary education business and commerce in malta british traditions that live on in malta include a relatively efficient civil service a military that is based on the british model a westminster style parliamentary structure although in malta it is unicameral a governmental structure premised on the rule of law and the widely popular annual christmas pantomime at the manoel theatre the impact of migration malta has always been a maritime nation and for centuries there has been extensive interaction between maltese sailors and fishermen and their counterparts around the mediterranean and into the atlantic ocean more significantly by the mid 19th century the maltese already had a long history of migration to various places including egypt tripolitania tunisia algeria cyprus the ionian islands greece sicily and lampedusa intermarriage with other nationals especially italians and sicilians was not uncommon migrants would periodically return to malta bringing with them new customs and traditions that over time have been absorbed into mainstream maltese culture the extensive impact of migration on malta is illustrated by the following statistics in 1842 the total number of maltese emigrants was estimated at around 20 000 or 15 percent of the population of malta these numbers increased steadily throughout the 1800s the maltese were distributed as follows however these early migration patterns were unstable and repatriation occurred frequently for example many maltese emigrants rushed back to their homeland due to an outbreak of plague in egypt in 1835 and again in 1840 during the anglo egyptian crisis see london straits convention according to pullicino in spite of a certain amount of isolation there must have been a measure of adaptation by maltese emigrants to local customs food and dress besides the frequent comings and goings of the maltese in the 19th century must have facilitated the assimilation of at least some folklore material from north africa that still needs to be identified there was heavy migration from malta in the early 20th century and again after world war ii until the early 1980s however the destinations of choice during this period tended to be more distant english speaking countries rather than the traditional mediterranean littoral over 10 000 maltese settled in australia canada the united kingdom and the united states between 1918 and 1920 followed by another 90 000 or 30 percent of the population of malta between 1948 and 1967 by 1996 the net emigration from malta during the 20th century exceeded 120 000 or 33 5 of the population of malta familiarity with the english language assisted maltese migrants to assimilate in their adopted countries and the incidence of intermarriage with foreigners is reputedly higher among maltese emigrants than other ethnic communities extensive interaction between maltese emigrants in australia canada the united kingdom and the united states and their relatives in malta has further westernized maltese culture many maltese emigrants and second generation maltese australians maltese americans and maltese canadians returned to their homeland in the 1990s and recent years have seen an increase in the number of foreign expatriates moving to malta especially british retirees this has created an increasingly cosmopolitan environment in the towns and villages of malta the impact of world war ii and telecommunications the advent of radio and television and the steady increase in the availability of foreign newspapers and magazines throughout the 20th century extended the impact of italian culture on malta however with the adoption of english as one of malta s national languages in 1936 and perhaps as an indirect result of the brutal devastation suffered by the maltese at the hands of mussolini s reggia aeronautica and the luftwaffe during world war ii the united kingdom has arguably replaced neighbouring italy and sicily as the dominant source of cultural influences on modern malta over the past two or three generations english has replaced italian as the language of business culture and learning in malta globalization and increased internet usage approx 78 1 of the population of malta as of sept 2005 is also having a significant effect on maltese culture as of december 22 2006 malta had the fourth highest rate of internet usage in the world education education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16 years while the state provides education free of charge the church and the private sector run a number of schools in malta and gozo most of the teachers salary in church schools is paid by the state education in malta is based on the british model religion today the constitution of malta provides for freedom of religion but establishes roman catholicism as the state religion freedom house and the world factbook report that 98 percent of the maltese profess roman catholicism as their religion making malta one of the most catholic countries in the world however the sunday mass attendance census 2005 commissioned by the church of malta reports that as of 2005 only 52 6 of the population attended religious services on a regular basis languages the national language of malta is maltese the maltese alphabet is based on the latin alphabet but uses the diacritically altered letters also found in polish as well as the letters and which are unique to maltese the official languages are english and maltese italian french and german are also widely spoken and taught in secondary schools though the latter two less so folklore and traditions maltese folklore traditions and legends still live in the minds of the older generations and these are slowly being studied and categorized like any other european tradition festas local festivals similar to those in southern italy are commonplace in malta and gozo celebrating weddings christenings and most prominently saints days honouring the patron saint of the local parish on saints days the festa reaches its apex with a high mass featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint after which a statue of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession with the faithful following in respectful prayer the religious atmosphere quickly gives way to several days of revelry band processions fireworks and late night parties in the weeks leading up to a local festa the main streets around the parish are richly decorated with brocade banners ornate religious sculptures mounted on pedestals and all around the zuntier parvis of the parish church hawkers set up stalls stocked with traditional maltese food and the local variety of nougat the parish church itself is typically illuminated at night although the fjakkoli flaming lanterns of yesteryear have been supplanted with bright coloured electric bulbs several festi take place in different towns and villages across malta every weekend in the summer some of the seaside towns feature a unique and popular medieval game known as the ostra although the word itself is derived from the italian giostra maltese ostra has little in common with medieval jousting and is in fact derived from the neapolitan game of the cockaigne pole it involves a 10 metre long greased pole mounted on a barge out in the bay perched on a precarious angle out over the sea competing youths scramble up the pole in an attempt to snatch a pennant flag or other trophy from the top of the pole the catholic church in malta has frequently expressed its disapproval of the excessive and often underage drinking and parochial rivalry that have come to be associated with festi weddings traditional maltese weddings featured the bridal party walking in procession beneath an ornate canopy from the home of the bride s family to the parish church with singers trailing behind serenading the bride and groom however this custom has long since disappeared from the islands curiously the maltese word for this custom il ilwa corresponds with an identical arabic word which is used to refer to a gift presented by a husband to his spouse birth and childhood traditional maltese proverbs reveal a cultural preoccupation with childbearing and fertility i wie ming ajr tarbija ma fihx tgawdija a childless marriage cannot be a happy one this is a belief that malta shares with many other mediterranean cultures most notably palestine and morocco in maltese folktales the local variant of the classic closing formula and they all lived happily ever after is u g ammru u tg ammru u spi at and they lived together and they had children together and the tale is finished rural malta shares in common with sicily morocco and traditional jewish society a number of superstitions regarding fertility menstruation and pregnancy including the avoidance of cemeteries during the months leading up to childbirth and avoiding the preparation of certain foods during menses pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their cravings for specific foods out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark maltese xewqa literally desire or craving maltese and sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth whether the baby is carried high or low during pregnancy and the movement of a wedding ring dangled on a string above the abdomen sideways denoting a girl back and forth denoting a boy traditionally maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible partly out of fear of limbo should the child die in infancy and partly because according to maltese and sicilian folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a christian but still a turk traditional maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include biskuttini tal mag mudija almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing it torta tal marmorata a spicy heart shaped tart of chocolate flavoured almond paste and a liqeur known as ro olin made with rose petals violets and almonds on a child s first birthday in a tradition that still survives today maltese parents would organize a game known as il qu ija where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child these may include a hard boiled egg a bible crucifix or rosary beads a book and so on whichever object the child shows most interest in is said to reveal the child s path and fortunes in adulthood the weather in rural parts of malta and gozo locals engage in a curious form of weather forecasting in the days leading up to christmas from st lucy s day december 13 to christmas eve december 24 cloud formations and weather conditions on each successive day are said to presage or approximate the weather conditions of one specific month of the following year the signs observed on these twelve days are referred to as the rules maltese l irwiegel in this instance we can drawn an immediate parallel with a local sicilian tradition and proverb di li carènnuli si canusci l annata li dudici misi di l anni novu si cumincianu di li dudici jorna prima di natali variations of this customs also appear in normandy and in other parts of northern europe mnarja mnarja or l imnarja pronounced lim nar ya is one of the most important dates on the maltese cultural calendar officially it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of saints peter and st paul in fact its roots can be traced back to the pagan roman feast of luminaria literally the illumination when the early summer night of june 29 was illuminated by torches and bonfires a national feast since the rule of the knights mnarja is a traditional maltese festival of food religion and music the festivities still commence today with the reading of the bandu an official governmental announcement which has been read on this day in malta since the 16th century originally mnarja was celebrated outside st paul s grotto in the north of malta however by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the cathedral of st paul in mdina and featured torchlight processions the firing of 100 petards horseraces and races for men boys and slaves modern mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of buskett just outside the town of rabat it is said that under the knights this was the one day in the year when the maltese were allowed to hunt and eat wild rabbit which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the knights the close connection between mnarja and rabbit stew maltese fenkata remains strong today in 1854 british governor william reid launched an agricultural show at buskett which is still being held today the farmers exhibition is still a seminal part of the mnarja festivities today mnarja today is one of the few occasions when participants may hear traditional maltese g ana traditionally grooms would promise to take their newly or recently wed brides to mnarja during the first of year of marriage and for luck many of the brides would attend in their full wedding gown and veil although this custom has long since disappeared from the islands carnival carnival maltese il karnival ta malta has had an important place on the cultural calendar for just under five centuries having been introduced to the islands by grand master piero de ponte in 1535 it is held during the week leading up to ash wednesday and typically includes masked balls fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions lavish late night parties a colourful ticker tape parade of allegorical floats presided over by king carnival maltese ir re tal karnival marching bands and costumed revellers traditional carnival dances include the parata which is a lighthearted re enactment of the 1565 victory of the knights over the turks and an 18th century court dance known as il maltija grand master marc antonio zondadari introduced the game of kukkanja cockaigne to carnival in 1721 on a given signal the crowd assembled in palace square converged on a collection of hams sausages and live animals hidden beneath leafy branches outside the guard house the provisions became the property of those who having seized them were able to carry them off traditional carnival foods includes perlini multi coloured sugar coated almonds and the prinjolata which is a towering assembly of sponge cake biscuits almonds and citrus fruits topped with cream and pine nuts under the rule of the knights carnival was the only time of year when the maltese were permitted to wear masks in public carnival parades during the british period especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries were noted for their biting satirical themes and many of the intricate floats were designed to poke fun at political figures and unpopular government decisions however political satire was essentially banned as a result of a law passed in 1936 although most carnival activities tend to take place in and around the capital cities of valletta and victoria there are several spontaneous carnivals in more remote villages of malta and gozo most notably in nadur the nadur carnival is famous for its darker and more risqué themes including cross dressing and revellers dressed up as scantily clad clergyfolk maltese holy week numerous religious traditions most of them inherited from one generation to the next are part of the paschal celebrations in the maltese islands honouring the death and resurrection of jesus the event starts on ash wednesday and ends on easter sunday until recently throughout the lenten period the interior of maltese churches would be draped in purple with statues and paintings covered in mourning crêpe representations of the last supper table are put up in many towns and villages and typically the food used in these displays is distributed among the poor and needy of the parish the good friday ritual in malta includes visits to seven tabernacles or altars of repose in seven different churches sombre and solemn religious processions and pageants are held in many towns and villages with statues and costumed local amateur actors representing scenes from the passion of christ in some parts of malta these processions will include a number of penitents dressed in white robes and hoods walking barefoot or occasionally with chains tied to their ankles as an act of penance or in fulfillment of a vow this is a unique medieval tradition which still survives today easter sunday in malta by contrast is marked by the incessant pealing of church bells and festive fast paced processions with the youth of each town running through the streets bearing sculptures of the risen christ traditional maltese food for the lenten period includes qag aq tal appostli apostles rings which are circular loaves of unleavened bread studded with roasted almonds and sprinkled with sesame seeds and honey cakes known as kware imal the name refers to the quadragesima or 40 days of lent on easter sunday children are rewarded for their abstinence from sweets throughout lent by means of a figolla or easter cookie made with almond paste covered in sweet coloured icing and formed in a festive shape such as a rabbit a baby chick a duck or a traditional maltese fishing boat dg ajsa arts and crafts lace making traditional maltese lace maltese bizilla is bobbin lace of the filet guipure variety it is formed on a lace pillow stuffed with straw and frequently features the eight pointed maltese cross but not necessarily genoese style leafwork is an essential component of the traditional designs nowadays malta lace is usually worked on ivory coloured linen although historically it was also worked on black or white silk it is typically used to make tablecloths placemats and serviettes and is periodically featured in couture and in traditional maltese costume lace making has been prevalent in malta since the 16th century and was probably introduced to the islands at roughly the same time as in genoa lace was included with other articles in a bando or proclamation enacted by grand master ramon perellos y roccaful in 1697 aimed at repressing the wearing of gold silver jewellery gold cloth silks and other materials of value there was a resurgance of lace making in malta around 1833 which has been attributed to a certain lady hamilton chichester queen victoria is said to be particularly fond of wearing malta lace in 1839 thomas mcgill noted in a handbook or guide for strangers visiting malta that the females of the island make also excellent lace the lace mitts and gloves wrought by the malta girls are bought by all ladies coming to the island orders from england are often sent for them on account of

horse races that take place annually on saqqajja hill in rabat on june 29 date back to the 15th century these races form part of the traditional celebrations of the feast of saints peter and paul il festa tal imnarja and were greatly encouraged by the knights of malta especially during the reign of grand masters de verdalle and de lascaris castellar the knights took these races very seriously bonelli records a proclamation issued by the grand masters of the era which threatened anyone caught interfering with or obstructing a racing horse with forced labour on board the galleys of the knights the tradition was revived and strengthened after the first world war under british governor lord plumer the racecourse at marsa which was founded in 1868 boasted one of the longest tracks in

capital city of valletta to the army barracks at mtarfa via mdina and a number of towns and villages the railway fell into disuse and was eventually closed altogether following the introduction of electric trams and buses mussolini s proud announcement at the height of the world war 2 blitz of malta that his forces had destroyed the railway system of malta gave rise to considerable mirth among

recently just in baidoa about 260 kilometers north west of the capital mogadishu violence has plagued somalia since warlords ousted former supreme president mohamed siad barre in 1991 history somalia has been continuously inhabited by numerous and varied ethnic groups some of oromo or other cushitic ancestry but the majority were somalis for the last 2 500 years in late antiquity somalia was known as the land of punt to the ancient egyptians and from the first century ad numerous ports like ancient opone and ancient mosylon bandar gori were trading with roman and greek sailors the northwestern part of somalia was part of the kingdom of aksum from about the 3rd century to the 7th by the early medieval period a d 700 a d 1200 islam became firmly established especially with the founding of mogadishu in a d 900 the late medieval period a d 1201 a d 1500 saw the rise of numerous somali city states and kingdoms in northwestern somalia the sultanate of adal a multi ethnic state comprised of

early and late 17th century somalia saw the growth and gradual rise of many successor city states such as the sultanates of eastern sanag of bari and of hobyo the modern period began when the clouds of colonial conquest gathered in 1884 colonial period the year 1884 ended a long period of comparative peace at the berlin conference of 1884 the scramble for africa started the long and bloody process of the imperial partition of somali lands the french british and italians came to somalia in the late 19th century the british claimed british somaliland as a protectorate in 1886 after the withdrawal of egypt and the treaty with warsangeli clan egypt sought to prevent european colonial expansion in northeast africa the southern area claimed by italy in 1889 became known as italian somaliland the northernmost stretch became part of the french territory of afars and issas also known as french somaliland until it later achieved independence as djibouti the somali war of colonial resistance 1898 1920 was led by somali poet scholar and statesman mohammed abdullah hassan the war ended with the raf s bombing of the sayid s fort with massive loss of civilian and military life on the somali side world war ii fascist italy under the dictatorship of benito mussolini tried to pursue its colonialist expansion policy and attacked abyssinia now ethiopia in 1935 the invasion was condemned by the league of nations but little was done to stop italian military and industrial build up abyssinia was occupied and the government of emperor haile selassie i was exiled to the u k in england the ethiopian emperor appealed to the international community little was done to liberate occupied ethiopia britain would regret the failure of it and its allies to impose sanctions on italy in august 1940 italian troops crossed the ethiopian border and invaded british somalia to take the colony from the united kingdom the invasion was launched on august 3 and concluded with the taking of berbera on august 14 the british launched a campaign in january 1942 from kenya to liberate italian somaliland british somaliland and italian occupied ethiopia again with many somalis being incorporated to fight a war led by foreigners by february most of italian somaliland was captured in march british somaliland was retaken by a sea invasion in 1949 the u n gave somalia as a protectorate to italy until it achieved independence in 1960 the ogaden province of somalia was given to the now repatriated ethiopian government britain kept british somaliland now somaliland or northern somalia under its colonial rule the french too kept djibouti under colonial administration and djibouti would not gain independence until 1977 though somalis and other africans fought hard on the allied side in world war two soon after the conflict they were resubjugated the bitterness of lost hope strengthened the long struggle against colonialism and in most parts of africa including somalia independence movements and liberation struggles occurred 1960s 1990s the independence of the british somaliland protectorate from the united kingdom was proclaimed on 26 june 1960 on 1 july 1960 unification of the british and ex italian somaliland took place the government was formed by abdullahi issa aden abdullah osman daar was appointed as president and abdirashid ali shermarke as prime minister later in 1967 mohammed ibrahim egal became prime minister in the government appointed by abdirishid ali shermarke egal was later chosen as president of the self declared independent somaliland in late 1969 a military government assumed power following the assassination of shermarke who had been chosen and served as president from 1967 1969 mohamed siad barre a general in the armed forces became the president in 1969 following a coup d état the revolutionary army leaders headed by siad barre established large scale public works programmes they also successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign in which they helped to dramatically increase the literacy rate from a mere 5 to 55 by the mid 1980s in the meantime barre assassinated a major figure in his cabinet major general gabiere and two other officials between 1977 and 1978 somalia fought with its neighbour ethiopia in the ogaden war the goal of somali nationalism was to liberate and unite the somali lands divided and subjugated under colonialism the somali state engaged its neighbours kenya and ethiopia diplomatically hoping to win the right of self determination for ethnic somalis in those countries somalis in ogaden province in ethiopia suffered immensely as have other ethiopians under the brutal rule of haile selassie and the new communist regime however somalis were being expelled from ogaden province and somalia already preparing for war since the failure of diplomacy supported the ogaden peoples liberation front onlf then called western somalia liberation front wslf eventually somalia sought to capture ogaden province and acted unilaterally without consulting the international community which was generally opposed to redrawing colonial boundaries somalia s communist allies the soviet union and the warsaw pact refused to help somalia and instead backed ethiopia for most of the war somalia appeared to be winning and in fact retook most of ogaden province with somali forces at the gates of addis ababa soviet and cuban forces and weapons came to the aid of ethiopia the somali army was decimated and soon defeated during the soviet and cuban intervention somalia sought the help of the united states the carter administration originally expressed interest in helping somalia and then later declined american allies in the middle east and asia also refused to assist somalia the americans perhaps did not want to engage the soviets in this period of détente in 1978 the moral authority of the somali government collapsed with many somalis becoming disillusioned with life under military dictatorship the regime in the 1980s weakened as the cold war drew to a close and somalia s strategic importance was diminished the government became increasingly totalitarian and resistance movements encouraged by ethiopia for its own strategic interests sprang up across the country eventually leading to civil war in 1991 in 1991 first insurgent forces led by abdullahi yusuf ahmed leader of the somali salvation democratic front and president ali mahdi mohamed was unrecognised as the interim president by some factions the same year the northern portion of the country declared its independence as somaliland although de facto independent and relatively stable compared to the tumultuous south it has not been recognized by any foreign government in the period 1991 1992 a split in the southern united somali congress which led efforts to unseat barre caused an escalation in the civil war especially in the mogadishu area following the failure of united nations operation restore hope and beginning in 1993 a two year un effort primarily in the south was able to alleviate famine conditions the un contingent was at times led by

organization in 2002 southwestern somalia comprising bay bakool middle juba gedo lower shabelle and lower juba provinces of somalia declared itself autonomous however at the time of its declaration the rahanweyn resistance army established in 1999 was in full control of bay and bakool and parts of gedo and middle juba regions only this temporary secession was reasserted in 2002 leading to de facto autonomy of southwestern somalia an internal armed conflict between hasan muhammad nur shatigadud and his two deputies weakened it militarily from february 2006 this area and the city of baidoa became central to the transitional federal government in 2004 the transitional federal government tfg organized and wrote a charter for the governing of the nation the government wrote the charter in nairobi the tfg capital is presently in baidoa in 2006 the islamic courts union rose to predominant control of somalia they took over the capital of mogadishu in the second battle of mogadishu in may

africa affecting 350 000 people 2006 civil war a conflict to unseat warlords broke out in may 2006 the battle was fought between an alliance of mogadishu warlords known as the alliance for the restoration of peace and counter terrorism or arpct and a militia loyal to islamic courts union or icu the conflict began in mid february several hundred people mostly civilians died in the crossfire mogadishu residents described it as the worst fighting in more than a decade the islamists accused the u s of funding the warlords through the central intelligence agency in an effort to prevent the islamists gaining power the u s state department while neither admitting nor denying this said the u s had taken no action that violated the international arms embargo of somalia a few e mails describing covert illegal operations by private military companies in breach of un regulations have been reported by the uk sunday newspaper the observer the u n maintains an arms embargo on somalia and some have alleged that the u s broke international law by supplying the mogadishu warlords on june 5 2006 the islamic militia said it had taken control of the whole of mogadishu following the second battle of mogadishu on 14 june 2006 the last arpct stronghold in southern somalia the town of jowhar fell with little resistance to the icu the remaining arpct forces fled to the east or across the border into ethiopia the warlords alliance effectively collapsed the transitional government called for intervention by a regional east african peacekeeping force icu leaders opposed this and lobbied african union au member states at an au ceremony in libya on september 9 2006 to abandon plans to send peacekeepers to somalia the islamists are fiercely opposed to foreign troops particularly ethiopians in somalia somalia and ethiopia fought a bitter war in 1977 78 over the somali province of ogaden which has been ruled by the ethiopians since the partition of somali lands in the first half of the 20th century in addition the icu claimed that ethiopia with its long history as an imperial power seeks to occupy somalia or rule it by proxy steadily the islamist militia backing the icu took control of much of the southern half of somalia normally through negotiation with local clan chiefs rather than by the use of force the islamists stayed clear of the government headquarters town of baidoa which ethiopia said it would protect if threatened but on september 25 2006 the icu moved into the southern port of kismayo the last remaining port held by the transitional government many somalian refugees as well as the un recognised transitional government of somalia then lived close to the border of ethiopia protected by ethiopian troops the islamist militia issued a jihad against ethiopia on october 9 2006 on wednesday november 1 2006 peace talks between the un recognized interim government in the north and the islamists of the south broke down the international community feared an all out civil war with ethiopian and rival eritrean forces backing opposing sides in the power struggle and political deadlock between the appointed transitional government and the icu war erupted on thursday december 21 2006 when the leader of icu sheik hassan dahir aweys said somalia is in a state of war and all somalis should take part in this struggle against ethiopia after which heavy fighting broke out between the islamist militia on one side and the allied somali government and ethiopian forces on the other side on sunday december 24 2006 ethiopian forces launched unilateral airstrikes against islamist troops and strongpoints across somalia ethiopian information minister berhan hailu stated that targets included the town of buur hakaba near the administration s base in baidoa this was the first use of airstrikes by ethiopia and also its first public admission of involvement in somalia that same day ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi announced that his country was waging war against the islamists to protect his country s sovereignty ethiopian defense forces were forced to enter into war to the protect the sovereignty of the nation and to blunt repeated attacks by islamic courts terrorists and anti ethiopian elements they are supporting he said on monday december 25 2006 ethiopia declared war on the islamic courts and one ethiopian jet fighter strafed the international airport in mogadishu without apparently causing serious damage but prompting the airport to be shut down other ethiopian jet fighters attacked a military airport west of mogadishu days of heavy fighting followed as ethiopian and government troops backed by tanks and jets pushed against islamist forces between baidoa and mogadishu both sides claimed to have inflicted hundreds of casualties but the islamist infantry and vehicle artillery were badly beaten and forced to retreat toward mogadishu on 28 december 2006 the allies entered mogadishu after islamist fighters fled the city the islamists retreated south towards their stronghold in kismayu fighting rearguard actions in several towns they abandoned kismayu too without a fight claiming that their flight was a strategic withdrawal to avoid civilian casualties they entrenched around the small town of ras komboni at the southernmost tip of somalia and on the border with kenya in early january the ethiopians and the somali government attacked capturing the islamist positions and driving the surviving fighters into the hills and forests after several days of combat on tuesday january 9 2007 the united states openly intervened in somalia by sending ac 130 gunships to attack islamist positions in ras kamboni dozens were killed on january 11 and 12 joint u s and ethiopian forces conducted additional airstrikes in the wild countryside near ras kamboni the u s said it was targeting a terrorist cell responsible for the bombings of the u s embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 however the human rights organization oxfam said 70 nomadic herdsmen were killed and 100 wounded in the airstrikes and none of them were combatants politics somalia has had no effective national government since 1991 though there is an internationally recognized government in baidoa this government called the transitional national government controls only baidoa and is not recognized by most somalis to be legitimate the transitional government was appointed abroad by forces historically opposed to somali interests such as ethiopia and various african countries seeking to limit the extent and scope of somali development and eventual encroachment on occupied somali lands in the northwest there is the breakaway republic of somaliland which declared its independence in 1991 this governing zone is not internationally recognized although it has remained more stable and certainly more peaceful than the south and northeast puntland in the northeast declared itself autonomous in 1998 and has not joined the transitional government though the former president of puntland is now the president of the baidoa government and puntland has stated its desire to join a future federated state in the southeastern interior jubaland and southwestern somalia have both joined the baidoa government and its leaders are part of the baidoa parliament the other half of the country with the bulk of the population was controlled until the end of december 2006 by the islamic courts union icu which controlled the critically important cities of mogadishu and since september 24 2006 kismayo as of january 2007 the situation is unstable the islamic courts seek to institute sharia law in somalia social law changes such as the forbidding of chewing khat and even the prohibition against watching movies and soccer in public have become recent movements by the icu to change behaviors and impose strict social morals the council is led by sheikh sharif sheikh ahmed when asked if the icu plans to extend its control to the rest of somalia sheikh ahmed responded in an interview on october 14 2004 somali members of parliament elected abdullahi yusuf previously president of puntland to be the next president because of the situation in mogadishu the election was held in a sports centre in nairobi kenya yusuf was elected transitional president by somalia s transitional parliament he won 189 of the 275 votes from members of parliament the session of parliament was also held in neighbouring kenya his government is recognized by most western nations as legitimate many other small political organizations exist some clan based others seeking a somalia free from clan based politics many of them have come into existence since the civil war in late 2006 the transitional federal government of the somali republic controlled only a relatively small portion of the country by some accounts its control barely extended beyond the limits of its capital city of baidoa the political situation remains unstable for example on september 18 2006 abdullah yusuf barely survived a suicide attack on his convoy in baidoa although twelve other people were killed over the course of late december 2006 the transitional government with the aid of ethiopian troops extended its control over much of the country and the islamists retreated in january 2007 they were attacked in the remote stronghold of ras kamboni in the extreme southern tip of the country capital mogadishu is the capital of somalia in 2006 mogadishu became part of the territory controlled by the islamic courts union while the transitional federal government had its seat in baidoa it was also considered a capital on december 28 2006 troops of the u n backed interim government rolled into mogadishu unopposed putting an end to six months of domination of the capital by a radical islamic movement prime minister ali mohammed ghedi declared that mogadishu had been secured after meeting with local clan leaders to discuss the peaceful hand over of the city geography somalia is located on the east coast of africa on and north of the equator between the gulf of aden on the north and indian ocean on the east together with ethiopia eritrea and djibouti it is often referred to as the horn of africa it borders djibouti on the northwest ethiopia on the west and kenya to the southwest major climatic factors are a year round hot climate seasonal monsoon winds and irregular rainfall with recurring droughts mean daily maximum temperatures range from 30 c to 40 c 85 105 f except at higher elevations and along the east coast mean daily minimums usually vary from about 15 c to 30 c 60 85 f the southwest monsoon a sea breeze makes the period from about may to october the mildest season at mogadishu the december february period of the northeast monsoon is also relatively mild although prevailing climatic conditions in mogadishu are rarely pleasant the tangambili periods that intervene between the two monsoons october november and march may are hot and humid administrative divisions somalia is divided into eighteen regions gobollada sing gobol which in turn are subdivided into districts the regions are health somalia continues to have one of the highest child mortality rates in the world with 10 of children dying at birth and 25 of those surviving birth dying before age five but on the other hand somalia also has one of the lowest hiv infection rates in africa the breadth of the aids pandemic has led to the idea in the west that the entire continent is ravaged by the disease but somalia isolated for 14 years since the civil war began and populated by devout muslims has an infection rate of perhaps only 1 5 or 2 per cent of the adult population education with the collapse of the central government in 1991 the education system is now private primary schools have risen from 600 before the civil war to 1172 schools today with an increase of 28 in primary school enrollment over the last 3 years in 2006 puntland an autonomous state was the first in somalia to introduce free primary schools with teachers now receiving their salaries from the puntland administration in mogadishu the benadir university the al neelain university and the mogadishu university are three of the eight universities that teach higher education in southern somalia in puntland higher education is provided by the puntland state university and in somaliland it s provided by amoud university and burao university three somali universities are currently ranked in the top 100 of africa quranic schools also known as duqsi s remain the basic system of instruction in religion in somalia they provide islamic education for children thereby filling a clear religious and social role in the country known as the most stable local non formal education providing basic religious and moral instruction their strength rests on community support and their use of locally made and widely available teaching materials the qu ranic system which teaches the greatest number of students relative to the other education sub sectors is the only system accessible to nomadic somalis compared to the urban somalis who have easier access to education in 1993 a survey by unicef was conducted in which it found among other things that about 40 of pupils in qu ranic schools were girls this is quite amazing compared to secular education where gender disparity is much greater economy since the collapse of the state somalia has transformed from what mohamed siad barre referred to as scientific socialism to a free market economy due to the lack of government oversight or statistics and the recent war it is difficult to calculate the size or growth of the economy for 1994 the cia estimated gdp at 3 3 billion in 2001 it was estimated to be 4 1 billion in 2005 the cia estimated gdp to be 4 809 billion real growth in 2005 was projected at 2 4 agriculture is the most important sector with livestock accounting for about 40 of gdp and about 65 of export earnings nomads and semi nomads who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood make up a large portion of the population after livestock bananas are the principal export sugar sorghum maize and fish are products for the domestic market the small industrial sector based on the processing of agricultural products accounts for 10 of gdp telecommunications somalia s public telecommunications system was almost completely destroyed or dismantled however private wireless companies thrive in most major cities and actually provide better services than in neighbouring countries wireless service and internet cafés are provided somalia was the last african country to access the internet in august 2000 with only 57 web sites known as of 2003 internet usage in somalia grew 44 900 in the last five years registering the highest in africa somalia has the cheapest cellular calling rates in africa with some companies charging less than a cent a minute competing phone companies have agreed on interconnection standards which were brokered by the united nations funded somali telecom association companies providing telecommunication services are demographics somalia has a population of around 8 863 338 however estimates are very difficult because of the political situation and the mostly nomadic nature of the somalis the last census was in 1975 most outside analysts use this estimate but somalia is one of the fastest growing countries in africa and the world some estimates range between 10 and 15 million there is little reliable statistical information on urbanisation in somalia however rough estimates have been made indicating an urbanisation of 5 and 8 per annum with many towns rapidly growing into cities currently 34 of the somali population lives in towns and cities with the percentage rapidly increasing it is estimated that approximately one third of the population is made up of minority groups including bantu bravenese rerhamar bajuni eyle galgala tumal yibir and gaboye because of the civil war the country has a large diaspora community one of the largest of the whole continent there are over a million somalis outside of africa and this excludes those who have inhabited ogaden province northeastern kenya and djibouti languages somalia is unique in africa because all inhabitants speak a native language somali is the main language minority languages are maay maay in the riverine area and variants of swahili on the southern coast a considerable amount of somalis speak arabic due to religious reasons and ties with the arab world and media english is also widely used and in some pockets in southern somalia italian is also used as a second language barawa is spoken in the southern areas religion the vast majority of somalis are sunni muslims christianity s influence was abolished in the 1970 s when church run schools were closed and missionaries sent home there has been no bishop of the catholic church in the country since 1989 the cathedral in mogadishu has been destroyed the somali constitution prohibits talking about any religion except islam a secret underground christian community exists in certain parts of the country as a result loyalty to islam is what reinforces distinctions that set somalis apart from their immediate african neighbours many of whom are either christians particularly the amhara and others of ethiopia or adherents of indigenous african faiths culture cuisine main article cuisine of somalia cuisine of somalia varies from region to region and it encompasses different styles of cooking one thing that unites the somali food is it s being halal therefore there are no pork dishes alcohol is not served nothing that died on its own is eaten and no blood is incorporated somali people serve dinner as late as 9 pm during ramadan it is often eaten after tarawih prayers sometimes as late as 11 pm cambuulo is one of the most dishes that is liked throughout the country as a dinner the dish is made out of well cooked azuki beans mixed with butter and sugar the beans which by itself is called digir are often left on the stove for as many as five hours on low heat to reach the most desired taste literature main article somali literature somalia produced a large amount of literature through islamic poetry and hadith from somali scholars of the last centuries with the adoption of the latin script in 1973 numerous somali authors have released books over the years which received widespread success nuruddin farah being one of them novels like a crooked rib and links are considered important literary achievements which earned him the 1998 neustadt international prize for literature award list of writers from somalia music main article music of somalia somalia has the distinction of being one of only a handful of african countries that are composed almost entirely of one ethnic group the somalis traditional bands like waaberi horseed have gained a small following outside the country others like maryam mursal have fused somali traditional music with rock bossa nova hip hop and jazz influences most somali music is love orientated but some recall how life was in somalia before the somali civil war and some talk about how somalis should come together to unite and restore the country to its former glory toronto

 id=2318758 title sacrifice computer game nonfiltered 148 processed 145 dbindex 1560148 sacrifice is a 3d real time strategy game with strong rpg elements developed by shiny entertainment the creators of the earthworm jim franchise it was lauded for its original concept graphics and sound quality by most reviews overview sacrifice is a real time strategy rts action hybrid game that differs from most games in the rts genre in that the player assumes control of a particular character on the field the wizard and plays the game from a third person point of view centered on that character and play is very direct in that all creatures are created directly from spells cast by the player in contrast most real time strategy games allow the player to see the battlefield and play the game from a top down point of view and force the player to create buildings which can later be used to manufacture units sacrifice single player campaign consists of 10 sets of missions one for each of five gods that the wizard can choose to work for in addition to having different missions each god also grants its own set of creatures for summoning and spells to be cast to the wizard not only does the player receive different spells from each god but depending on which gods he chooses to support the story changes drastically creating several different endings it is notable that once you serve a god some other gods who sees him her as a rival may not provide you any chance to serve him later hence limited the god you can choose and avoid a triumph combination of creatures and spells the resources a common element in rts games in sacrifice are souls and mana mana is used for casting any spell summoning creatures and is an unlimited slowly generating resource a manafountain is a neutral structure existing on the map and cannot be created throughout the game but provides mana for any players nearby to claim a neutral manafountain to be your own one you can summon a manalith on it so it will provide mana only for you and your friendly creatures manahoars a kind of summoned creatures which costs a soul can draw energy from your manaliths and give you mana even though you are at a distance with your manaliths souls are used for summoning creatures and are limited no new souls can be created during the game souls cannot be destroyed unless a unit falls off the map in which case the soul or souls contained in that creature is forever destroyed several creature abilities such as consume soul and rend soul also destroy the soul but accompanied by other special effects souls exist on the map in two forms blue souls and red souls blue souls are either neutral souls that are placed on the map by the map makers waiting to be picked up by any wizards or souls that are released from the corpse of friendly creatures these blue souls can be picked up directly by the wizard when he walks near it red souls are hostile souls that are released from the corpses of hostile creatures red souls cannot be picked up directly and the wizard has to cast a spell convert to summon a sac doctor that will carry the corpse to its summoner s altar and carry out a ritual to purify the souls during the transportation the sac doctor could be killed and the corpse release back to its former master the sole aim of this game to win is to desecrate the enemy s altar to do this you have to approach your enemy s altar and cast a spell desecrate with one of your creature as a sacrifice a group of sac doctors will be summoned and perform a ritual to desecrate the altar during the process the enemy wizard will suffer damage sent from the ethereal realm the stronger the creature you have sacrificed the more the damage is if he is killed during the process the desecration is done if any of the sac doctors are killed the desecration will be interrupted and your sacrifice offering will be released free a god s power can reveal itself in any part of the world except other god s capitals in which the ultimate altar of that god was set up to collect the faith of the god s people which is the primary necessity of every god gods also establish a connection between themselves and their wizards through a wizard s altar thus wizards are the manifestation of gods to accomplish the god s will wizards can never be truly killed if the connection exists and the god can resurrect the wizard somewhere else but if a wizard is killed and he has no altar or no connection with their god at the time of death they are dead forever and cannot come back story in the single player campaign you play as the wandering wizard eldred a plane jumper who leapt to the current world when his own was destroyed accompanied by the owl like imp zyzyx his familiar his recounting of his recent deeds is the background of the game in his now destroyed homeworld of jhera eldred was a man of substance a lord or a king he doesn t specify though he was most certainly a tyrant and one of many who vied for power he spent his life forging another man s empire but when the young monarch died at far too young an age power and dominion fell to eldred alone despised by his subjects foreign powers and internal conspirators sought to tear his kingdom apart having dabbled in alchemy and conjuration before eldred was forced to turn his hobby into a serious study eventually turning to dark dark forces this resulted in his summoning of the arch demon marduk who promised to destroy his rivals he did but he didn t stop there what eldred didn t know was that marduk was a being of infinite appetite a monster who fed off the worlds to which he was summoned with jhera crumbling into nothingness beneath his feet eldred and zyzyx fled into the astral void eventually washing up in the world in which the game is set this world is ruled by five gods and their wizard champions the gods are persephone self righteous goddess of life she occupies the lush and green lands of elysium capital city idylliac pyro technological industrial god of fire he occupies the burning volcanic wastes of pyroborea capital city helios james good ol boy god of earth he occupies the harsh and rocky glebe capital city agothera stratos vain know it all god of air he occupies the snowy desolate land of empyria capital city thryhring charnel amusingly malevolent god of death he occupies the rotten barren of stygia capital city dys the player takes on a mission to champion for one of these gods after each mission you get to choose another task and thus choose to serve a different god for that mission it is however showed in the fourth mission that marduk followed eldred to this world and conspired to destroyed this world his plot started with a cult to tempt the civilians in this world to believe in marduk himself so that he who now is renamed as ashur would save them in the conflicts between the five gods followed by the end of this world in the first six missions if you accomplish some optional objectives or meet a particular target which are hidden from the list of objectives in some maps simply win the game in some others you have to figure that out a god will offer you a boon upon the victory of the game be the god the one who gave you the mission or another one involved in the game ranging from increasing health mana or speed to increasing magic resistance physical resistance health or mana regeneration of your wizard the player fights through a total of nine missions each one rewarding you with new creatures and spells with the tenth and final mission taking place in the present and being the final showdown between eldred and marduk minions these are the various creatures available to each deity persephone s faithful druid druids fight with bare hands and therefore do less damage than most basic melee minions of other god but they often survive much longer because of their special ability life shield which make enemies do half damage to the druids ranger rangers are the basic shooters of persephone s mystics they have quite a long range and have the ability divine sight which summons a floating eye to scout around shrike shrikes do sonic attacks and can stun the enemy wizard and interrupt their actions like the druids they have life shield ability scarab scarabs are an auxiliary creature although they cannot attack they shoot out a beam which heals friendly units troll trolls are an advanced melee unit which deal more damage and have more hitpoints than druids they also regenerate quickly gnome gnomes possessing a very advanced culture use their handcannons to shoot down their enemies and rarely miss an albino gnome hero named thestor is an opponent in the first persephone mission but if spared he will fight for you for all of the other missions gremlin gremlins fly fast and can use their ability to snare a hostile unit lift it up and teach him a good lesson mutant this malformed creature is infected with a horrific disease which culminates in the growth of polyps filled with disease pathogens in battle mutants pluck these polyps from their bodies and hurl them at the foe possessing the longest range of all persephone s creatures mutants also release a burst of healing energy that affects all nearby friendlies when slain ent persephone s powerful creature the ent is a slow moving but tough and powerful melee unit with the ability to generate a lifeshield around all nearby friendlies via its protector special ability there is an ent hero named toldor who becomes available to persephone followers in the later missions of the game dragon the titan of persephone s forces the dragon is a flying unit with the special ability breath of life which effectively mimics the charnel spell animate dead the dragon hero sirocco is available to james followers from the second mission pyro s proles cog these primitive steam driven robots bludgeon their foes with metal hammers and explode in bursts of searing steam when slain flame minion these creatures spit fire balls and can escape fast using run away when the situation go worse spitfire spitfires are large orange flyers they shoot out cones of fires and do area damage but they are very fragile especially before enemy shooters they work incredibly well in groups and not so well on their own tickferno tickfernos are red beetle like creatures that can shoot a heat ray which drains their victim s mana to none but the beam moves slowly and can easily be dodged firefist firefists are trolls that were captured and experimented on by pyro their fiery fists punch harder when they are low on health pyromaniac these pyro worshipping gnomes shoot fiery darts from their rocket launchers that set their targets alight the first pyromaniac the hero faestus is available to pyro followers at the first level and then rejoins them from the fourth level onwards the treacherous faestus will also side with others to save his own skin so he also becomes available to charnel james and persephone followers when they assault helios levels 7 6 and 8 respectively pyrodactyl these fragile bat like creatures can spit out viscous oil that disables anyone in an area from receiving commands and will ignite when struck by a fire spell or fire based attack from certain creatures bombard bombards were once mountain living lummox which makes them the cousins of the flummox and the flurry they are very slow but deadly they throw burning spheres which burn a large area warmonger the creature with highest damage warmonger with their machine gun can attack a small area they are short range and extremely fragile but they can do enormous damage before they die they also have firewalk which allows them to instantly transport a short distance phoenix although not the strongest ultimate creature phoenix often perform better than many others because of their mana burning beam they will also cast a fire shield upon themselves when hit by melee attack james s yeomen trogg the toughest among all basic melee units troggs are slow and have resistant skin which protect them from magical damage though non damaging spells freeze grasping vines slime etc still affect them the ideal unit when going up against one of pyro s superweapons or wizards earthfling these shooters inflict more damage than troggs they can also turn themselves to stone which increase their regeneration rate and defense but disables them rendering them unable to do anything beside standing still gargoyle james spitfire gargoyles are more durable than spitfires they cast down a rain of stones to smash anything below them basilisk like scarabs they do not attack instead they can petrify enemies with their gaze taurock stronger than the troggs taurock are nothing but a tanker and manalith siege weapon when their health goes low they increase their defense flummox very slow and not very accurate a flummox throws out stone boulders to shake the ground and can interrupt an enemy wizard s spell casting ikarus these powerful flyers are similar to pyro s pyrodactyl and charnel s blight as their special ability stickbomb allows them to coat an enemy with sticky glue and thus gum them up an ikarus hero named gammel is available to james followers from the first mission boulderdash boulderdash are more accurate than other area damage shooters as their projectile splits into three and can attack three targets at one time jabberocky a jabberocky walks painfully slow but tanks better than taurocks they can also make a tiny quake and interrupt an enemy wizard s spells rhinok the sole ultimate creature who stands rather than flies they are arguably the most powerful ultimate creature in the hand of grandmasters rhinok sends waves of spikes out through the ground in all directions and it can summon a halo of earth to shoot down nearby hostile flyers stratos servants frostwolf very fast yet very fragile these frostwolfs are formerly known as persephone s slaves of the circle of life their ability run away which makes them run faster is frequently used to assault manaliths or ranged units rather than run away sylph a deadly accurate shooter their ability stealth which they use to turn themselves invisible makes them good for ambushes or for tracking enemies brainiac brainiac use their psychic power to stun enemy wizard and interrupt their spellcasting his attack is often considered as the most effective among the basic stratos units but he is very fragile a brainiac hero sara bella is available in the first and the sixth stratos missions charnel followers will also find her fluttering about in shock on a mountain in the final charnel mission vortick a white tick which makes a tiny cyclone to interrupt enemies or even fall down the cliff its name and its attack resembles vortex squall a ground shooter they shoot out an air beam which drives their victims back they can deal with slow melee units perfectly storm giant a strong and fast melee unit which become stronger when struck by lightning his ability call lightning is to release his hidden power lord surtur a storm giant hero is available in the second persephone mission as well as the second and third stratos missions seraph the fastest of all flyers and a relative of the gremlin the seraph can use a cage to catch an enemy but she isn t powerful flurry a weird area damage shooter their projectile causes the area to implode sucking everything nearby towards the impact point very good at stunning enemies but can also disable your melee units on the front line yeti a powerful melee unit which freezes their victims with their attack their enemies will be driven mad by its freezing fist silverback the most frequently used ultimate creature they fly fast their breath freezes their enemies and they posses run away yet they are very dependent on mana and are very easy to handle with phoenixes charnel s minions scythe though not so aggressive as the cog the scythe s attack replenishes its life and makes him a perfect basic melee unit they can survive a long time and deal much damage a scythe hero called gangrel is available at the first mission for the necromancers and he will be possessed by astaroth the demon lord in the ritual of charnel in front of the demon gate in the fifth charnel mission fallen fallen shoot out flies swarm which slightly slow down their enemy they can also play dead to increase their regeneration rate again their attack replenishes their life locust a fragile flyer who is perfect to finish off the enemy wizard they can run after him perfectly and steal his life as well as mana by its attack necryl necryls are very annoying yet not useful on their own they spit diseased bile which stops victims from regenerating health and mana when killed they spread out diseases to infect those around them blight a flyer who is very good at annoying enemies by assaulting manalith with guerilla tactics they can also spew blightmites to slow down their enemies netherfiend a melee unit which is good at defense they become permanently tougher by consuming blue souls deadeye deadeyes are summoned on the corpses of gnomes they are shooters with a surprisingly long range their projectiles are deadly accurate and poisonous abomination using a modified version of the mutant sprite the abomination is almost exactly like the mutant being one of charnel s long range units unlike the mutant the abomination does not release healing energy when slain while the mutant is more accurate the abomination s projectiles which consist of chunks of necrotic entrail and congealed masses of blood leave a trail of corrosive droplets behind them as they arc through the air which means they damage all enemies between the abomination and its target the gruesome nature of the abomination s projectiles means that each shot leaves a streamer of blood and the ground and a splash of gore where it hits multiple abominations attacking an area can leave the ground totally covered with gore styx looking similar to warmonger styx channels dark energy and cause explosions to attack its foe they can also explode a blue soul to heavily damage all nearby units hellmouth hellmouth are a flying shooter which shoot out poisonous projectiles they are not very deadly but are very tough and can tank quite well others manahoar a unit that every wizard needs they draw the energy from your manaliths and replenish your mana sac doctor you can t control it but they are useful they are used to carry the red souls to the altar for conversion and desecrate your enemy s altar villagers these are the helpless unarmed people who inhabit this world they appear as peasants farmers snowmen slaves or zombies within different god s boundary you will get a single red soul by killing them which you can then convert spells for each god persephone s mysticism consisting almost entirely of healing and support spells the mysticism of persephone is used to bolster your forces so a mystic needs souls more than any other wizard wrath like all initial spells wrath is a simple offensive spell the wizard conjures a globe of blue green energy and hurls it at the target ethereal form each of the second level spells in sacrifice is a defensive spell for the player ethereal form is the shortest in duration but the most useful in application it effectively turns the caster ethereal making them immune to any physical and magical attack grasping vines grasping vines entangles a target and prevent it from movement but the target can still attack or cast spells rainbow an upgraded form of the heal spell that hits the initial target and then bounces away to heal four more of your units rain of frogs causes frogs formed of magical energy to start falling from the sky over the targeted area these frogs chase all nearby units both friends and foes and cling to them slowing them down for a while before exploding they inflict little damage individually but a concentrated barrage can destroy just about any ground based unit healing aura causes the targeted creature to radiate an aura that heals all nearby friendlies vinewall creates a barrier of vines to shoot up from the earth any enemy that gets near the wall is entangled meanstalks causes giant vines to erupt from the soil these vines impale any creature that gets near them and then flings it high into the air the initial spiking causes some damage the impact causes more ultimately however it is only a distraction and or way of slowing the enemy down charm permanently converts the target creature into one of your minions pyro s sorcery as would be expected pyro s magic is all about fire and flames known as sorcery pyro s sorcerers have the greatest amount of offensive power in the game there is no pyro spell that cannot be made to deal damage fireball simple direct and effective generate a large ball of flames and molten rock and then hurl it at the foe it explodes when hit and damages a very tiny area roughly about the size of two level 1 creatures close to each other fireform engulfs the caster in a shield of flames which effectively sets any nearby hostile unit on fire as well as lowering damage inflicted insignificantly rings of fire like all third level spells rings of fire hinders the victim s movement causing it to slow down a little unlike the other third level spells rings of fire actually causes damage while it lasts dragonfire creates a dragon shape of flames which flies at a target then flies up into the air before making two further air strikes whilst it only targets three individual units it burns anything caught in its path explosion creates a ring of fireballs around the target point which swell up and then explode this inflicts fire damage but also sends anything caught in the area of effect hurtling through the air if cast near a chasm it s possible to send creatures flying into the chasm firewall creates a wall of flames that burns anything that comes through it as slowing them down during the process of passing through rain of fire as the name suggests creates a storm of fiery meteors over the target area very good at killing off guardians blind rage drives one creature into a blinding fury which causes them to attack the nearest unit be ita friend or foe with their melee attacks units which do ranged attacks deal less damage therefore volcano the spell for mass destruction creates a volcanic eruption the central area will burst out hot magma which does a lot of damage and kill the toughest creatures within seconds this area is however quite small but the volcano also hurls out deadly volcanic bombs which also does drastic damage james s geomancy since he is the god of earth james specializes in geomancy and therefore has mostly earth related spells which are specialised to defend and bolster the endurance of your james yeomen rock the most simple attack spell rips a giant boulder from the earth and sends it flying towards the target james and stratos share the dubious honour of being the only two gods in the game whose initial spells can hit your minions if they get between your spell and the target skin of stone the caster becomes encased in a flexible but durable layer of rock soul mole summons some unknown form of burrowing creature which sweeps towards the target soul of a dead minion and then carries it back towards the caster knocking down any enemy in its path be cautious when using this spell as once the mole grabs the soul it counts as a gib soul aka it s available to any wizard this spell is less likely to be used then its stratos counterpart soul wind due simply to the fact that james creatures are tougher and have more health than stratos creatures soul mole can also only pick up souls while soul wind can also do a decent amount of damage to anything en route this spell has the most extensive range in the game however and can be quite handy to collect souls far away from the wizard erupt the earth at the target point rises up and then slams down hurling any nearby creature through the air and stunning them it causes a little damage when they hit the ground and it can fling creatures into chasms but it s more useful for disrupting a tightly clustered group of enemies halo of earth this causes several boulders to rip themselves from the earth and hover above the caster s head they automatically fire themselves at any enemy that gets near they do damage equivalent to the rock spell wall of spikes creates a line of stalagmites that slow and wound anything that moves through them bombardment causes a massive shower of boulders to rip from the ground and then slam into the targeted area like mortars the sheer power of this spell can pound the targeted area into a crater bovine intervention most likely a reference to earthworm jim s infamous cow joke this spell causes a giant cow to rocket out of the sky and land on your target it shakes the ground when it hits hurting nearby enemies and stunning them and the initial target is gibbed and instantly release blue souls bore a massive chunk of earth roughly the size of an altar is carved away in a spiral shape any land enemy caught in the spiral counts as having fallen into a chasm the melted area restores itself over several seconds stratos elementalism stratos s repertoire consists mainly of lightning and wind spells and is very well balanced his slightly weaker than most spells recharge incredibly fast so you always have a mid level spell ready lightning simple and direct this spell creates a lightning bolt that arcs from your hands to zap the target unlike all of the other spells lightning does not track its target but simply hits the first thing directly between you and the target including allies obstacles and the ground itself however it costs less mana than any other spell in the game and recharges incredibly fast air shield creates a swirling vortex around you to reduce damage and push any enemy back when they approach you freeze the least useful of all immobilizing spells a frozen target thaws out instantly if attacked its sole saving value is its quick speed to be cast making it very useful for disrupting enemy spellcasters try using it when an enemy flying creature is over a hole and get rid of them for good chain lightning slightly weaker in damage than lightning chain lightning makes up for it and the fact it has a longer casting time and prevents movement whilst being cast with the fact that it bounces from the initial target to strike anything nearby soul wind creates a mini cyclone that zooms to a targeted blue soul and snares it blasting any nearby enemies with lightning bolts along the way dealing damage roughly equivalent to lightning unlike lightning it also knocks them over for a bit usable while moving frozen ground the wizard hurls a freezing mass of ice and cause an area of ground to be covered by a plate of ice freezing any unit caught in it the ice plate eventually shatters causing damage to any unit within its area its long casting time limits its effect as the targets often go away the area before the ice hits this is unique in being the highest level spell you can cast while moving about fence this wall spell creates a line of transparent globes that electrify anything that comes near them the damage dealt is the highest among all wall spells but this is balanced by the fact that this spell is one level higher than the others cloudkill creates a small black storm cloud that rains down a random shower of powerful lightning bolts these bolts are attracted to units and wizards but can and will strike randomly if there is a unit within range if targeted at a specific unit the cloud slowly moves to follow the target otherwise it will be fixed at the point it was cast great for killing guardians tornado creates a powerful tornado that sucks up any unit and whirls it high into the air before letting it drop it lasts quite a long time and can effectively disrupt the targets for quite some time charnel s necromancy charnel s spells are stereotypical black magic relating to death demons decay and pain a wizard of charnel is a necromancer and charnel s lore is called necromancy while not outright devastating charnel s magic can still be lethal if used with an amount of subtlety and tactics insect swarm this basic spell conjures a ravenous swarm of flesh eating insects and sets them upon a target healing the caster by the amount of damage inflicted protective swarm identical to insect swarm but the insects swarm around the caster instead shielding him from damage and replenish health slime drenches the target in thick gooey sludge that slows them down and makes them more susceptible to damage and less capable of inflicting it this can also slow down spell casting if the spell is started channeling before the slime is hurled animate dead the most useful of all charnel s spells this spell targets the blue soul of a slain minion and brings it back to life whatsmore it recovers at the same speed as a non cast spell and only costs 300 mana enabling it to be used repeatedly and with devastating effect in fact an army of nothing but locusts for the first half of charnel s campaign or abominations for the second half in conjunction with the animate dead spell is a very nearly unbeatable strategy demonic rift this summons demons in the form of pink energy bolts that leap from the portal on the ground and strike an enemy inflicting damage one demon is summoned for each nearby enemy and the demons inflict sufficient power to instantly slay a 1st level non melee minion wailing wall creates an ethereal barrier of screaming faces that saps mana very quickly from anything that gets too near it plague creates a black stormcloud which proceeds to rain diseased blood over the affected area all creatures within or entering the area of effect are diseased losing health steadily and faster if they continue to be hit by the bloody rain and suffering increased susceptibility to damage and decreased ability to inflict damage plague can be a fairly effective guardian killer but lacks rain of fire s strength intestinal vaporization causes a target to swell up and burst resulting in a gib death summons a giant spirit creature with scythe blades for hands that attacks all nearby creatures one strike with its blades instantly slays any creature it does not attack wizards sac doctors or structures neutral spells neutral spells are available to all five gods champions speed up a self explanatory spell it boosts your minions walking speed heal another self explanatory spell that heals a friendly target manalith this spell create a manalith on a mana fountain that replenishes your mana teleport instantly transport yourself and your minions nearby to your own altar or manalith when an enemy wizard is about to take over your altar use this convert this spell summons a sac doctor which you cannot control to transport a red hostile soul to your altar and purify it into a friendly one to use shrine a spell that is only available to wizards at level three or above this summons a shrine on a mana fountain that can act like a limited version of an altar your sac doctor can convert red souls here and increase your mana regeneration rate when you get nearby roughly by the speed of an atlar your manahoars cannot draw energy from shrines however guardian this spell create a spirit link to one of your creature with your manaliths shrines or altar and greatly increase its strength to protect it the guardians cannot go very far from the structure it guards and the structure can only be destroyed when all guardians are cleared when the structure is under attack the guardians will incur any damage the structure would otherwise take desecrate a spell to banish the wizard

from the ansmet project like other members of the group of sncs shergottite nakhlite chassignite alh 84001 is thought to be from mars on discovery its mass was 1 93 kg history this rock is theorized to be one of the oldest pieces of the solar system proposed to have crystallized from molten rock 4 5 billion years ago based on hypotheses surrounding attempts to identify from whence extraterrestrial rocks come it is supposed to have originated on mars and is related to other martian meteorites the theory holds that it was shocked and broken by one or more meteorite impacts on the surface of mars some 3 6 billion years ago but remained on the planet it was later blasted off from the surface in a separate impact about 15 million years ago following some interplanetary travel impacted earth roughly 13 000 years ago these dates were established by a variety of radiometric dating techniques including samarium neodymium sm nd rubidium strontium rb sr potassium argon k ar and carbon 14 possible lifeforms on august 6 1996 alh 84001 became newsworthy when it was announced that it was believed that the meteorite contained traces of life from mars as published in an article in science by dr david mckay of nasa under the scanning electron microscope structures were revealed that for some time were considered to be the remains in the form of fossils of bacteria like lifeforms the structures found on alh 84001 are 20 100 nanometres in diameter similar in size to the theoretical nanobacteria but smaller than any proven cellular life if the structures are really fossilized lifeforms they would be the first solid evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life aside from the chance of their origin being terrestrial contamination the announcement of possible extraterrestrial life caused considerable controversy at the time and opened up interest in martian exploration when the discovery was announced many immediately conjectured that the fossils were the first true evidence of extraterrestrial life making headlines around the world and even prompting u s president bill clinton to make a formal televised announcement to mark the event several tests for organic material have been performed on the meteorite and amino acids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah have been found the debate if the organic molecules were created by nonbiological processes or are due to contamination from the contact with antarctic ice is still on going as of 2006 however most experts agree that the microfossils are not indicative of life but of contamination by earthly biofilms it has not yet conclusively been shown how the features were formed but similar features have been recreated in labs without biological inputs according to the associated press skeptics have found non biological explanations for every piece of evidence that was presented on aug 6 1996 and though they still vigorously defend their claim the nasa scientists who advanced it now stand alone in their belief recent studies on alh 84001 have shown that although chances are low eventually martian rocks such as alh 84001 could actually transfer martian life to earth 1 in 10 million meteorites from mars arrives in less than a year and around 10 rocks that weigh more than 100 grams make the journey in 2 3 years bacterial spores and rock dwelling organisms are speculated to survive in space for 5 years meaning transfer of martian life to our planet is entirely possible survival and propagation after arriving though would be even less likely its native environment is completely unlike anywhere it would land on earth as if a deep sea fish suddenly arrived in the middle of the sahara desert mars has an atmosphere many times thinner than that on top of mount everest with almost no oxygen or water a life form evolved to survive in such conditions would almost invariably find oxygen water and dense air to be toxic as it would the relatively high temperatures even the antarctic does not get as cold as much of mars does much of the year however it is hypothesized that alh 84001 originated from a time period during which water may have existed on mars other meteorites that have what may be biological markings have generated less interest because they do not originate from a wet mars alh 84001 is the only meteorite collected from such a time period origin on mars in september 2005 vicky hamilton of the university of hawaii at manoa presented an analysis of the origin of alh 84001 using data from the mars global surveyor and mars odyssey spacecraft orbiting mars according to the analysis eos chasma in the valles marineris canyon appears to be the source of the meteorite the analysis was not conclusive in part because it was limited to parts of mars not obscured by dust alh 84001 in fiction deception point a novel by dan brown refers to the alh 84001 meteorite in its central theme contact a 1997 film adaptation of the novel by carl sagan

running between 18th century bc and 13th century bc canaan was an egyptian vassal state and thus 14th century documents from the el amarna archive in egypt describe hazor s king at the time abdi tirshi as swearing loyalty to the egyptian pharaoh in these documents hazor is described as an important city in canaan hazor is also mentioned in 18th century bce documents found in mari on the tigris river according to the book of joshua hazor was the seat of jabin a powerful caananite king that lead a canaanite confederation against joshua but was defeated by joshua who burnt hazor to the ground according to the book of judges hazor was the seat of jabin the king of caanan whose commander sisera lead a canaanite army against barak but was ultimately defeated textual scholars believe that the prose account of barak which differs from the poetic account in the song of deborah is a conflation of accounts of two separate events one concerning barak and sisera like the poetic account the other concerning jabin s confederation and defeat in addition textual scholars think that the book of judges and book of joshua are parallel accounts referring to the same events rather than describing different time periods and thus that they refer to the same jabin a powerful king based in hazor whose canaanite confederation was defeated by an israelite army an increasing majority of archaeologists believe that the israelites emerged simply as a subculture within canaanite society and thus that the israelite conquest of canaan didn t actually happen most biblical scholars believe that the book of joshua conflates several independent battles between disparate groups over multiple centuries and artificially attributes them to a single leader joshua nevertheless one archaeological stratum dating from around 1200bc shows signs of catastrophic fire and cuneiform tablets found at the site refer to monarchs named ibni which may be the etymological origin of jabin the city also show signs of having been a magnificent canaanite city prior to its destruction with great temples and opulent palaces split into an upper acropolis and lower city the town evidently had been a major canaanite city however the cuneiform tablets mentioning ibni date from the middle bronze 2000 1550bc age much earlier than the destruction layer which itself differs substantially in date from the late bronze age destructions of aphek lachish and megiddo thus these cities cannot have been destroyed by a single army lead by a single individual in a single campaign as the book of joshua would have it due to the time period involved archaeologists suspect that the real reason for the destruction of hazor could simply be civil strife attacks by the sea peoples and or a result of the general collapse of civilisation across the whole eastern mediterranean in the late bronze age israelite hazor the archaeological remains suggest that some time after its destruction the city of hazor was rebuilt as minor village according to the books of kings the town along with megiddo and gezer was later substantially fortified and expanded by solomon like those at megiddo and gezer the remains at hazor show that during the early iron age the town gained a highly distinctive six chambered gate as well as a characteristic style to its administration buildings archaeologists have become convinced that these constructions at hazor were built by the same leadership as those at megiddo and gezer by reference to the books of kings archaeologists initially concluded that these remains verified the biblical claims that they were constructed on the orders of solomon though this has since been criticised as determining history by ideology rather than by the facts on the ground more recent analysis of the architectural style and pottery features in the archaeological levels associated with the six chambered gates and administration buildings at these three sites indicates that these structures actually date to the early 9th century bc during the reign of the omrides rather than solomon refined carbon dating technology has also dated the structures to this later date archaeologists have proposed that due to religious prejudice by the biblical authors against the omrides who were polytheist the great achievements of the omrides were instead ascribed to a mythical or semi mythical solomon yigael yadin one of the earliest archaeologists to have worked on the site saw certain features as clearly being omride megiddo gezer and hazor all feature deep rock cut pits from the base of which were rock cut tunnels leading to a well that reached the water table as water supply systems which yadin attributed to the rule of ahab yadin also attributed to ahab a citadel measuring 25 x 21 m with two meter thick walls which was erected in the western part of hazor however yadin s dating was based on the assumption that the layer connected with the gates and administration buildings were built by solomon and thus most archaeologists now date the citadel and rock cut water system much later archaeological remains indicate that towards the later half of the 9th century bc when the king of israel was jehu hazor fell into the control of aram damascus most archaeologists suspect that subsequent to this conquest unmentioned by the bible was a sustained period of occupation by the aramaean forces the remains indicate that hazor was rebuilt shortly after its conquest by aram probably as an aramaean city when the assyrians later defeated the aramaeans hazor seemingly returned to israelite control assyrian records indicate that joash the king of israel at the time had paid tribute to assyria and israel had become an assyrian vassal subsequently the town along with the remainder of the kingdom of israel entered a period of great prosperity particularly during the rule of jeroboam ii most archaeologists now attribute the later large scale constructions at hazor megiddo and gezer including the rock cut water supply systems to this era israel s attempted rebellion against assyrian domination resulted in an invasion by the forces of the assyrian ruler tiglath pileser iii the evidence on the ground suggests that hasty attempts were made to reinforce the defences of hazor despite the defences in 732 bc hazor was captured its population deported and the city was burnt to the ground citations and notes the james a de rothschild expedition at hazor an account of the second season of excavation 1956 y yadin et al editors the james a de

producer from wisconsin his career spanned 1964 to 1983 boettcher was one of the most important personalities of sunshine pop in the 1960s even influencing brian wilson before the production of pet sounds boettcher worked with the association gary usher the millennium sagittarius and the beach boys among others curt boettcher sang some background vocals on the byrds the notorious byrd brothers album a gary usher production job he started out working with a folk quartet in the early 60s called the goldebriars two albums were released by epic records and a third which apparently found them heading in a prototypical folk rock direction was recorded but was rejected for release the group had added drummer ron edgar prior to recording their third album who would later join the music machine before working with boettcher again in the millennium see lee mallory following the demise of the goldebriars boettcher moved into production and songwriting work for others including tommy roe and the association as well as forming a group called the ballroom though the group signed to warner bros and recorded an album in 1966 it remained unreleased in its entirety until 2001 however boettcher met both brian wilson and producer gary usher while working on the album usher in particular was so impressed that when working on an album for a studio project released under the name of sagittarius he called in boettcher to contribute several of his songs from the ballroom album which were basically the recordings that boettcher had originally produced albeit with a stereo mix gary usher s clout as well as his successful productions for the association and tommy roe allowed boettcher to start working on his own studio project for columbia records in 1968 having been given carte blanche he assembled a group of musicians and songwriters that he knew including sandy salisbury lee mallory joey stec and michael fennelly as well as a flank of top los angeles session men and started recording an album under the group moniker the millennium their only album begin was the most expensive album that columbia had released at that point and despite the release of several singles it was a commercial failure this has been partially attributed to boettcher s reluctance to tour the group did attempt a few live performances in los angeles but the difficulty of reasonably replicating the album on stage presented a large enough challenge to disinterest boettcher and though the single it s you did become a substantial hit in several regions there was no group to support it surprisingly enough 5 am also became a hit as well in the philippines though the lack of success for the album took a heavy toll upon the group they did release one final single just about the same b w blight they also recorded several songs for a follow up album though the album was never completed soon after the millennium broke up boettcher s friend gary usher started a record label called together records he brought in boettcher as a staff producer and boettcher was involved in several projects for the label these included his first attempt at a solo album as well as producing recordings for a sandy salisbury solo album an instrumental treatment of brian wilson compositions for a small orchestra and contributing to the second sagittarius album though the sagittarius album entitled the blue marble did see release and also notched a minor entry on the singles chart with a cover of the beach boys in my room and several sandy salisbury singles were released the label folded before any of his other work could be completed though it was eventually released in the early 2000s following this and without having a substantial hit in any form for several years boettcher s career started to stall in 1971 he signed a deal with elektra records at the insistence of jac holzman who was a huge fan of begin even after telling holzman that the album would take a long time to produce holzman still insisted and boettcher reluctantly started working on a solo album his influence was soon bolstered after meeting a young multi instrumentalist named webb burrel and taking a cue from the early entirely solo albums by emitt rhodes boettcher decided to record the album in a similar fashion using as few musicians as possible after almost two years of work there s an innocent face was finally released in 1973 it differed from his early work though as posthumous collections show it was a continuation of the direction that the millennium had taken with their unreleased recordings as it was a collection of songs with country sunshine pop arena rock and folk stylings despite its eclectic nature it was another commercial failure he did attempt to record a follow up album tentatively titled chicken little was right but it was never completed his output both as a musician and producer was severely curtailed afterwards and he did very little work during the last years of his life his best known if not highly regarded work following there s an innocent face is a 10 minute disco version of the song here comes the night by the beach boys which was a moderate hit in 1979 and was included on l a light album though it is generally considered to be vastly inferior to the original recording from their 1967 album wild honey he also produced mike love s solo album looking back with love which many beach boys fans regard as the worst album ever associated with the group unfortunately he never had the opportunity to revive his career and he died in 1987 following a lung operation critical opinion of boettcher s work and importance varies as some find his work outside of the millennium to be rather lightweight and aloof arguing that the technical quality of his productions and arrangements are often offset by subpar material style versus substance gary usher however maintained until his dying day that boettcher was light years beyond brian wilson as a producer though this is certainly open to debate in spite of all of this his output has achieved a substantial cult following particularly amongst sunshine pop aficionados and in countries where sunshine pop is popular such as japan and the millennium s begin is generally regarded nowadays as one of the finest pop albums from the late 60s discography there s an innocent face 1973 elektra

 id=501260 title referee football nonfiltered 215 processed 211 dbindex 1560216 a referee presides over a game of association football soccer the referee has full authority to enforce the laws of the game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed law 5 and the referee s decisions regarding facts connected with play are final so far as the result of the game is concerned the referee is assisted by two assistant referees formerly known as linesmen and in some matches also by a fourth official the match officials utilise a positioning system known as the diagonal system of control the vast majority of referees are amateur though they are usually paid a small fee and or expenses for their services however in some countries a limited number of referees who mainly officiate in their country s top division are employed full time by their national associations and receive a retainer at the start of every season plus match fees referees officiating adult competitive international games are required to be selected from the fifa panel of referees this restriction does not necessarily apply to non competitive so called friendly games or youth games powers and duties the referee s powers and duties are described by law 5 of the laws of the game these include enforcing the laws of the game controlling the match in co operation with the assistant referees and where applicable with the fourth official ensuring that any ball used meets the requirements of law 2 ensuring that the players equipment meets the requirements of law 4 acting as timekeeper and keeping a record of the match stopping suspending or terminating the match at his discretion for any infringements of the laws stopping suspending or terminating the match because of outside interference of any kind stopping the match if in his opinion a player is seriously injured and ensuring that he is removed from the field of play an injured player may only return to the field of play after the match has restarted allowing play to continue until the ball is out of play if a player is in his opinion only slightly injured history the term referee originated in association football originally the team captains would consult with each other in order to resolve any dispute on the pitch eventually this role was delegated to an umpire each team would bring their own partisan umpire allowing the team captains to concentrate on the game the umpire could not run onto the field and interfere with the game but could be appealed to by the players in order to solve disputes umpires were given the right to award a free kick for handball in 1873 and for other offences in 1874 later that year umpires were given the right to send off a player for persistent infringement of the rules by 1880 the need for a neutral observer was evident and the referee a third official was added the referee would be referred to if the umpires could not resolve a dispute the duties of the referee expanded as they were now responsible for keeping a record of the game and timekeeping for the first time referees were permitted to caution or send off players for unsporting behaviour or violent conduct without consulting the umpire the referee did not take his place on the pitch until 1891 at this time they were allowed to award free kicks for fouls without an appeal then umpires became linesmen officially called assistant referees since 1996 today in many amateur football matches each side will still supply their own partisan linesman to assist the neutral referee appointed by the governing football association this is usually due to a lack of available referees non sanctioned assistants are permitted to signal when the ball leaves the field but are not allowed to call fouls or possession whistle use referees use a whistle to indicate the commencement of play to stop play due to an infringement or other reason to indicate half time and full time and as an adjunct to verbal communication in other situations although the use of whistles is not mandated by the laws of the game before the introduction of the whistle referees indicated their decisions by waving a handkerchief the whistles that were first adopted by referees were made by joseph hudson of the acme whistle company who first began to mass produce whistles in the 1870s for the metropolitan police service it is frequently stated the referee s whistle was first used in a game between nottingham forest and sheffield norfolk in 1878 however no such fixture is known to have taken place between the two clubs in that year uniform modern day referees and their assistants wear a uniform comprised of a jersey shorts and socks until the 1950s it was more common for a referee to wear a blazer than a jersey traditionally that uniform was almost always all black unless one of the teams was wearing a very dark jersey in which case the referee would wear another colour of jersey usually red to distinguish himself from both teams at the 1994 world cup finals new jerseys were introduced that gave officials a choice of burgundy yellow or white and at the same time the creation of the fa premier league in england saw referees wear green jerseys both changes were motivated by television considerations since then most referees have worn either yellow or black but the colours and styles adopted by individual associations vary greatly for international contests under the supervision of fifa adidas uniforms are worn because adidas is the current sponsor see also

the founder of the kansas city times he was born in warren county virginia childhood as a child edwards learned type setting in the town of front royal virginia in the gazette office for the sentinel at the age of fourteen years old testifies a contemporary he has produced a story that gave him wide celebrity while still a boy he was induced to come to the state of missouri in either 1854 or 1855 on his arriaval in lexington missouri edwards soon entered upon his profession as a printer in the office of the expositor being quite a shy boy he loved solitude something that would continue through out his life soldier in the year 1862 gen jo shelby organized a regiment near waverly lafayette county missouri assisting the command of this regiment was lieutenant colonel frank gordon colonels shanks and beal g jeans and captain ben elliott this command moved on the day of the lone jack fight with a view of forming a junction with cockrell and coffee the forces of shanks jeans and elliott with his own regiment constituted the original force under shelby of this command after the expiration of several months upon the retirement of captain arthur john n edwards received the appointment of brigade adjutant with the rank of major this occurred in the month of september 1863 when finally shelby was promoted to the command of a division edwards shared the fortune of his generous and chivalrous leader and became the adjutant of the division i think with the rank of colonel though of this i have no positive evidence at hand in this position he continued until the disbanding of the whole command after lee s surrender in mexico after the close of the war major edwards together with other soldiers followed his leader to mexico where he spent two years during the time of maximilian s empire with this amiable but unfortunate prince and with his wife the poor carlotta he became a favorite and through him was negotiated and obtained the grant which enabled shelby and perhaps fifty others to establish the cordova colony of carlotta he and governor allen of louisiana a man of beautiful spirit and richly stored mind established a newspaper the mexican times devoted to the restoration of an era of peace prosperity and good government for this sadly distracted people whilst here the material of one of his books an unwritten leaf of the war was produced and gathered which appears in this present volume what a strangely romantic period these two years must have been to the dreamy poetic soldier of the north the rich tropical foliage the skies luminously blue the warm airs the voluptuous climate the romantic people inheriting the glorious traditions of old spain the memories of the cid songs of calderon and lope de vega chanted in the sweet the castilian tongue must have been things of ceaseless charm to the imaginative temperament so strongly marked in major edwards it was a period of romantic adventure and from time to time he has related to me singular episodes that occurred during his association with governor allen but brevity denies indulgence to the reminiscent mood in the year 1867 having returned from mexico major edwards went on the republican as a reporter then under the editorial control of col william hyde a noble gentleman and an able writer whose contributions to that great paper have rarely been equaled in western journalism in the year 1868 in connection with the brilliant and versatile cola john c moore now of the pueblo dispatch he inaugurated the kansas city times with the financial support of r b drury co it was at this time that he was married this marriage took place on march 28 1871 to mary virginia plattenburg of dover lafayette county missouri a woman scarce less brilliant than himself of high impulses poetic sentiment and of an uncommon literary faculty she was a fit companion for this molder of fiery and delectable shapes they were married at the residence of gen john o shelby near aullville in lafayette county this marriage took place away from the home of the bride because of an interposed objection on the part of the parents grounded solely upon the near family relationship of the parties the fruit of this marriage is two boys and one girl the boys are john aged seventeen and james fourteen years the girl laura eight major edwards remained on the times until 1873 two years after it passed into its present management and greatly aided in building it up into its present commanding position as director of western thought and enterprise in this same year he went upon the st louis dispatch owned and controlled by mr stilson hutchins whom he followed into the st louis times it was while at work on the times that his duel with col emory s foster took place the difficulty grew out of certain questions incident to the great civil struggle whose memories were yet fresh in the minds of all and its passions still unallayed these matters were discussed with great acerbity of temper and sharpness of expression the acrimony engendered by a long bitter contest was still more or less dominant in the minds of men in all sections it can serve no good purpose here to dwell on the questions themselves or their mode of treatment they belong to the dead past and there let them remain i know that the acrimony so rife at the time of this occurrence with major edwards in common with the better class of men in both sections was a thing to be deplored and forgotten the friends and admirers of major edwards are of all parties there are no more tender or appreciative tributes to his memory than those written by the men in blue mrs edwards informs me that she has received as many expressions of sympathy and admiration from federal as from confederate soldiers the perpetuation of the rancor of the war is left to the camp follower and coward i shall here enter on no defense of major edwards ideas on the duello with his education and sensitive perception of the worth of personal honor it is easily accounted for omitting the offensive paragraphs we give this statement from a morning paper the day after the rencounter journalist after his withdrawal from the st louis times he started to santa fe to engage in sheep raising but visiting dover to make his farewells he was dissuaded from the undertaking and remained at the home of his wife s father judge j s plattenburg and wrote the noted guerrillas a wonderful record of the border warfare subsequently he went to sedalia taking editorial charge of the democrat retiring from this paper he started the dispatch which had a brief but singularly brilliant career he was then called to the editorial management of the st joseph gazette by the late col j n burnes the owner of the paper again in 1887 he was recalled to the editorial chair of the kansas city times which place he held at the time of his death one needs but to read the numerous press tributes to know how exceedingly brilliant his editorial career has been his style bright and full of poetic forms was forceful vigorous and convincing as flashing and as keen as the scimitar of saladdin many of the passages in this book bear critical comparison with the most beautiful passages of classic english the exuberance of expression and prodigality of beautiful words in the compositions of major edwards have occasionally led men to overlook or underestimate the more solid aspects of his mind his historical and general knowledge was very great his familiarity with the best specimens of classic english in both prose and poetry was something wonderful in both accuracy and comprehensiveness the opportunities of a student s life were never within his reach and yet he knew vastly more of books than most men who had been patient toilers over their pages through continuous years to the ordinary mind it was wholly inexplicable how or when he obtained such stores of rich and varied knowledge his work was a remarkable blending of fact and fancy of cogent reasoning and vivid poetic expression a rare combination of powers there are many gradgrinds but few poets to clothe the hard facts of life in the aureole of imperishable beauty the words necessary to describe fitly the dauntless courage the greatness of soul the tenderness surpassing that of woman characterizing the life of john edwards would to those who little knew him seem fulsome and extravagant but not so to his friends who knew him some of the virtues of major edwards were so intense in their expression as to seem almost weaknesses he never talked of himself there was not a single shred of the braggart in his nature he was reticent of his own deeds to the verge of eccentricity he seemed to be wholly unambitious free even from a suspicion of egotism a strongly marked instance of this is shown in the fact in three books of which he is the real hero not once is illusion made to himself i fully agree with his devoted friend dr munford that such a repression of self under such circumstances is simply without a parallel i have known but one other man well in missouri who even nearly equaled the modesty the unselfish self forgetfulness of john edwards that man was the prince of orators whose soldiery skill wrote his name beside that of xenophon viz gen a w doniphan for all meretricious methods for every form of pretense for merely dramatic effect john edwards entertained the harshest scorn sham and cant that sniveled stirred his gentle nature into holiest and hottest wrath and he wove around its victim the network of scathing lampoon that burned like the shirt of nessus trickery deceit and cowardice alone made him pitiless that he was unselfish is clearly manifested in this fact that his great influence and surely no single man in all the state had so large a personal following whose devotion was a passion was never employed to advance his own financial interest or to win place for himself his influence was always for his friends the witnesses are everywhere in every walk of life men in high places and low alike bear testimony to his unselfish work for every comer he showed me once a letter from a poor irishman asking his assistance to procure a position on the police force of st louis and it was granted as readily as to a seeker of the highest place and power of his carelessness of self advancement and his unceasing thought of other people this circumstance is recalled he the writer and an old soldier grim and gray in stature a very son of anak stood together these two men had ridden into battle as joyously as the groom seeks his bride and now in the days of peace the grizzled soldier asks john wouldn t you make a good governor promptly the answer came no but i know who would the swart grenadier asks who it is not needful to give the party named beyond this that he represented his district in congress and wore for years stainlessly the judicial ermine of his state i reconsider and give the

 id=219741 title titmouse nonfiltered 245 processed 241 dbindex 1560246 the tits chickadees and titmice family paridae are a large family of small passerine birds which occur in the northern hemisphere and africa most were formerly in the genus parus these birds are called chickadees onomatopoeic derived from their distinctive chick a dee dee dee alarm call or titmice in north america and just tits in the rest of the english speaking world the name titmouse is attested from the 14th century composed of the old english name for the bird mase proto germanic maison and tit denoting something small the spelling was influenced by mouse in the 16th century these birds are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout bills some have crests they are adaptable birds with a mixed diet including seeds and insects many species will live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeders for nuts or seed and learn to take other foods in england great tits and blue tits famously learned to break open the foil caps sealing bottles of milk that had been delivered to homes to get at the cream floating on top these are hole nesting birds laying speckled white eggs systematics more recently the large parus group has been gradually split into several genera as indicated below which has been pioneered by north american ornithological authorities and to a more limited degree as of now elsewhere whereas in the mid 1990s only pseudopodoces baeolophus melanochlora and sylviparus were considered well supported by the available data as distinct from parus harrap quinn 1996 today this arrangement is considered paraphyletic as indicated by mtdna cytochrome b sequence analysis and parus is best restricted to the parus major parus fasciiventer clade and even the latter species closest relatives might be considered a distinct genus gill et al 2005 in the sibley ahlquist taxonomy the paridae family is much enlarged to include related groups such as the penduline tits and long tailed tits but while the former are quite close to the titmice indeed and could conceivably included in that family together with the stenostirid warblers the long tailed tits are not indeed the yellow browed tit and the sultan tit are possibly more distant to the titmice than are the penduline tits gill et al 2005 and jønsson fjeldsa 2006 if the two current families are lumped into the paridae the titmice would be a subfamily parinae alternatively all tits save the 2 monotypic genera discussed in the preceding section and possibly cyanistes but including hume s ground tit could be lumped in parus in any case 4 major clades of typical tits can be recognized the dark capped chickadees and their relatives poecile including sittiparus the long crested baeolophus and lophophanes species the usually tufted white cheeked periparus including pardaliparus with more subdued coloration and finally parus sensu stricto including melaniparus and macholophus still the interrelationship of these as well as the relationships of many species within the clades are not well resolved at all analysis of morphology and biogeography probably gives more a robust picture than the available molecular data gill et al 2005 titmice have settled north america twice probably at some time during the early mid pliocene the first were the ancestors of baeolophus chickadees arrived somewhat later gill et al 2005 family paridae penduline tits and stenostirid warblers might be included here genus sylviparus yellow browed tit sylviparus modestus genus melanochlora sultan tit

 id=8367313 title javanese calendar nonfiltered 254 processed 249 dbindex 1560255 the javanese calendar is a calendar used by the javanese people it was created by sultan agung of mataram in the 17th century c e giving the javanese a calendar that ties in with the islamic calendar and broke with the previously used hindu calendar it officially replaced the earlier use of saka years in 1633 years given in the javanese calendar are sometimes referred to using the latin term anno javanico there are two other calendars in use in java the gregorian calendar and the islamic calendar the gregorian calendar is used for commerce and international communications while the islamic calendar marks days of religious importance in islam the javanese calendar is used for cultural historical and metaphysical purposes there are several systems of designating days but the principal one is tied to the sequence of the lunar calendar used in islam and therefore floats against the gregorian calendar the calendar includes a number of inter related cycles including a pasaran cycle of five days the familiar seven day week mangsa and wulan month long cycles tahun cycles of years and cycles of years in windu coincidences in these cycles have an important numerical and mystical meaning coincidence being an important part of the javanese aesthetic as for example the use of seleh in javanese music cycles of days pasaran cycle the pasaran cycle dates from when villages converged to a marketplace pasar every five days to buy and sell wares itinerant merchants would go to a different village each day of this cycle the days of the cycle were named javanese language politeness with krama in parentheses legi manis pahing pait pon petak wagé cemeng kliwon asih markets are now operational every day but many javanese believe that the pasaran cycle grants certain characteristics to people born under it in some cities traces of this system are visible in the names of market districts for example in surakarta there is pasar legi pasar pon and pasar kliwon which had markets on the given days it also forms part of the wetonan cycle described below seven day week the javanese use a seven day week dina pitu seven days derived from the islamic calendar the names of the days of the week in javanese derived from their arabic counterparts are wetonan cycle the wetonan cycle superimposes the five day pasaran cycle with the seven day week each cycle lasts 35 days and is named using the week day name and the pasaran day name in english either the javanese or the english names of the week can be used to designate a particular weton or specific day in the cycle for example the seven days following senin monday legi are selasa tuesday pahing rebo wednesday pon kemis thursday wagé jumat friday kliwon setu saturday legi minggu sunday pahing and seni monday pon the repetitions of this cycle are regarded similar to months but do not have fixed starting and ending points and are not named in the manner of the month cycles described below this cycle is frequently encountered in divinatory systems and important events are held on propitious days one example is the proclamation of the republic of indonesia on august 17 1945 a friday legi jumat legi sultan agung one of the most famous kings in javanese history was born and died on a friday legi as well friday legi is also an important night of pilgrimage there are also taboos that relate to the cycle for example the ritual dance bedhaya can only be performed on thursday kliwon the pasaran cycle the week cycle and their interlocking in the wetonan cycle each are traditionally thought to give certain characteristics to people born on those days analogous to the planetary positions in western astrology pawukon the pawukon is a 210 day cycle that is related to hindu tradition it is most associated with bali but is also used in java for special purposes the calendar consists of concurrent weeks like the wetonan but has a set of ten different weeks of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 days the first day of the year is the first day of all ten weeks because 210 is not divisible by 4 8 or 9 extra days must be added to the 4 8 and 9 day weeks dates for timekeeping days are numbered within the lunar month wulan as is common in other calendar systems the date indicates the change in the moon and symbolizes the life of a human in the world this process of revolving life is known as cakra manggilingan or heru cakra on the first day of the month when the moon is small it is compared to a newborn baby the 14th day called purnama sidhi full moon represents a married adult the next day called purnama occurs as the moon begins to wane the 20th day panglong symbolizes the point at which people begin to lose their memory the 25th day sumurup represents the point at which the adult requires care like when they were young the 26th day manjing represents the return of the human to his or her origin cycles of months pranata mangsa the solar year is divided into twelve periods mangsa of unequal length its origin lies in agriculture the names of the months are simply the ordinal numbers from 1 to 12 the cycle begins near the summer solstice around the middle of the dry season in java the pranata mangsa can be used to predict personality traits in a similar manner to sun signs in western astrology it is not widely used anymore for divination but some practitioners use it as well as the other cycles in their divination wulan each lunar year tahun is divided into a series of twelve wulan months of 29 or 30 days each this is similar to the use of months in the islamic calendar the names of the month are given below in krama ngoko warana sura 30 days wadana sapar 29 days wijanga mulud 30 days wiyana bakda mulud 29 days widada jumadil awal 30 days widarpa jumadil akhir 29 days wilarpa rejeb 30 days wahana ruwah 29 days wanana pasa 30 days wurana sawal 29 days wujana sela 30 days wujala besar 29 or 30 days depending on the length of the tahun see below the cycle of months is considered metaphorically to represent the cycle of human life the first nine months represent gestation before birth while the tenth month represents the human in the world the eleventh the end of his or her existence and the twelfth the return to where he or she came from the cycle thus goes from one spark or conception rijal to another traversing through the void suwung cycles of years eight tahun makes up a windu a single windu lasts for 81 repetitions of the wetonan cycle or 2 835 days about 7 years 9 months in the gregorian calendar note that the tahun are lunar years and of shorter length than gregorian years the names of the years in the cycle of windu are as follows in krama ngoko purwana alip 354 days karyana ehé 354 days anama jemawal 355 days lalana jé 354 days ngawanga dal 355 days pawaka bé 354 days wasana wawu 354 days swasana jimakir 355 days the windu are then

number of flashback scenes most of them set in 16th century scotland establish the backstory and the characters relationships to one another the immortals the protagonist is connor macleod of the clan macleod the villain is known as the kurgan or in more modern times as victor kruger they and a number of minor characters are immortals humans for whom decapitation is the only means of death they battle for the prize the nature of which is roughly described claiming that the last man standing will be able to influence the world s destiny through the world leaders in an age old game the prize goes to the last immortal standing the immortals fight by a set of sacred rules which include no fighting on holy ground no matter who regards it as holy immortal combats are one on one with no outside interference the victor claims the loser s powers at some point the few remaining immortals will be drawn to a distant land i e new york city unknown to old world denizens in the 16th century for the gathering where the last surviving immortal will claim the powers of all the others who have lived plot scotland according to the film connor macleod was born in the year 1518 in the village of glenfinnan on the shores of loch shiel in 1536 his clan was in conflict with the rival clan fraser and connor rode along into his first battle the frasers had employed a towering monster of an immortal only known as the kurgan clancy brown who apparently recognized that connor was a fellow immortal though even connor had not discovered this yet the kurgan managed to mortally wound connor in battle but the macleods recovered the body before he could decapitate it the macleods mourned connor but he revived shortly after his death accusing him of witchcraft connor s clansmen beat him and were preparing an execution when his cousin angus macleod james cosmo persuaded them to exile connor instead he managed to escape with his life but torn from his clan and birthplace connor eventually settled in glencoe where he married heather macdonald beatie edney his first wife and received training as a blacksmith from her father in 1541 he was located by a much older immortal who introduced himself as juan sanchez villa lobos ramirez sean connery ramirez soon appointed himself connor s tutor in the situation of being immortal their pursuit of the prize and the rules of this age long game he also explained that his own spanish name was just his current alias he adopted it while serving as chief metallurgist for charles v holy roman emperor also king of spain between 1516 1556 he was originally egyptian and his sword was a katana he received in japan by his father in law masamune masamune was the father of princess shakiko ramirez s third wife a genius ahead of his time in the forging of swords the novelization of this film gives ramirez s original name as tak ne his birth in 896 bc his first death in 851 bc and his marriage to shakiko in 593 bc love and death ramirez told macleod to leave his wife or face heartbreak explaining that i was born 2 437 years ago in that time i ve had three wives the last was shakiko a japanese princess when shakiko died i was shattered i would save you that pain please let heather go connor refused to leave his wife though he trained under ramirez for about a year in 1542 the kurgan managed to locate them both he arrived at their residence while macleod himself was absent the kurgan and ramirez dueled with the frightened heather their only spectator the kurgan managed to decapitate ramirez and proceeded to rape heather in the belief that he was further humiliating his old enemy ramirez and his woman connor soon returned to find his residence in ruins his mentor killed and his wife alive but traumatized she never told him about the rape and connor never learned until 1985 when kurgan mocked ramirez memory ramirez was an effete snob i took his head and raped his woman before his blood was even cold connor stayed by his wife s side for the rest of her life until 1590 dying in connor s arms she confided that her only regret was not having his children after burying heather macleod burned their residence and wandered the world journeying as far away as japan a number of other references in the film connected him to historical figures and events namely an 18th century duel on boston common in which a drunken macleod was repeatedly run through by a sword to no effect by an insulted husband and killing a nazi officer during world war ii the movie hints that his experiences over time left him a bitter cynical man modern day the action then shifts to 1985 new york where the few surviving immortals are drawn for the gathering a final series of confrontations to determine the victor of the prize eventually the last two surviving are connor under the alias of russell edwin nash and the kurgan under the alias of victor kruger meanwhile the spike in murders by decapitation has drawn the attention of the police who suspect connor as the sole person responsible among the investigators of the case is police forensic scientist brenda wyatt roxanne hart her investigation gets her closer to connor and they eventually fall in love with each other this does not escape the attention of the kurgan who abducts her to get connor to finally stand and fight him instead of avoiding the final battle connor battles the kurgan defeats him with a little help from brenda and wins the prize which is revealed to be mortality the ability to sire children and a kind of telepathic empathic gift wherein he can communicate with and influence the greatest minds or most powerful people on the planet hence ramirez s warning to connor as to what horrors someone like the kurgan could bring to the world should he win it some subsequent entries in the franchise have retconned the battle with the kurgan into a personal victory for connor instead of the actual end of the game cast reception the film was directed by russell mulcahy and scripted by peter bellwood larry ferguson and gregory widen upon initial u s release it was not well received but it gained popularity in non domestic markets and on home video today it remains arguably the best known film of the highlander series and the one better received by the public it is noted for its introduction of the themes and concepts further explored by the later movies and tv series trivia the director s cut is nearly identical to the international cut and is 8 minutes longer than the u s cut it includes amongst other things a flashback to world war ii that further develops the character of rachel ellenstein a duel sequence that introduced an asian immortal named yung dol kim was cut from the film and the footage for the scene along with certain other deleted scenes was later destroyed by fire a few stills from the sequence some in color and others in black white did survive and were later used in the collectible card game based on highlander for cards featuring the kim character all that is known about kim is that he was working as a night security guard in a new york city office building at the time of the gathering where he was challenged and ultimately beheaded by the kurgan in the continuity of the film the kurgan s duel with kim takes place before his duel with kastagir the original movie features a soundtrack by queen including princes of the universe which is also used in the highlander television series title sequence queen saw an early screening of highlander and decided to compose music for the film s entire non symphonic soundtrack they wrote many of the songs specifically to match the mood of the scenes when the songs were played notably brian may s who wants to live forever concerning the doomed love of connor and his original mortal highland bride while an album specifically tied to the highlander movie was never released queen s 1986 album a kind of magic a phrase spoken twice in the movie

of the weekly comic book 2000 ad the title character a fire breathing demonic alien fights against the fanatical torquemada grand master of the terran empire in earth s distant future and his attempts to exterminate all alien life grotesque hyperbolic and violent the series possesses a dark wit and biting satirical intent series history the series began in 1980 in issue 167 of 2000ad with a story called comic rock the terror tube in which a freedom fighter called nemesis escaped from torquemada the chief of the tube police after a protracted chase through a complex travel tube system on a planet called termight later revealed to be earth all that was seen of nemesis was the outside of his car spaceship the blitzspear the roots of the story lay in an episode of ro busters also by mills and o neill in which the heroes escaped from the police in a car chase through a tube network which ipc management objected to in terror tube the police were portrayed as a cross between the spanish inquisition torquemada is named after the notorious inquisitor tomás de torquemada and the ku klux klan making it easier to position them as the bad guys terror tube was the first of a planned series of one offs inspired by popular music called comic rock in this case the jam s going underground the series never got going but did produce a second nemesis story a two parter called killer watt in which torquemada chased nemesis through a bizarre teleport system based on telephone lines these stories proved popular prompting mills and o neill to develop a regular series nemesis the warlock which combined the early high concept science fiction with fantasy in the sword and sorcery mould torquemada was promoted from chief of the tube police to grand master of termight nemesis was revealed as a demonic alien with a face based on the nose of his car fighting to protect aliens from torquemada s genocidal tyranny although his inhuman attitude and anarchic khaos philosophy made his motivations ambiguous written at the height of margaret thatcher s grip on the british public the fiercely left wing mills depicts anarchic anti heroes violently railing against a bullish intolerant authority that the authority in question is the human race thousands of years in the future adds a further dimension a heavy handed condemnation of human nature particular targets for mills s ire were imperialism and religious fanaticism book 6 had a comment about south africa and apartheid removed which was reinstated in the titan book reprint the abc warriors and satanus the black tyrannosaur both mills creations were reintroduced as supporting characters and a time travel element was introduced which left the series s timeline extremely convoluted book 9 concluded in 1989 and the character barely appeared for ten years finally in 1999 mills and artists henry flint and o neill wrapped up the series with book 10 the final conflict artists o neill s imaginative grotesque art helped to establish the popularity of the series but the efforts he put in to creating it led to a low rate of productivity there were a number of delays in the publication of the book one and a second book was drawn by jesus redondo this and the higher rates of pay available in america led o neill to leave the series after a handful of episodes of book four although he has occasionally returned for short runs since then replaced by bryan talbot other artists to draw the series include john hicklenton david roach clint langley and henry flint o neill returned to the strip to

city it is signed as route 1 for most of its length and is 96 km long overview the road started as a route built by convicts in the 1850s through lake clifton for most of its length the road went through well timbered sandy limestone country of little value to agriculture the area s first european settler was john fouracre who built a house in this area in 1852 and had established a wayside inn and changing station at wellington location 205 in 1854 settlement was slow due to poor soils in the district although as soil technology improved additives such as superphosphate were added to soils after world war ii demand increased for homes in the myalup binningup region at this point the south western highway through armadale pinjarra and harvey some 20 30km to the east was signed route 1 and carried most traffic from perth to bunbury in the 1950s kwinana was developed as western australia s primary heavy industrial area and from the 1960s onwards rockingham and mandurah previously small villages inhabited by holidaymakers and retirees and servicing low level agricultural districts began to develop rapidly into residential cities by 2001 rockingham mandurah and bunbury would each have over 50 000 people and perth well on its way to 1 5 million at the same time the south west became increasingly popular as a tourist destination made closer to australia and the world by improved air travel old coast road was exactly as its name suggests the old coast road a single carriageway two lane road and neither it nor the town centre of mandurah had ever been designed to cope with the new realities in 1983 the australian labor party under brian burke was elected to office for the first time in over 10 years with a development platform which promoted the growth of regional cities and the building of infrastructure to support that growth at that time old coast road started from the end of pinjarra road at the west end of the mandurah bridge into mandurah s town centre and was a single carriageway road leading out of mandurah s southern suburbs and on to bunbury neither mary street nor the canal estate existed and leighton road was a minor distributor road into northern halls head by 1987 the mandurah bypass had been built around mandurah s south and inner east bypassing halls head and the mandurah bridge and town centre and bringing traffic onto the original fremantle road at silver sands then called mandurah beach and onto a rockingham bypass ennis avenue originally constructed as a minor regional road in the late 1970s and later upgraded in 1988 rockingham was declared a city and in 1990 mandurah followed at the other end of the road bunbury was growing as well in 1988 1989 after expansion of bunbury s port a number of industries including a titanium dioxide pigment factory and a silicon producing smelter opened at kemerton just off the old coast road near australind western australia residential growth in eaton and australind increased during the 1980s the bunbury tower was built in 1986 and state government departments opened up offices there by 2001 australind had grown to house 5 900 people in the late 1990s the australind bypass was built to relieve pressure on old coast road the next stage will be to extend the kwinana freeway from its present terminus at safety bay road baldivis to become the peel deviation terminating between preston beach and myalup it is not clear when this road will be completed but land in both towns is being subdivided by developers in anticipation of increased opportunities sections of the old coast road are considered notorious claiming many road accident victims data from the main roads department show that between 1996 and 2006 there were 1 560 serious crashes with 42 fatalities description in mandurah the road starts at a roundabout in mary street halls head as a minor regional road serving the canal estate in eastern halls head prior to the construction of the canal estate in 1986 87 this was part of the main route through mandurah to perth and fed onto the mandurah bridge as pinjarra road while leighton road became a minor regional road into northern halls head old coast road then turns right at the mandurah bypass and takes on route 1 becoming a dual carriageway at this point it then proceeds through mandurah s southern suburbs of falcon and wannanup port bouvard and crosses the dawesville channel on a three lane bridge about 1km later the highway becomes the dawesville bypass with old coast road turning off into a minor north south regional road through the eastern part of dawesville before resuming with the highway mandurah to australind the highway reduces to a single carriageway and goes through bouvard herron and lake clifton and passing turnoffs to preston beach myalup and binningup the countryside for this part is mostly jarrah and marri forest with some wetland vegetation and some cleared land being used for farming especially around myalup just after the turnoff to the kemerton industrial estate route 1 follows onto the australind bypass while old coast road turns off passing entrances to the rural residential suburb of leschenault before entering australind australind to bunbury the road travels for about 4 km before bridging the collie river and passing eaton and pelican point it then comes to an end at the australind bypass in the suburb of glen iris about 6 km from bunbury s cbd major intersections at halls head mandurah bypass to rockingham and perth at dawesville dawesville bypass both

 id=455898 title blade runner video game nonfiltered 296 processed 291 dbindex 1560297 blade runner is a westwood studios pc game loosely based on the 1982 movie of the same name released in 1997 the game was advertised as the first real time adventure game the story featured blade runner ray mccoy searching for replicants in los angeles in the year 2019 while it was generally agreed that the game s graphics and sound music composed by frank klepacki succeeded in adapting the cult film s haunting atmosphere the designers attempt at innovating gameplay such as simplifying the interface adding action elements replacing a traditional inventory with a database of clues randomization of some events as well as multiple endings were given mixed reviews the game performed poorly commercially and since it coincided with the release of lucasarts curse of monkey island another commercial flop many deemed the adventure genre to have become a stale one thus losing its mainstream status to fps titles like quake ii and half life background and plotline plot or ending details follow the blade runner videogame is based on the 1982 movie of the same name the game is set not long after the beginning of the movie we can see this as tyrell hasn t been killed yet as well as many more minor plot details such as holden having been attacked and taken out of commission and in an optional meeting with tyrell the mention of tyrell being in a meeting with deckard earlier that day in november of 2019 our protagonist ray mccoy is a rookie bladerunner under command of guzza a police officer of superior rank true to the film the environment is similar a dystopian heavily polluted los angeles brought to life by the fledgling 3d real time technology of the day also included are some landmarks from the movie such as the dominating tyrell pyramid structures mccoy is faced with the task of tracking down a group of replicants and retiring killing them the game is unique to the point and click genre in that it begins in a highly complicated fashion and continues that way till the game s conclusions you progress through a number of crime scenes in which you must gather evidence this is a matter of being highly observative of surroundings as well as using techniques typical of detectives gameplay the blade runner videogame is notable for its accurate to the movie even lovingly imitated environments and for remaining quite true to philip k dick s novel the game is in some ways even truer to the book than was the movie in that ray mccoy is more troubled by his identity than the film version of deckard much like the book s version of said character ray laments through a character named lucy who faces a similar dilemma the theme is carried further by the many choices the player can make for ray which determine his eventual fate puzzle solving is a major element of the game one must solve a number of compulsory puzzles and find a number of clues in order to progress the game s storyline clues are found by searching crime scenes and areas in general the first such scene being a trashed pet shop clues come in the form of items photographs personal interviews or unusual markings one can also use the esper system located in the police precinct and in mccoy s apartment to enhance photos potentially finding some crucial information combat in blade runner is occasional and extremely simplistic there is one weapon in the game ray s standard issue police pistol however different varieties of ammunition are available in 1997 when the game was released westwood promoted the game s then unique real time system which mainly comprises a series of scripted character paths and events which should in theory add up to a highly replayable game the game also includes considerable randomization of certain events but ultimately these do not have a major effect the alignment of certain characters whether they are human or replicant also varies between playthroughs and an experienced player can tell what certain characters will be from the evidence collected e g whether mccoy perceives a suspect as an expert or amateur bomber the game includes thirteen different endings some of which vary slightly depending on choice much akin to philip k dick s writing or many crime novels the game deceives and confuses the player intermittently before eventually allowing them to witness ray s destiny characters ray mccoy ray mccoy is the game s protagonist and a rookie police officer with the badge number br 61 661 he is younger and less experienced than his film counterpart deckard having been assigned to the blade runner unit referred to also as rep detect other runners often treat him with condescension crystal for example or patronize him like gaff does mccoy lives in an apartment building apartment 88f with his pet dog maggie for whom he shows a great deal of affection during the course of the game ray investigates several crimes including animal murders a serious crime in the dystopian world of blade runner homicide or illegal weapons selling eventually he is framed for murder of izo a black market gun runner by his superior lieutenant guzza who considers him dangerous to his business at the police station which involves deals with black market providers or silencing of witnesses forced to hide mccoy explores the dark decrepit underworld of 2019 los angeles which allows him to make contact with the twins luther and lance former tyrell employees and break into the tyrell corporation pyramids to steal the basic dna sequence for the nexus 6 replicant series when twins are given this data they reward mccoy with a detailed report containing all evidence of guzza s crimes which mccoy uses to blackmail his former superior and force him to set his falsified record straight and to set up a meeting in the kipple where guzza used to meet his black market contacts it is during this face off that guzza is wounded by sadik s pulse rifle and the decision as to what to do with him the player can either run off from the scene or perform a coup de grace on the lieutenant this decision affects the game s ending mccoy wears a light brown lounge suit a dark tie and a brown trenchcoat looking similar to deckard he uses a standard issue 45 blaster as his sidearm roy mccoy is voiced by mark benninghofen crystal steele crystal steele badge number br 61 354 is one of the most effective police officers in the lapd blade runner unit she is an excellent marksman setting nearly a perfect score on the police shooting range and also an exceptional undercover cop she refers to replicants as skin jobs and is very much in favour of their extermination she also has rather unconventional methods of interrogating suspects as evidenced by her questioning of spencer grigorian who at first refused to give details about suspicious individuals in his group however in the second part of the same interview he hastily describes them and he is clearly shaken in regards to ray mccoy she is playful with a considerable amount of condescension towards the rookie her cases often intersect with mccoy s such as the aforementioned tyrell manufacturing plant bombing carried out by sadik one of the replicants involved in izo s black market trade crystal also saves mccoy s life before he can be executed by two cops sent by guzza to silence him shortly thereafter he is marked as a suspect and an apb is put out on him but steele lets him go stating that he s not on her list her fate in the game is ultimately tied to the player s actions and she can either die killed by the player or in an explosion set up by sadik or survive and pair up with mccoy following the retirement of clovis the rogue replicants leader in the moonbus crystal is voiced by lisa edelstein gaff gaff is a character originally presented in the film he is a competent veteran cop who appears at various intervals to give advice to mccoy who he seems to see as young and thus unpredictable he taunts you killed anyone yet in a semi playful semi serious attempt to coax mccoy into a response he shares crystal s view on replicants though to a lesser more casual extent lt guzza lt guzza is the boorish overweight superior to mccoy and overall commander in chief of the blade runner unit following bryant s leave guzza is rather unkempt and asocial remaining in bryant s office for most of blade runner s duration appearing briefly in the hawker s circle in the animoid row where he is photographed by izo talking to a policeman looking strikingly similiar to the one who later arrests and interrogates mccoy the arrest was set up by guzza who has framed mccoy for murder mccoy was coming too close to discovering guzza s illegal operations these included dealing with replicants despite his apparent hatred for them and selling police grade weaponry on the black market with use of incept photos provided by clovis guzza marks ray mccoy as a replicant hoping that he will be removed however the framed blade runner manages to procure a detailed report of guzza s illegal activities using this information he eventually forces guzza to dismiss the charges and clear his file and makes him meet with mccoy deep underneath los angeles guzza s most probable fate is to be killed during the meeting in the kipple surrounding los angeles and his body to disappear in the extremely toxic waste flowing beneath the city the character is voiced by jeff garlin clovis the leader of the renegade replicants on earth clovis is a man of mystery on one hand he appears as a peaceful highly educated man eloquent and elegant on the other he is sometimes a ruthless brute capable of inhuman acts of aggression as evidenced by his attack on runciter s animals he led the hijacking of the moonbus which allowed him and his followers to arrive on earth seeking a way to extend their four year lifespan he also wanted to see the serene and beautiful planet he learned about from books the disappointment of seeing it devastated by the terran war might have added to his determination throughout the course of the game he works to acquire different elements of replicant dna in order to fulfill the goal of living and manages to coerce two siamese twins luther and lance to bypass the virii encoded in the dna and prolong the lifespan the search for dna would take him to los angeles dna row where tyrell subcontractors work without the corporation s security contacted contractors icluded moraji who designed the skin leaving him to die with an explosive charge planted by sadik next to him and j f sebastian the nervous system designer the search would even take clovis to tyrell s headquarters where he confronted the doctor himself almost killing him before the security intervened and forced him to jump through the window clovis was an extremely intelligent man similar to roy batty who would carefully plan and execute those plans when he struck a bargain with guzza which included false evidence to frame mccoy he intended to coerce the detective into acquiring dna data for him and eventually make him join the replicants his ultimate fate is highly dependant on the player s actions if he chooses to ally with the replicants by shooting guzza in the sewers he can either make his way to the moonbus and leave with him and sadik or if he spared one of his potential love interests dektora or lucy he can leave with them via the ruined tunnel beneath crazy legs larry s car dealership in the former ending clovis survives and leads the replicants off world while in the latter he is shot on board the moonbus by gaff if the player chooses to side with the police he assists steele in killing the remaining renegade replicants eventually confronting the resigned clovis clovis is voiced by mark rolston sadik zuben dektora luther lance the twins and gordo frizz are the game s remaining replicants their characters develop in cut scenes and player s interactions with them their main goal is to evade retirement and to acquire the dna sequences used to create them which would allow them to live longer they would then escape earth on a hijacked moonbus some are neither aggressive or hateful towards human beings clovis and sadik being exceptions on several occasions the replicants are extremely wary of their status as fugitives some of the replicants hold down jobs zuben works in a chinese restaurant as a chef dektora is a model exotic dancer and the twins are recently dismissed employees of the tyrell corporation turned wheeler dealers mostly in the business of passing artificial animals off as the genuine article and gordo frizz is a comedian it should be noted that sadik dektora and gordo may or may not be replicants depending on how the plot unfolds clovis zuben and the twins are the only characters in the game who are guaranteed to be replicants on every playthrough eldon tyrell is another character originally presented in the film the founder ceo and owner of the tyrell corporation he is a remarkable genius being responsible for developing the basic dna sequence for the nexus 6 series of replicants he is good friends with dr marcus eisenduller a gravity expert and j f sebastian a dna designer living in the bradbury building in dna row in los angeles as he is not yet deceased one assumes the game is set shortly after the beginning of the film tyrell owns an artificial owl which is very rare as owls were one of the first species to become extinct following world war iii lucy is a teenager of about 14 who is unsure whether she is a replicant or a human and is very concerned as to which she truly is the extent to which she can appear in the game depends on the player s actions if she comes to interact with ray she grows very fond of him seeing him as a dependable figure lucy may or may not be a replicant but within the game is more often than not identified as human via the voight kampff test rachel is tyrell s secretary and as with rachel in the film is a replicant who mimics humanity extremely well she is modeled after tyrell s niece she is very attractive well spoken and brusque and appears only briefly within the game as she has not yet paired with deckard one again assumes the game is set shortly after the beginning of the movie her status as a confirmed replicant is not revealed in the game j f sebastian is also similar to his film counterpart a reclusive loner residing in the enormous bleak and dilapidated bradbury building accompanied only by his eerie robotic puppets he owns several futuristic devices such as a synthetic egg creator he is one of the chief scientists who assisted in the creation of the nexus 6 replicant models chew is another scientist who assisted the tyrell corporation in the creation of replicants unlike j f sebastian his speciality is eyes he is much like the chew we see in the motion picture highly intelligent but at the same time a wary eccentric and cautious person he conducts his work in a small laboratory opposite the twins apartment bryant is the police captain of the precinct but is supposedly absent from the game due to sick leave his stand in is lieutenant guzza izo is a gun dealer of seemingly asian descent specializing in the dealing of rare high specification automatic guns he supplies these weapons to the replicants and sympathizes with their cause he also owns a samurai sword and when cornered he becomes highly aggressive prior to becoming a felon he was a member of a fledgling replicant sympathizer group bob is a grizzled veteran of world war iii which appears to have been a pivotal event a decade or so prior to 2019 he mentions that he served for around three and a half years he owns the gunshop across the street from animoid row and seems to be suffering from some physical disabilities he appears to despise replicants even more than crystal though when a voight kampff test is administered his result is almost always inconclusive when he does receive a definitive result it is almost always human bob is the only character with whom the player s tampering with the voight kampff test can alter the result this allows the player to decide whether he is human or replicant and therefore whether he can be killed by the player without any fear of repercussion minor characters other more minor characters include the police station cops whom you may interact with at certain crime scenes the precinct s forensic examiner named dino klein mia and murray the elderly couple selling grilled tofu on animoid row howie lee the owner of a restaurant bearing his name in the chinatown district of los angeles the various storekeepers seen throughout the game and crazy legs larry a quick talking paraplegic car salesman and the owner of a car salesroom on animoid row the game engine the game engine was innovative for its time 1997 and many gaming magazines notably pc gamer were raving about it thinking it was the future for the first time ever you had a real time 3d game that didn t require or use the still very rare and expensive 3d graphics accelerators it achieved this through a self developed technology based on voxels pixels with width height and depth examples of voxels are the static sprites in duke nukem 3d that turn when you turn so that they always follow your orientation and face directly into the camera they went with that idea and expanded it calling it voxels plus the polygon data of every model was there in the game just like in games today but it was not rendered as a 3d accelerator would instead they developed an advanced voxel based technology so that they could escape the need for a 3d accelerator displaying the polygon geometry basically instead of just having one two dimensional voxel sprite they used dozens of rotating voxels in the shape and depth of the actual polygon model data making it true real time 3d without requiring 3d hardware in laymans term it was piecing together flat picture panels rotating and positioning them in 3d space so that they gave the illusion of a 3d object this must still be called 3d and not 2d as many people keep insisting for their lack of better knowledge it was a great accomplishment but it wasn t without its share of flaws the technology made the 3d models look quite rough due to the low amount of voxels used to display them and if they had gone any higher to increase the detail it would have become too slow to play with the level of detail they settled on the game still ran at a minimum of 15 fps even on slow systems and even though it was groundbreaking it ended up being the only voxel plus game ever released due to the fact that 3d accelerators became more common around that time therefore the need for this complex workaround technology faded fast which meant that ultimately they had released their technology too late for a deeper history on the development there s an interview with one of the westwood developers trivia in the arcade called hysteria hall westwood studios command

south of sarajevo it is a mountainous heavily wooded area the municipality extends on both sides of the neretva river the main town also named konjic housed about a third of the total population today the population of konjic municipality is estimated at 39 000 people konjic during the bosnian war during conflict in yugoslavia konjic municipality was of strategic importance as it contained important communication links from sarajevo to southern bosnia and herzegovina during the siege of sarajevo the route through konjic was of vital imortance to the bosnian government forces furthermore several important military facilities were contained in konjic including the igman arms and ammunition factory the jna ljuta barracks the reserve command site of the jna the zlatar communications and telecommunications centre and the celebici barracks and warehouses although the konjic municipality did not have a majority serb population and did not form part of the declared serb autonomous regions in march 1992 the self styled serb konjic municipality adopted a decision on the serbian territories the sds in co operation with the jna had also been active in arming the serb population of the municipality and in training paramilitary units and militias according to dr andrew james gow an expert witness for the prosecution the sds distributed around 400 weapons to serbs in the area konjic was also included in those areas claimed by the hdz in bosnia and herzegovina as part of the croatian community of herceg bosna despite the fact that the croats did not constitute a majority of the population there either thus there were hvo units established and armed in the municipality by april 1992 following the international recognition of the independent bosnian state and the walk out of sds representatives from the municipal assembly a war assembly was formed to take charge of the defence of the municipality between 20 april and early may 1992 bosnian government forces seized control over most of the strategic assets of the municipality and some armaments however serb forces controlled the main access points to the municipality effectively cutting it off from outside supply bosniak refugees began to arrive from outlying areas of the municipality expelled by serbs while serb inhabitants of the town left for serb controlled villages according to the decision made by serb leadership on 4 may 1992 the first shells landed in konjic town fired by the jna and other serb forces from the slopes of borasnica and kisera this shelling which continued daily for over three years until the signing of the dayton peace agreement inflicted substantial damage and resulted in the loss of many lives as well as rendering conditions for the surviving population even more unbearable with the town swollen from the influx of refugees there was a great shortage of accommodation as well as food and other basic necessities charitable organisations attempted to supply the local people with enough food but all systems of production foundered or were destroyed it was not until august or september of that year that convoys from the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr managed to reach the town and all communications links were cut off with the rest of the state a clear priority for the konjic authorities was the de blocking of the routes to sarajevo and mostar this objective required that the serbian forces holding bradina and donje selo as well as those at borci and other strategic points be disarmed this objective required that the serbian forces holding bradina and donje selo as well as those at borci and other strategic points be disarmed initially an attempt was made at negotiation with the sds and other representatives of the serb people in bradina and donje selo this did not however achieve success for the konjic authorities and plans were made for the launching of military operations by the joint command the first area to be

and police the celibici prison camp these military operations resulted in the arrest of many members of the serb population and it was thus necessary to create a facility where they could be imprisoned and questioned about their role in war crimes during the siege of konjic the former jna celebici compound was chosen out of necessity as the appropriate facilities for the detention of prisoners in konjic the majority of the prisoners who were detained between april and december 1992 were men captured during and after the military operations at bradina and donje selo and their surrounding areas at the end of may several groups were transferred to the celebici prison camp from various locations in its judgement in the case of delalic et al the icty found that serbian

de l international ouvrière sfio the contemporary name of the french socialist party the french turn was repeated by trotskyists in other countries during the 1930s in france the idea of the french turn originated after the 6 february 1934 riots around the stavisky affair in 1934 which led to the downfall of the daladier government fearing that fascists would seize power like they had in germany and italy the socialist party sfio and french communist party pcf formed a united front the communist league the french section of the international left opposition remained at this time a small and predominantly middle class organization leon trotsky saw a great opportunity in the united front for an expansion of the trotskyists ranks while he saw no possibility of re entering the communist party because of its lack of internal democracy he believed that the trotskyists could build a base in the sfio which had moved to the left under the leadership of léon blum trotsky formally proposed the french turn into the sfio in june of 1934 the communist league s leaders were divided over the issue of entering the sfio while raymond molinier was the most supportive of trotsky s proposal pierre naville vocally opposed the motion and pierre frank remained ambivalent after two months of formal discussion the league voted to dissolve into the sfio in august 1934 in the socialist party they formed the bolshevik leninist group groupe bolchevik leniniste gbl upon entering the sfio the gbl began to build a base among the party s left wing the trotskyists influence was strongest in the youth affiliate young socialists and the parisian party brances at the mulhouse party congress of june 1935 the trotskyists led a campaign to prevent the united front from expanding into a popular front which would include the middle class radical party jean rous of the gbl was elected to the sfio s national administrative committee after the adoption of the popular front trotsky advised the gbl to break with the sfio and begin forming a new revolutionary party this created fresh divisions within the gbl s leadership while naville supported a split molinier hoped to develop connections with marceau pivert one of the primary leaders of the sfio s left wing this led to a confused and awkward departure by the trotskyists from the socialist party in early 1936 which drew only about six hundred people from the party molinier and naville formed two separate parties and their divisions were reinforced over how to relate to pivert s new party the workers and peasants socialist party psop the french trotskyists were dispersed when world war ii began but in 1944 they re unified into the internationalist communist party pci in other countries in other countries the french turn was repeated by trotsky s other followers in the united states the workers party of the united states entered the socialist party of america in 1936 they formed a faction around the newspaper socialist appeal they drew their strongest support among members of the young people s socialist league the sp s youth affiliate the trotskyists and their supporters were expelled from the sp in 1937 and in 1938 formed a new party the socialist workers party factions of trotsky s followers in great britain who were organized as the communist league in 1932 entered the independent labour party and the labour party in subsequent years they emerged from these parties in 1944 to form the revolutionary communist party consequences the french turn remained a lasting issue of debate between trotsky s often divided followers after world war ii some believed that the french turn was a success and they promoted the idea that entryism should be continued the main advocates of this view in the 1950s and 1960s were michel pablo secretary of the international secretariat of the fourth international and gerry healy secretary of the international committee of the fourth international which both supported entrism pablo developed a special type of the turn which involved working underground in the communist parties this was strongly opposed by the icfi others in the trotskyist movement have who believed the french turn to be either a failure or unprincipled and advocated the independence of trotskyists from social democratic and communist parties hugo oehler developed this view at the time of the french turn the issue of entryism remains a point of contention among trotskyists to this day see also entryism trotskyism second international fourth international further reading robert

 id=1868825 title waking the dragons nonfiltered 336 processed 330 dbindex 1560338 the waking the dragons story arc is one of the story arcs in the anime series yu gi oh duel monsters the story arc is exclusive to the anime not based on the original manga being one of the two created to make distance between the prior battle city story arc and the following millennium world arc the story arc is also called the doma d ma story arc named for the storyline s central antagonists these antagonists are valon alister and rafael the doma organization sometimes misread as doom is also known as the orichalcos storyline named for one of the central cards played within this card causes players to lose their souls if they lose gameplay mechanics unlike the anime exclusive virtual world story arc before it the story arc does not introduce any new gameplay elements instead it is notably the first time that fusion monsters were permitted to attack on the turn that they were summoned a tactic illegal during battle city games remain a 4000 point battle and monsters are still permitted to be summoned face up in defense mode instead the focus is spent on creating new anime exclusive cards which allow the user to bend the rules in subtle ways plot this page uses the english anime names since this arc does not take place in the manga the storyline is based around an organization named doma in the japanese version which uses a card known as the seal of orichalcos to entrap the souls of people and duel monsters alike in an effort to revive an ancient monster known as the great leviathan the beast was the center of the destruction of atlantaean society 10 000 years ago well before the time of the egyptians for which the rest of the series is based against in the past the great leviathan was defeated by the three legendary dragons timaeus critias and hermos although not destroyed the leviathan was severely weakened forcing dartz king of atlantis and his doma organization to collect souls for 10 000 years dartz knew that he would succeed after seeing the power of atem in ancient egypt some thousands of years later in the english adaptation dartz cites the shadow realm specifically the god cards stolen the story begins after the end of the battle city tournament with the three egyptian god cards in the possession of yugi muto romanized as yugi mutou in the english manga one night a group of perpetrators break into the kame game shop and steal the three god cards from his possession giving chase to the thieves they eventually encounter grerimo a mysterious man in a cape grerimo is collecting souls for the group and plans to collect the souls of duelists by defeating them in a duel to this end he uses the seal of orichalcos card a field magic card that could not be dispelled and prevented outside interference with only the winner of the duel being able to escape the seal although grerimo manages to unleash the power of obelisk the tormentor against its former owner yugi eventually wins the duel but ultimately fails to recover the god cards the god cards eventually arrive at the hands of dartz who sacrifices their power to awaken the beast releasing the legendary dragons the next night as the world sees a giant eye in the sky yugi and the pharaoh awaken in the depths of the millennium puzzle where kuriboh urges them to follow a portal hidden inside the puzzle to the world of beasts where a similar eye is stationed while there they are greeted by dark magician girl who tells the two of the great leviathan and urges them to pull a sword from an ice statue they do so and unlock the power of legendary dragon timaeus who proceeds to destroy the eye in the sky above the world of beasts similarly yugi would unleash the same power in the real world forcing the great leviathan to retreat the other two dragons would also be unleashed in a similar manner the legendary dragon critias was unlocked by seto kaiba in a duel after kowtowing to a demand allegedly by maximillion pegasus to duel at his duelist kingdom as a publicity stunt there he discovers that one of the thieves amelda alister named for aleister crowley who coined the unicursal hexagram that acts as the symbol of the orichalcos in the english version had led him there wanting retribution for what kaibacorp had done against his family although the seal of orichalcos was used the battle was fought to a draw allowing both alister and kaiba to escape unharmed the third dragon the legendary dragon hermos would be unlocked by joey wheeler katsuya jonouchi when yugi and his friends receive a video from pegasus as it turns out shortly before he is defeated and his soul sealed who implores yugi and his friends to travel to america and retrieve a card that holds the key to defeating their then unknown threat at pegasus industrial illusions however they are locked inside the building where mai valentine mai kujaku emerges to battle joey during this duel yugi and friends discovered that mai had been wandering the earth after the battle city tournament although she finished in the top eight she was always overshadowed by joey a semifinalist and continually traumatized by her loss to marik ishtar which seriously injured her determined to become stronger at any cost and never wanting to lose another duel again mai eventually wound up with dartz and eagerly accepted the offer of becoming stronger not realizing that the orichalcos would be her undoing the change in mai s behavior would as it turns out be partially due to valon the second of doma s three swordsmen who had cared for mai in her time of need and wanted her to move on with her life by defeating joey effectively also doing his work for her when joey appears to have the upper hand thanks to hermos valon uses his orichalcos stone to break the seal rendering the match a no contest and allowing both mai and joey to survive meanwhile duke devlin ryuji otogi accompanied by weevil underwood insector haga and rex raptor dinosaur ryuzaki would manage to break into the building and unlock the doors seto and mokuba kaiba would also appear and all of them would help yugi find the card that pegasus claimed would help yugi end the threat of doma yet when they find it it is blank yugi s sacrifice the third swordsman rafael would later challenge yugi rafael claimed that yugi and his friends are fighting for the wrong cause and that rafael was a noble hero out to save the world he claimed that mankind was inherently evil and that the orichalcos exposed the darkness within the souls of mankind thus the need for them to be sealed by the seal of orichalcos however as yugi dueled he finds himself easily outmatched by rafael s guardian monsters which he refused to allow to go to the card graveyard after a move that exchanged a card between the two hands yugi finds himself with the seal of orichalcos not wanting to lose yet not wanting to play the seal the two faces of yugi would debate over whether to use the card blind by the desire to win at any cost the pharaoh wins out yugi wanted to avoid the card even if it meant he lost the duel and plays the seal in order to power up his monsters using the ability of catapult turtle he sacrifices monster after monster to wear away at rafael s life points even sacrificing his trusted dark magician and dark magician girl in the process yet rafael is able to survive and use the situation to his advantage by summoning guardian eatos eatos would use the spirits of yugi s own monsters to defeat yugi as the seal slowly circles around the fallen pharaoh however yugi realizes that two souls reside within one body and allows the seal to take him instead sacrificing himself so that the pharaoh would survive meanwhile weevil and rex after seeing the power of the orichalcos seek to have the power for themselves fighting the darkness the pharaoh mourned for the loss of yugi and despite the attempts of his friends to cheer him up remained in a funk meanwhile as the pharaoh and company continue to travel weevil and rex meet dartz who grants them the power of the orichalcos in return however they are told to use their newfound power on the pharaoh and joey a win win scenario for dartz in any event the two would manage to hijack the train the pharaoh and company would be riding in weevil isolating yugi and téa gardner anzu mazaki while rex finding joey and tristan taylor hiroto honda thus the two duelist kingdom rematches were slated to begin only with much more on the line while joey would have little trouble dispatching rex with the help of hermos timaeus would seemingly abandon the pharaoh forcing him to win the duel without it he would ultimately prevail against weevil with the help of breaker the magical warrior which along with its ability and berserker soul allowed it to attack weevil repeatedly as long as the pharaoh drew and discarded monsters which he did ruthlessly téa would implore the pharaoh to stop long after yugi had beaten weevil just as yugi was about to discard dark magician girl just then however the moving train would head off a cliff although they would survive having been rescued by a mysterious person when the pharaoh came to his saviour would be revealed as ironheart ironheart would lead the pharaoh to a place of lost souls where the pharaoh found the spirit of yugi yugi confronts the pharaoh and implores him to face himself through a duel with both players sharing the same deck in this duel yugi would bring forth the seal of orichalcos and would use a similar strategy to what the pharaoh had used against rafael yet the pharaoh ultimately succeeds after successfully countering yugi s moves despite not wanting to lose yugi again just as he was about to leave however dartz who had been observing the pharaoh s activities conjures a spell to bring forth an orichalcos soldier while fighting the orichalcos soldier however the pharaoh realizes that timaeus is his only hope of winning yet he cannot use it as he does not have the card in his deck after having given it to ironheart believing him to be unworthy of the card s power ironheart and his family consisting of daughter chris and pet dog skye would sacrifice their lives to deliver the card to yugi who uses it successfully to defeat the orichalcos soldier with the darkness within himself defeated the pharaoh could finally move on and hope to find and free yugi wherever he may be the fall of the swordsmen each of the three swordsmen were chosen for their apparent misfortunes in life all of which as it turns out was orchestrated by dartz alister came from a war torn region and his life revolved around helping himself and his brother survive the ravages of war ultimately however his family was killed captured in the english adaptation by opposing forces who were allegedly funded by kaiba corporation holding its head gozaburo kaiba responsible alister seeks his adopted sons for revenge he manages to hijack the plane kaiba and mokuba were piloting and seeks a rematch with seto to end it once and for all as the duel moves on alister recounts his history with the kaiba corporation and notes that whether he wins or loses the plane will crash allowing the seal of orichalcos to claim all three lives kaiba willing to protect mokuba at any cost would use critias to prevail in his brief moment of defeat before being claimed by the orichalcos alister sees a bit of his brother in mokuba allowing him to stop living in the past move on with his life valon was a juvinile delinquent always getting into fights when he gets into a fight with a gang of street thugs they retaliate by burning a local church down along with a nun who had taken care of him in revenge he had killed the street thugs and as a result he was sent to prison this detail was omitted from the english adaptation there valon was imprisoned without the reason being mentioned he was sent in and out of twelve detention centers before a warden turns him into duel monsters there the warden sets forth a battle royale style challenge where the winner would be set free valon would eventually be the winner having trapped all others within the seal of orichalcos he is granted release into the custody of the prison s sponsor dartz valon in his view saw joey as the big obstacle in mai s life and vowed to take him down in her honor while joey wants to take down valon believing that doma is to blame for turning mai against him when their duel inevitably begins valon uses his deck of armor monsters zero attack and zero defense monsters with devastating effects to literally form a suit of armor around himself intending to literally beat joey senseless likewise joey is forced to defend himself with a suit of armor of his own formed from his trusted red eyes black dragon the two would physically punish each other throughout the match with joey coming out in front the duel between valon and joey would arouse mai s interest and joey would be forced to duel her in order to set the record straight joey tired and physically beaten from the previous duel is unable to concentrate on the duel yet manages to deal serious damage to mai yet he manages to reach out to her just as joey is about to lose mai would ultimately not attack joey and win the duel but joey collapses in exhaustion allowing the seal of orichalcos to take his soul taking the fallen hermos with her she proceeds to confront rafael the last of the three swordsmen where it is implied that her soul was also taken rafael came from a well off family which was taken from him when they were separated from each other at a young age he was the sole survivor of a luxury liner disaster and washed up ashore on a deserted island rafael would live on the island for twelve years with his guardian cards the only thing allowing him to retain his sanity his attitude in dueling was simple as the cards had cared for him during those years he would try to do the same to his monsters when he was eventually rescued he found that the world he lived in had changed unwilling to accept the outside world rafael turned to dartz when rafael confronts the pharaoh again he hands the pharaoh hermos and promises to defeat the pharaoh like he did before this time however it is instead rafael who uses the seal of orichalcos to the pharaoh s horror up to that point it seemed that rafael was not the type of person who would use such a card like the pharaoh before rafael would proceed to sacrifice his trusted guardians all to power up his deadliest guardian guardian dreadscythe a guardian who could be revived simply by discarding a single card determined to set rafael free and see the errors of his ways the pharaoh takes it upon himself to destroy dreadscythe by any means necessary and he does so with the combined power of hermos and guardian eatos rafael s most trusted guardian with rafael seeing the error of his ways he uses a final magic card to resummon all his guardians at the cost of the remainder of his life points though rafael loses his soul is surprisingly not taken the final battle rafael proceeds to tell the pharaoh and company where to find dartz and they proceed to dartz s lair where they find an entire room of captured souls dartz appears and challenges the pharaoh and kaiba in a two on one match dartz however is more powerful than the three swordsmen combined not only is he able to repel of the master of dragon soldier a fusion of two of kaiba s and the pharaoh s most powerful cards but he has two additional seals of orichalcos orichalcos deuteros and orichalcos tritos which would give dartz even more life points making additional attacks fruitless furthermore his array of mirror knights is making the pharaoh reluctant to attack as the souls of his fallen friends are trapped inside each one when rafael tries to intervene he unleashes his stored up rage at dartz who at that point revealed that he was the source of rafael s troubles in life and the seal of orichalcos dormant since his earlier duel takes his soul kaiba however sees past dartz s tricks to throw the pharaoh off guard and proceeds to attack by destroying his monsters however dartz releases an even more powerful monster which easily defeats kaiba allowing the seal of orichalcos to claim him desperate for a comeback yugi manages to draw the blank card that pegasus gave him only this time the card has changed to the legend of heart allowing the true nature of the legendary dragons to be revealed in the past the kingdom of atlantis was guarded by three knights which were turned into dragons and sealed away during the battles that eventually destroyed atlantis by using the legend of heart the three legendary dragons revert to their true form allowing the legendary knights to be reborn the three knights manage to destroy the three seals of orichalcos as well as dartz s monsters yet dartz has a last resort up his sleeves by sacrificing all of his life points he could summon the divine serpent which has infinite attack and defense and also allow dartz to continue to duel as long as it remains likewise yugi is forced to similarly entrust his own livelihood to dark magician girl by combining all three knights of atlantis to form the knight of destiny the divine serpent is destroyed winning the duel in yugi s favor although as a result the souls of yugi joey and kaiba are freed dartz sacrifices his own soul allowing the great leviathan to be reborn attack of the great leviathan the great leviathan has been reborn thanks to dartz s own sacrifice even the combined forces of the knights of atlantis and the most powerful of yugi s kaiba s and joey s monsters were not enough to stop it their only hope as it seems was to put all their own power into reviving the three gods of egypt the winged dragon of ra obelisk the tormentor and slifer the sky dragon with the three monsters revived with the power of the light of all dartz s prisioners this greatly reduces the leviathan s strength enough for the three gods to easily destroy it freeing all the captive souls in the process yet the great leviathan would continue to exist as it was made from the evils of mankind the pharaoh wanting to help dartz be rid of the influence of the orichalcos takes it upon himself to personally ensure that the great leviathan and the influence of the orichalcos is no more with it gone dartz returns to normal and proceeds happily into the afterlife as for the main characters the knights of atlantis and dark magician girl thank them for their assistance and return to the world of the beasts the three legendary dragon cards as well as the legend of heart disappear just as they came vowing to reappear when the world is in danger again endofarticle doc doc

from data general in 1999 history patented in 1994 the clariion disk array had some interesting features that are now standard in the data storage and computing industry features mentioned in the patent paperwork included hot swappability guide rails for proper electrical contact and a method to lock the drives in place once they were secured in the disk enclosure the clariion line quickly spanned from 7 slot scsi disk arrays to 30 slot scsi disk arrays in 1997 data general s clariion division took the unusual step of adopting an emerging standard fibre channel the fc5000 array utilized a fibre channel arbitrated loop connection that doubled the performance of scsi arrays at that time from there the clariion disk arrays grew into a fast expandable midrange storage platform culminating in the fc5700 under data general after emc acquired data general in 1999 significant development of a new range of clariion arrays took place with the development of the fc4500 and fc4700

order cingulata until as recently as 1995 the family was placed in the order xenarthra along with the anteaters and sloths there are approximately 10 several living genera and around 20 living species of armadillo some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armor their average length is about 75 centimeters 30 inches including tail the giant armadillo reaches roughly 90 cm 3 ft while the pink fairy armadillos are diminutive species with an overall length of 12 15 cm 4 5 in all species are native to the americas where they inhabit a variety of environments in the united states the sole resident armadillo is the nine banded armadillo dasypus novemcinctus which is most common in the central southernmost states particularly texas habitat and physiology armadillos are prolific diggers and many species use their sharp claws to dig for food such as grubs and to dig dens the nine banded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks streams and arroyos near which it lives and feeds the diet of different armadillo species varies but consists mainly of insects grubs and other invertebrates some species however are almost entirely formicivorous feeding mainly on ants armadillos have poor vision but are not blind the armor is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in small overlapping epidermal scales called scutes this armor like skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos although most escape predators by fleeing often into thorny patches which their armor protects them from or digging to safety only the south american three banded armadillos tolypeutes rely heavily on their armor for protection when threatened by a predator tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates the north american nine banded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised and consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles armadillos have short legs but can move quickly and have the ability to remain underwater for as long as six minutes because of the weight of its armor an armadillo will sink in water unless it inflates its stomach with air which often doubles its size armadillos use their claws for digging and finding food as well as for making their homes they build their houses with the claws only making a single corridor where they fit themselves systematics order cingulata family pampatheriidae giant armadillos prehistoric family glyptodontidae glyptodonts prehistoric genus glyptodon genus

the few known non human animal species that can contract the disease systemically they are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium wild armadillos can carry leprosy but transmission to humans is rare the nine banded armadillo also serves science through its unusual reproductive system in which four identical quadruplets all the same sex are born in each litter because they are always identical the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific behavioral or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects this phenomenon of multiple identical birth called polyembryony only manifests in the genus dasypus and not in all armadillos as is commonly believed in popular culture armadillo is spanish for little armored one referring to their outer skin that looks like armor during the great depression this species was known as hoover hog by down on their luck americans who had to eat them instead of the chicken in every pot herbert hoover had promised as president earlier german settlers in texas would often refer to the armadillo as panzerschwein armored pig the

 id=240489 title gekigangar iii nonfiltered 363 processed 356 dbindex 1560365 is a meta anime of the anime series martian successor nadesico that plays a critical part in the plot thereof initially only gai daigoji and akito tenkawa are depicted as enjoying the series later in the series hikaru amano becomes the other resident anime fanatic story many years ago the super paleolithic empire resided at some point on earth and foresaw the coming of the kyo akk empire s troops from the dark string universe as a defence measure they left behind designs for a super robot in a cave deep beneath the earth in the form of a rock carving years later professor kokubunji and a team of archaeologists which included some students found this cave and using these designs built the super robot gekigangar iii it was to be piloted by three students tenku ken umitsubame joe and daichi akira each one of them pilots one of the three lesser machines gekigan jet gekigan marine and gekigan tank respectively that combine into one of three different forms depending on their configuration whoever pilots the head section is usually the one in dominant control the most powerful form gekigangar iii is formed with jet as the head and torso marine as its waist and upper legs and tank as its lower legs this form specializes in air combat umigangar the fastest yet weakest form is formed with marine as the head and torso tank as the waist and jet as the legs it is most proficient in undersea combat or any situation in which speed is a necessity rikugangar the slowest yet strongest form is created with tank at the head and torso jet as the waist and marine as the legs this form is used when superior firepower or melee strength is needed eventually the kyo akk empire s demonic mecha monsters attack at the order of emperor hyperion the evil prince akara with his own super robot the big akara special leads them in battle together with his sidekick mii e mii e who is hopelessly in love with him and so the constant war wages with the gekigangar team fighting more and more unusual mecha monsters every episode and the group facing other challenges in their personal lives outside of the combat for example ken and nanako professor kokubunji s granddaughter seem to have feelings for each other at the start of the series later on it is seen that nanako falls in love with joe at first ken and joe find it hard to tolerate one another s company and eventually exchange fisticuffs on the beach after another fight against the kyo akk when they compliment each other on their fighting skills they stop fighting and develop a friendship in one episode joe finds out that he s actually an alien from another civilization when he and the team go up against another robot sent by the dark string universe the pilot of this robot sapphire used to be a part of that civilization until it was conquered by the kyo akk she falls in love with joe during the course of the episode and eventually self destructs rather than destroying gekigangar as was ordered so that joe may live in another episode prince akara disguised as school student akara ginji enrolls into the gekigangar iii team s school and discovers that humans have emotions and know how to love in this same episode mii e mii e attacks the city with another monster hidden by akara which results in her death at the hands of gekigangar akara now realising his love for her vows revenge upon ken and gekigangar in the next episode after a dramatic duel between the two he is killed one of the most quoted lines in nadesico from gekigangar is spoken here by ken had we been born at another time or place we may have been friends come episode 27 the kyo akk army has been taken over by general masaka he succeeds in heavily damaging gekigangar to a great extent his final attack impales the mecha through the waist directly through joe s cockpit and him with his final breath joe orders ken to use gekigan flare which defeats masaka in the episode s final scene ken is seen holding joe in his arms both he and akira weeping in mourning with the setting sun behind them a faint image of joe is seen on the horizon showing the viewer that he will always be alive in spirit with gekigangar heavily damaged and one of the team members lost it is dangerous to linger as the kyo akk forces make their advance with the newly built gekigangar v and a new pilot ryuzaki tetsuya they continue to show that justice and passion prevail over all gekigangar within nadesico as nadesico progresses we find that the very reason the jovians who are really humans are attacking earth is because they believe their cause to be just and they idolize the gekigangar anime series toward the end even captain yurika is a gekigangar otaku in the end the gekigangar series becomes a lesson on why people should not assimilate fictional stories into their moral code a lot of violence and death occurs as a result of the jovian s adaptation of the series into their society and their leader s attempts to preserve this adapted moral code it should be noted that the jovians did not actually see the entire series they missed the episode which had joe reappear with no reason given for his apparent revival akito feels this episode breaks the series because of this corny plot twist spelling it is often debated how gekigangar is actually spelled in the series many times is it seen on posters or otherwise as gekiganger despite the kana for the title saying ge ki ga n gaa both the ger and the gar sound are represented with the kana for ga with the horizontal stroke added to lengthen the syllable trivia the various gekigangar clips that were shown throughout the nadesico series were later compiled together into an ova the title gekigangar is a parody name with gekiga and er combined meaning people of from serious manga gekigangar created as a parody of the early super robot genre shares a great many similarities to some of the most well known titles from that era at the onset of the series gekigangar iii is almost a clone of go nagai s getter robo the combination of the three machines into three different robots is the most obvious testament to that effect each main character also follows the visual and personal archetype of a character from getter robo the death of joe and subsequent recruitment of tetsuya runs parallel to the events at the end of getter robo and the beginning of getter robo g they replacing tomoe musashi and kuruma benkei respectively after this gekigangar is redubbed gekigangar v an homage to two of the three works in nagahama tadao s romance robot trilogy combattler v and voltes v similarly many of gekigangar s attacks are synonymous with other famous super robot special moves such as gekigan punch rocket punch mazinger z gekigan cutters devil cutter devilman gekigan beam kyoshiroku beam mazinger z gekigan flare shine spark getter robo g prince akira s shock over the fact that human s apparently know of love and emotion is a play on the idea of protoculture from macross wherein the alien invaders were physicaly repulsed by such actions and were actively driven to distraction by it the character name tenku ken is s pun on the martial art as well as the name of voltes v s sword umitsubame from joe s name means sea swallow similarly daichi from daichi akira means earth ryuzaki tetsuya is a combination of the names of two super robot pilots ryuzaki kazuya from toushou daimos and tetsuya tsurugi from great mazinger let s gekiga in is a play on let s volt in from

 id=178206 title progress spacecraft nonfiltered 366 processed 359 dbindex 1560368 the progress is a russian expendable freighter spacecraft the spacecraft is unmanned during its flight but upon docking with a spacestation it allows astronauts inside hence it is classified manned by the manufacturer it was derived from the soyuz spacecraft and is launched with the soyuz launch vehicle it is currently used to supply the international space station but was originally used to supply russian space stations for many years there are three to four flights of the progress spacecraft to the iss per year each spacecraft remains docked until shortly before the new one arrives then it is filled with waste disconnected deorbited and destroyed in the atmosphere it has carried fuel and other supplies to all the space stations since salyut 6 the idea for the progress came from the realisation that in order for long duration space missions to be possible there would have to be constant source of supplies it had been determined that a cosmonaut needed 30 kg of consumables a day this equates to 5 4 tonnes over a six month stay it was impractical to launch this along with passengers in the small space available in the soyuz design progress is of much the same size and shape as soyuz it consists of three modules a pressurised forward module this carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment clothes prepackaged and fresh food and letters from home the docking drogue is similar to that of the soyuz but features ducting for the udmh fuel and n2o4 oxidiser a fuel compartment the reentry module of the soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft this meant that if a leak occurred the poisonous gas would not enter the station s atmosphere the fuel is carried in two tanks a propulsion module the propulsion module at the rear of the spacecraft remained unchanged and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking it may be used to boost the orbit of the station once docked reduction in weight was possible because the progress was designed to be unmanned and disposable this means that there is no need for bulky life support systems and heat shields the spacecraft also has no ability to split into separate modules after undocking the spacecraft performs a retrofiring and burns up in the atmosphere versions there were many small variations between the different flights but the major upgrades are reflected in the change of name progress there were 42 spacecraft under the name progress the last one being launched in may 1990 the bureau in charge of designing the freighter was tskbem now rkk energia they began work on the design in mid 1973 assigning progress the rather cryptic designation 11f615a15 the design was complete by february 1974 and the first production model was ready for launch in november 1977 progress 1 launched on january 20 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the soyuz it still featured the same launch shroud as the soyuz though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the launch escape system had been deactivated this first version of progress had a mass of 7 020 kg and carried 2 300 kg of cargo or 30 of its launch weight it had the same diameter as the soyuz at 2 2 metres but was 8 metres in length slightly longer the autonomous flight time was 3 days the same time as that of the soyuz ferry it could spend one month docked progress always docked to the aft port of the station it was resupplying launch weight 7 020 7 249 kg weight of cargo progress 1 24 2 300 kg weight of cargo progress 24 42 2 500 kg length 7 94 m diameter of cargo modules 2 2 m maximum diameter 2 72 m volume of cargo compartment 6 6 m³ progress m the upgrade progress m was first launched in august 1989 the first 43 flights all went to mir following mir s re entry there have been about 14 flights to the international space station and more are scheduled the progress m is essentially the same spacecraft as the progress but it features improvements from the soyuz t and tm it can spend up to 30 days in autonomous flight and is able to carry 100 kg more to mir also unlike the old progress crafts it can return items to earth this is accomplished by using the raduga capsule which can carry up to 150 kg of cargo it is 1 5 m long and 60 cm in diameter and has a dry weight of 350 kg progress m can dock to the forward port of the station and still transfer fuel it uses the same rendezvous system as the soyuz and it features solar panels for the first time launch weight 7 130 kg cargo weight 2 600 kg dry cargo weight 1 500 kg liquid cargo weight 1 540 kg length 7 23 m solar array span 10 6 m dry cargo compartment volume 7 6 m³ diameter of cargo modules 2 2 m maximum diameter 2 72 m progress m1 progress m1 was another variant capable of carrying more propellant but less total cargo to the stations there have been 11 of these flights mass 7 150 kg capacity cargo 2 230 kg capacity propellant 1 950 kg capacity dry cargo 1 800 kg progress m2 progress m2 was another variant which was a proposed design for the proposed mir 2 space station but was dropped due to financial issues the m2 variant would have a larger service module for larger cargo or space station modules and would have been launched on a zenit launch vehicle current status this spacecraft is still in use today for the international space station between february 1 2003 and july 26 2005 it was the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station as the space shuttle fleet was grounded after the breakup of the columbia at the end of sts 107 for iss missions the progress m1 variant is used which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section and as a result is able to carry more propellant like the soyuz and unlike most american space ships the progress has an autonomous navigation system that usually allows for automatic docking with the space station it can be manually overridden if necessary the european space agency esa is planning its own supply freighter called the automated transfer vehicle the first of these the jules verne is due for launch in mid 2007 it will be able to carry up to 7 5 tonnes of cargo into space roughly three times as much as the progress and will be launched every 12 months by an ariane 5 rocket the new crew exploration vehicle which will replace the space shuttle after 2010 will have like progress two unmanned variations one version will retain the pressurized crew module but will be outfitted with storage lockers that can allow astronauts to bring fresh equipment onboard along with being able to return experiments to earth another version with the crew module replaced with a docking ring on an enlarged service module will allow the iss to be boosted into a higher 350 mi orbit allowing the iss to avoid most of the atmosphere and reducing the need to reboost the station on a regular basis rkk energia has proposed as a replacement for the progress spacecraft a new spacecraft by the name of parom which means ferry in russian this new spacecraft would retrieve either the proposed kliper or any other cargo container with a russian airlock up to 15 tons back to the

ever since then the party s secretary has been daniele capezzone replaced by rita bernardini in 2006 the party intends to be italy s national incarnation of the transnational radical party that is the continuation of the radical party founded in 1955 by the left wing of italian liberal party relaunched in the 60s by marco pannella and transformed into the transnational radical party in 1989

italian radicals radicali italiani in 2001 alliances the radical party had historically been considered a leftist political movement when italian media tycoon silvio berlusconi entered the political arena in 1994 radicals decided to support his policies albeit critically and without becoming directly involved in his governmental cabinets in the hope of a liberal revolution consequently some regarded them as being a right wing movement however since the late 90s radicals have not been part of any major coalition typically radicals are viewed as leftist by right wing people and rightist by left wing people during the spring 2005 electoral campaign the italian radicals took the unprecedented step of asking at the same time formal recognition from and acceptance into both major coalitions the right wing house of freedoms and the left wing union regardless of their respective political platforms the italian radicals request was turned down by both coalitions on november 17 2005 the italian radicals established an alliance with the italian democratic socialists and formed a new and wider secular socialist liberal radical movement that should be part of the left wing coalition l

however they have been in favour of military interventions in kosovo they are staunchly pro american and are in favour of more freedom in the market among the current party campaigns are the following support of civil unions abolition of the concordato the treaty between italy and the vatican perceived to be too favourable to the latter in economic and institutional terms legalization of soft drugs

through support by the soviets prevention james bond with the help of female special branch agent gala brand sabotaged drax s moonraker missile launch and changed the coordinates of the target back to

and female that would leave earth on six shuttles the one just stolen from nasa to replace one that had faults and have sanctuary on a space station in orbit over earth using chemical weapons created by drax s scientists derived from the toxin of a rare south american plant the black orchid at an installation in italy he would wipe out the remainder of humanity the biological agents were to be dispersed around the earth from a series of 50 strategically placed globes each containing enough toxin to kill 100 million people only three globes had been launched when the station was destroyed taking with it the threat from the other 47 globes bond and goodhead escape the destruction of the space station in drax s own shuttle and bond uses laser guns mounted on the shuttle to destroy the remaining three globes after a period of time when the chemical agents no longer had any effect drax and his master race would return to earth to reinhabit the planet these humans would supposedly live in harmony with one another under his command bond obtained a sample of the chemical agent at the location in italy and analysis of it led him to a remote part of brazil where he found drax s

otherwise tegan feels ill so marriner escorts her to a room which she soon realizes is a mixture of her room in the tardis and her rooms in brisbane they have been reading her mind marriner seems quite taken by tegan finding her mind fascinating and full of life in conversation with striker the doctor finds out that eternals use ephemerals for their thoughts and ideas the eternals have lived for so long that they are unable to think for themselves and need human minds to give them existence and entertainment that is why the ships use human crews the purpose of the race however is more than entertainment the prize is enlightenment the wisdom to know everything the tardis is discovered by the eternals who make it vanish trapped on board the edwardian ship for the moment the doctor and his companions go on board deck in space suits turlough hears the voice of the black guardian taunting him and unable to take the strain he leaps overboard into space turlough is rescued by the buccaneer the pirate ship commanded by captain wrack she toys with turlough sadistically with a knife but he manages to convince her that he jumped overboard to throw in his lot with her to find out the secret of how she will win the race wrack sends her first mate to present captain davey one of the other competitors with a jewelled sword and to deliver party invitations to the other captains on board the edwardian ship striker refuses the invitation but the doctor accepts wanting to retrieve turlough marriner offers to escort tegan and the doctor to the buccaneer as an asteroid storm hits the ships as davey s ship draws level with the buccaneer wrack takes turlough down in the hold and shows him the entrance to a locked chamber with a vacuum shield but leaves him outside when she enters through the door however turlough hears the voice of the black guardian as davey s ship explodes apparently hit by an asteroid the doctor though again suspects otherwise especially since like critas s ship davey was also challenging the buccaneer arriving on board the buccaneer for the party the doctor and tegan mingle while turlough sneaks off to examine the locked chamber he finds an eye shaped grid open to space but a pirate locks the door and turns off the vacuum shield fortunately the doctor finds turlough before he suffocates the doctor then notices the eye shaped projector above the grid and theorizes that this must be how wrack transmits the power to destroy the other ships using some sort of focus he remembers critas was wearing an out of period clasp with a red crystal and turlough tells him of wrack s gift to davey and the doctor realizes the red crystal is the focus before they can act on it however they are captured by wrack s first mate meanwhile wrack has managed to lure tegan away from the party to her wheelhouse and freezes her in time while she plants a red crystal in her tiara brought before wrack turlough accuses the doctor of being a spy and claims he was trying to capture the doctor wrack sends the doctor tegan and marriner back to the edwardian ship the doctor believes that turlough is trying to prove himself trustworthy by stopping wrack unfortunately wrack sees into turlough s mind and is about to sentence him to walk to plank she pauses however when turlough tells her that he too serves the black guardian as the ships near the crystalline space station of the enlighteners the buccaneer pulls level with the edwardian ship and wrack brings turlough once again to the chamber this time letting him witness her summoning the power of the black guardian the doctor seeing the buccaneer pull close realizes that the focus must have been smuggled aboard somehow and as he describes it tegan tells him about the crystal in the tiara the doctor smashes the crystal but only manages to multiply the power by the number of fragments the doctor gathers up the pieces rushing up to the deck and just in time hurls them overboard as they explode suddenly the wind dies and wrack pulls ahead of the edwardian ship the doctor demands that the tardis be released to him to stop wrack from winning and marriner reveals that it was concealed within the doctor s own mind travelling in it to the buccaneer the doctor tries to reason with wrack but her first mate shows up with turlough and she orders that the doctor be thrown into space as tegan watches from the edwardian ship two bodies are ejected into space and the buccaneer reaches the finish the human crew of the buccaneer vanish as tegan striker and marriner board to give their respects to the victor the enlighteners turn out to be the black and white guardians and the winner is the doctor who brought the ship in with turlough s help when wrack and her first mate met with an accident the doctor however refuses the diamond crystal containing enlightenment saying that he s not ready for it and the white guardian dismisses striker and marriner who vanish back into eternity as turlough helped the doctor bring the ship in he is entitled to a portion of the prize the black guardian reminds turlough of their bargain and says that he can give up the diamond or sacrifice the doctor to gain both enlightenment and the tardis turlough struggles with a decision and hurls the diamond at the black guardian who vanishes in screams and flames the doctor points out that enlightenment was not the diamond but the choice itself the white guardian warns once again that the black guardian will return even angrier now that he has been thwarted twice and vanishes

range from the 7th to 4th centuries bc he is most famous for his sanskrit grammar particularly for his formulation of the 3 959 rules of sanskrit morphology in the grammar known as meaning eight chapters it is the earliest known grammar of sanskrit though scholars agree it likely built on earlier works and the earliest known work on descriptive linguistics generative linguistics and perhaps linguistics as a whole panini s comprehensive and scientific theory of grammar is conventionally taken to mark the end of the period of vedic sanskrit by definition introducing classical sanskrit dating nothing definite is known about s life not even the century he lived in he lived almost certainly after the 7th and before the 4th century bc according to tradition he was born in shalatula punjab a town beside the indus river in gandhara which is near modern day peshawar nwfp of pakistan and lived circa 520 460 bc his grammar defines classical sanskrit so that per definition lived at the end of the vedic period he notes a few special rules marked in the hymns to account for forms in the vedic scriptures that had fallen out of use in the spoken language of his time indicating that vedic sanskrit was already archaic but still a comprehensible dialect an important hint for the dating of is the occurrence of the word in 4 1 49 either greek woman or greek script there would have been no first hand knowledge of greeks in gandhara before the conquests of alexander the great in the 330s bc but it is likely that the name was known via old persian yauna so that may well have lived as early as the time of darius the great ruled 521 bc 485 6 bc though when alexander entered india there were existing greek settlements as mentioned by plutarch in his lives and there may have even been a trading route between the two areas which accounts for the introduction of certain herbs in both the most ancient ayurvedic and greek materia medica writing it is not certain whether used writing for the composition of his work though it is generally agreed that he did use a form of writing based on references to words such as script and scribe in his ashtadhyayi it is believed that a work of such complexity would have been very difficult to compile without written notes though some have argued that he might have composed it with the help of a group of students whose memories served him as notepads writing first reappears in india since the indus script in the form of the br hm script from at least the 6th century bc though these early instances of the br hm script are from tamil nadu in southern india quite distant from gandhara in northwestern india however gandhara was under persian rule in the 6th century bc so it s also possible that he used the aramaic alphabet from which the br hm script may have descended work s grammar of sanskrit consists of the following four parts shiva sutras phonology ashtadhyayi morphology dhatupatha lists classes verbal roots ganapatha lists classes of primitive nominal stems the shiva sutras are a brief but highly organized list of phonemes the dhatupatha and ganapatha are lexical lists the former of verbal roots sorted by present class the latter a list of nominal stems grouped by common properties the central part and by far the most complex is the ashtadhyayi which takes material from the lexical lists as

the morpheme and the root only recognized by western linguists some two millennia later his rules have a reputation for perfection that is they are claimed to describe sanskrit morphology fully without any redundancy a consequence of his grammar s focus on brevity is its highly unintuitive structure reminiscent of contemporary machine language as opposed to human readable programming languages his sophisticated logical rules and technique have been widely influential in ancient and modern linguistics the commentary on panini s grammar mah bh ya after panini the mah bh ya great commentary of patañjali on the celebrated ashtadhyayi is one of the three most famous works in sanskrit grammar it was with patañjali that indian linguistic science reached its definite form the system thus established is extremely detailed as to shiksha phonology including accent and vyakarana morphology syntax is scarcely touched but nirukta etymology is discussed and these etymologies naturally lead to semantic explanations people interpret his work to be a defense of panini whose s tras are elaborated meaningfully he also attacks k ty yana rather severely but the main contributions of patañjali lies in the treatment of the principles of grammar enunciated by him panini and modern linguistics thus and the later indian linguist bhartrihari had a significant influence on many of the foundational ideas proposed by ferdinand de saussure professor of sanskrit who is widely considered the father of modern structural linguistics noam chomsky has always acknowledged his debt to for his modern notion of an explicit generative grammar in optimality theory the hypothesis about the relation between specific and general constraints is known as panini s theorem on constraint ranking paninian grammars have also been devised for non sanskrit languages his work was the forerunner to modern formal language theory mathematical linguistics and formal grammar and a precursor to computing panini and modern computing s use of metarules transformations and recursion together make his grammar as rigorous as a modern turing machine in this sense may be considered the father of computing machines the backus naur form panini backus form or bnf grammars used to describe modern programming languages have significant similarities to grammar rules panini s vocabulary

major king s attorney settler the first of the d entremonts of nova scotia he was born in normandy probably at cherbourg france and died in acadia nova scotia canada according to placide gaudet the norman philippe mius was related by marriage to the house of bourbon and was made sieur d entremont by louis xiv but according to a descendant h léandre d entremont the titles of nobility are said to go back to the 11th century in savoy and a branch of the savoy family is thought to have emigrated to normandy during the 16th century in 1649 the sieur d entremont married madeleine hélie or élie du

the new governor charles de saint étienne de la tour a childhood friend as lieutenant major and commander of the king s troops to reward him for his services la tour offered d entremont in 1651 or 1653 the letters patent of the pobomcoup fief as a barony the feudal rights conferred upon the baron a territory stretching from cap nègre to cap fourchu yarmouth the feudal castle was built near the entry to the natural harbour of pubnico on the east side d entremont played an important part in the colony s history both because of what he did as an administrator and because he was one of the rare acadian seigneurs to concern himself with cultivation and with clearing land he attracted to his estate several indentured workers and a few families from port royal annapolis royal n s and this seigneury eventually formed a small centre of population besides their daughter marie marguerite d entremont whom they had brought from france the d entremonts had four children who were born on

seigneurial estate bequeathing the title of baron to his eldest son jacques and went to settle at port royal with his wife and two of his children he died at the end of 1700 or the beginning of 1701 a venerable patriarch more than 90 years old according to tradition it was at port royal that he died but léandre d entremont indicates grand pré where d entremont may have gone to reside with his daughter marie marguerite melancon as the more likely place of death philippe mius d entremont has left a large number of descendants in acadia the barony of pobomcoup remained in the family until the

sanjay the market trader had an eye for the ladies and a weakness for gambling he was always full of big ideas and get rich quick schemes which never worked background sanjay was first seen in albert square in february 1993 he was an old friend of the market inspector richard cole and he came to persuade him to bend the rules and give him a pitch in the market for his clothing stall richard agreed and gave him rachel kominski s permanent pitch much to her dismay sanjay a hindu was married to gita kapoor and at the time of his arrival she was heavily pregnant with their first child which was due in march 1993 they had been living separately since the failure of their previous business and sanjay needed to find a place for them to live sanjay had a weakness for gambling a fact that richard was all too aware of and he immediately tempted him with a late night poker game sanjay got himself into trouble when he gambled away the deposit money he was due to spend on a flat this meant that sanjay and gita had to lodge with richard for a while at number 13 turpin road over the bookies until they could find another flat understandably gita was not pleased eventually sanjay via more gambling managed to get some money together and put down a deposit on flat number 43b albert square that same day gita went into labour giving birth to a little girl who they named sharmilla sanjay was always out to make a quick buck and it wasn t long before he d gotten himself into trouble with the trading standards for selling fake designer labels on his cothing stall gita would despair over all sanjay s money making schemes as invariably they all ended in disaster adultery sanjay had never gotten along with gita s sister meena mckenzie meena was bossy snooty domineering and she had always looked down on sanjay so sanjay was none too pleased when she turned up on their doorstep in july that year announcing her intention to stay she immediately caused friction between sanjay and gita with her constant criticism and bitching and it wasn t long before sanjay had kicked her out however despite this meena was a regular visitor to square often spying on sanjay and informing gita about his troublesome exploits which usually involved gambling and the like gita had began to get extremely wary of sanjay s dishonest behaviour particularly when she discovered a restaurant receipt in his pocket for a champagne meal for two to make matters worse she was suffering with severe post natal depression and her and sanjay were involved in regular shouting matches which only sought to drive sanjay further away by the end of the year gita had convinced herself that sanjay was having an affair and the women she suspected was michelle fowler she decided to confront michelle and furiously told her to keep away from her husband bizzarrely meena who was always the first to criticise sanjay leapt to his defence and desperately tried to convinve gita that she was imagining his infidelity gita was consoled by her sister and decided that she needed a break so in december that year she decided to leave sharmilla with sanjay to go and stay with relatives sanjay was hopeless at tending for his baby and instantly called meena to come and stay so she could help him out early in january gita arrived home late at night much earlier than expected as she crept into the flat to check on sharmilla she was shocked by the sight that greeted her sanjay and meena laying naked and asleep in her bed she suddenly realised that it was meena sanjay had been sleeping with all along disgusted and hurt she grabbed sharmilla and left when sanjay awoke and realised sharmilla was missing he immediately guessed that gita had discovered the affair he went into a panic and they agreed to pretend that last night was their only time together and as they were so drunk nothing untoward happened anyway gita however didn t believe a word of it and after throwing a tirade of abuse at them she threw them both out of the flat first gita refused sanjay access to their stall leaving him with no money and constant rowing broke out into violence and gita then decided she wasn t going to allow sanjay access to his daughter either more problems arose when gita informed meena s husband jerry mckenzie about the affair after much insults and provocation from jerry an enraged sanjay finally aditted that he d been sleeping with meena for months 3 or 4 nights a week when gita discovered that sanjay would have rights to see his daughter she took her child and left walford reconciliation a few months later she returned and took possession of the flat again she and sanjay started sharing the work on the stall and the care of sharmilla this led sanjay to think that it would only be a matter of time before he and gita would be back together however with meena still visiting gita in an effort to be reconciled with her it was not proving to be easy later in the year gita became the target of a racist attack her door was graffitied and she even had dog feaces posted through her letter box after her window was smashed in and a swastika was painted on her door gita started to panic and turned to sanjay for help sanjay was furious that his wife was being subjected to such vile racism and he became hell bent on uncovering the people who were doing it he eventually managed to catch the perpetrators in the act a gang of vicious yobs he managed to grab hold of one and started to punch him to the ground just when a police car pulled up sanjay was then arrested while the yob escaped after a night in a cell he was eventually released with a caution the incident appeared to stir some worry in gita and on christmas day they eventually reconciled and spent the night together however gita was quick to remind sanjay that their night of passion was just about sex and she refused to get back with him despite his pleas during 1995 gita and sanjay continued to meet up regularly for sex and eventually gita was persuaded to give their marriage another shot and she allowed sanjay to move back in in september of that year sanjay was forced to return to india to tend to his dying grandfather this left gita to get friendly with a business associate called guppy it turned out that guppy was actually meena s finace sent by her to put business to the kapoor s in a last ditch attempt to patch up with her sister however this backfired when guppy tried it on with gita and upon sanjay s return he immediately assumed gita was sleeping with him gita eventually put him straight and in 1996 guppy managed to persuade him to invest 2000 in a dodgy business venture however guppy was just a conman and after getting hold of the money he disappeared leaving sanjay to face up to a furious gita sanjay had borrowed the money from a loan shark and was now forced to repay extortionate amounts of interest on the loan gita had to sort out the mess she paid off the loan in one go but was forced to compensate the loan shark for his potential loss of interest later in the year sanjay decided that he wanted to extend the family and so he started putting pressure on gita to have another child but no matter how hard they tried they couldn t conceive a worried sanjay then instructed gita to go to the doctors to ascertain what was wrong even though sanjay had assumed that the problem lay with gita it was eventually discovered that the problem lay with him as he had a low sperm count this made sanjay question his manhood and he spent several weeks wallowing in exaggerated misery over his wounded male pride this caused a lot of arguments between the kapoors but things were about to get a lot worse for sanjay when he discovered that his father had died and he was forced to return to india for yet another funeral he returned in march 1997 and to gita s horror he had brought his mother neelam home to live with them neelam s traditional views often clashed with those of her westernised daughter in law and sanjay was often in the middle of their spats to make matters worse sanjay was forced to admit to his mother that he d lost her clothing business years earlier and his fashion empire was merely a clothing stall on the local market meanwhile gita and sanjay still desperate for a baby decided to try ivf treatment unfortunately this failed and as each ivf session cost 3000 they could no longer afford the treatment as the year wore on gita became more and more annoyed by neelam s interference and she and sanjay began to bicker constantly in october of that year gita announced she was going away for a few days to stay with her sister where s gita however gita did not return in a few days and she kept putting her return off meanwhile sanjay was enjoying his freedom and he spent his time drinking gambling and flirting with women in january 1998 gita and sharmilla were finally due to arrive home however a dodgy business proposition concerning stolen clothing made sanjay late for their rendezvous at the train station and when he finally arrived gita was nowhere to be seen days went by and still there was no sign of gita so sanjay was forced to contact the police however it soon became clear that police suspected that sanjay may have had something to do with her disappearance they set about questioning everyone on the square about sanjay and built up a less than flattering picture of a feeble womaniser who was infertile under the thumb and prone to aggressive outburts towards his wife next the police noticed blood on the door of sanjay s van and seemed sceptical when he assured them it was his own blood their theory was proved to be correct when dna tests confirmed that the blood matched gita s type and not sanjay s to make matters worse a bloody shirt the same colour as the one gita was wearing the day of her disappearance was found in the back of his van sanjay was then arrested on suspicion of murder the police seemed to have a strong case they had statements to show that sanjay had left walford earlier than he initially told them and they had a video of a man that could have been sanjay meeting a woman that could have been gita at the train station sanjay then admitted that the reason he was late was because he was purchasing stolen goods to sell and he had gotten into an altercation with the seller hence the bloody shirt this was all a bit too coincidental for the police s liking however sanjay s solicitor managed to get him relaesed and told him they had no real evidence and were merely holding him in the hope that he would confess eventually the police confirmed that the blood wasn t either gita s or sharmilla s and so sanjay was in the clear with gita missing sanjay spent the rest of the year gambling and drinking himself into a stuper and he eventually came to accept that gita and his daughter were probably dead however in july that year a very much alive gita contacted her friend on the square ruth fowler she was in desperate need of money and needed her help although she made her promise not to inform sanjay that she d called ruth tried to get the money together but when her husband mark fowler discovered what was going on he went to inform sanjay sanjay went livid and made ruth promise to take him with her to meet gita they went to birmingham where she was staying but were shocked to discover that a woman fitting gita s description had been taken away in an ambulance the night before they went straight to the hospital and were shocked to discover gita there carrying a new born baby in her arms she divulged that she had fallen pregnant after a one night stand and instead of returning to face sanjay she had run away the father had since abandoned her and now she was all alone sanjay was furious but after much sole searching he decided that he could be a loving father to her new child arjun and he eventually decided to give their relationship another go this didn t sit well with neelam who couldn t forgive her daughter in law s infidelity and she decided to go back to india soon after gita s return disowing sanjay on her way out sanjay and gita were happy for a while until the local reporter polly becker discovered their recent scandal after secretly taping confessions from both sanjay and ruth she wrote their shocking story and it was published in the walford gazzette suddenly the whole of walford knew what had transpired in gita s absence from then on both sanjay and gita were hounded by reporters and sharmilla began to get bullied at school the kapoor s then decided that the only option was to leave walford to start again somewhere else their last appearance was in september 1998 family mother neelam kapoor wife gita kapoor daughter

 id=1613106 title history of derry nonfiltered 519 processed 511 dbindex 1560523 derry is one of the longest continuously inhabited places in ireland the earliest historical references date to the sixth century when a monastery was founded there but for thousands of years before that people had been living in the vicinity these people left traces of their existence in the various archaeological sites and objects which often come to light in this area early history in the 6th century a christian monastery was founded on the hill of doire to the east of the river foyle the site was allegedly granted by a local king who had a fortress there a similar kind of fortress can be seen at the spectacular gríanán of aileach a few miles west of the city in county donegal according to legend the monastery of doire was established by the great irish saint colmcille columba 521 597 colmcille founded many important monasteries in ireland and scotland including durrow in the irish midlands and iona on an island off the west of scotland the claim that he founded a settlement at doire is less certain although that monastery definitely belonged to the federation of columban churches which looked to colmcille as their spiritual founder and leader the monastery of doire would have been quite small at the beginning the location of the first church was probably where the beautiful little church of ireland chapel of st augustine stands today during the later middle ages the old monastery of derry evolved into an augustinian congregation the church of that monastery survived up to the seventeenth century and was used as their first place of worship by the london colonists who came here to build the walled city although the vikings certainly sailed up the loughs and rivers of this area the monastery of derry escaped the worst effects of their raids doire s medieval heydays were in the 12th centuries and 13th centuries when the local mac lochlainn dynasty moved into the settlement under their patronage derry prospered the population grew the monastery and its school thrived and prestigious buildings were erected with the decline of the mac lochlainns some of whom claimed to be kings of all ireland derry also sank into unimportance plantation of ulster throughout the second half of the 16th century queen elizabeth i s military leaders tried to conquer the province of ulster the only part of ireland still outside english control the english first came to derry in 1566 but the garrison established there at that time lasted only a few years a second more successful garrison returned in 1600 during the nine years war against the gaelic o neill and o donnell earls on this occasion the english managed to hold on to derry and when the war came to an end in 1603 a small trading settlement was established and given the legal status of city in 1608 this infant city was attacked by cahir o doherty irish chieftain of inishowen and the settlement was virtually wiped out this attack came about shortly after the flight of the earls when the o neill and o donnell chieftains together with their principal supporters fled to the continent leaving gaelic ulster leaderless the new king in london james i decided on a revolutionary plan designed once and for all to subordinate ulster the plantation of ulster required the colonising of the area by loyal english and scottish migrants who were to be protestant in religion unlike the catholic natives one part of this colonisation was to be organized by the ancient and wealthy livery companies of the city of london the new county granted to the londoners and its fortified city built across the river foyle from the recently destroyed settlement were renamed londonderry in honour of this association the usage of derry versus londonderry is still controversial the city of londonderry was the jewel in the crown of the ulster plantation it was laid out according to the best contemporary principles of town planning imported from the continent the original street lay out has survived to the present almost intact more importantly the city was enclosed by massive stone and earthen fortifications at the time it was the largest planned settlement in the british isles it was the last walled city built in ireland and the only city on the island whose ancient walls survive complete among the city s new buildings was st columb s cathedral 1633 this is one of the most important seventeenth century buildings in the country and was the first specifically protestant cathedral erected anywhere in the world following the reformation civil wars and sieges the new city was slow to prosper by the 1680s it still had only about 2 000 inhabitants and yet it was by far the largest town in ulster along with most parts of britain and ireland the city suffered from the upheavals in the 1640s this began with the irish rebellion of 1641 when the gaelic irish insurgents made a failed attack on the city for the next ten years of war derry and its environs became a stronghold for the british protestant settlers who raised the lagan army to defend themselves from the irish confederates however the protestants were disunited about how to respond to the events of the english civil war with some of them supporting the king some the english parliament and some the scottish covenanters in 1649 the city and its garrison which supported the republican parliament in london were besieged by scottish presbyterian forces loyal to king charles i the parliamentarians besieged in derry were relieved by a strange alliance of roundhead troops under george monck and the irish catholic general owen roe o neill these temporary allies were soon fighting each other again however after the landing in ireland of the new model army in 1649 the war in ulster was finally brought to an end when the parliamentarians crushed the irish catholic ulster army at the battle of scarrifholis in nearby donegal in 1650 among derry s most famous citizens in the second half of the seventeenth century was george farquhar one of the so called restoration dramatists in 1688 ireland became the battleground for the glorious revolution in england when james ii was deposed by william of orange catholic ireland strongly supported james but many protestants in ulster secretly supported william james ii had his catholic viceroy richard talbot 1st earl of tyrconnell take action to ensure that all strong points in ireland were held by garrisons loyal to the jacobite cause by november 1688 only the walled city of londonderry and nearby enniskillen had a protestant garrison an army of around 1 200 men mostly redshanks highlanders under alexander macdonnell 3rd earl of antrim was slowly organised they set out on the week william of orange landed in england when they arrived on 7 december 1688 the gates were closed against them and the siege of derry began on april 18 1689 while his attempts to regain his throne in what became the williamite war in ireland with the jacobites got under way king james came to the city and summoned it to surrender the king was rebuffed and actually fired at by some of the more determined defenders tradition has the apprentice boys closing the gates and saving the city as a policy of no surrender was confirmed the jacobite forces outside the city began the famous siege of derry for 105 days the city suffered appalling conditions as cannonballs and mortar bombs rained down and famine and disease took their terrible toll conditions for the besiegers were no better and many thousands of people died both inside and outside the walls the cannon used to defend the city can be seen on the walls and at other places around the city finally at the end of july a relief ship broke the barricading boom which had been stretched across the river near where the new foyle bridge now stands the siege was over but it has left its mark on the traditions of the city to the present day see apprentice boys of derry 18th and 19th centuries the city was rebuilt in the 18th century with many of its fine georgian style houses still surviving george berkeley ireland s most important philosopher was dean of londonderry 1724 33 and another well known and eccentric cleric frederick augustus hervey 4th earl of bristol was bishop of londonderry 1768 1803 it was hervey the so called earl bishop who was responsible for building the city s first bridge across the river foyle in 1790 during the 18th and 19th centuries the port became an important embarkation point for irish emigrants setting out for north america some of these founded the colonies of derry and londonderry in the state of new hampshire by the middle of the nineteenth century a thriving shirt and collarmaking industry had been established here giving the city many of its fine industrial buildings four separate railway networks emanated from the city the interesting history of which can be examined at the foyle valley railway centre the city became a university city when its magee college was incorporated into the royal university of ireland in 1880 magee college continues university scholarship today as a campus of the university of ulster partition the early 1920s in ireland were marked by political violence over the issue of irish independence during the irish war of independence derry was rocked by sectarian violence partly prompted by the guerrilla war raging between the irish republican army and the state forces but also influenced by economic and social pressures in july 1920 several thousand unionist ex british army servicemen mobilised to try to drive catholics out of jobs they had taken during the first world war severe rioting ensued and the loyalists launched an assault on st columb s cathedral which was resisted by armed ira members many lives were lost and in addition many catholics and protestants were expelled from their homes during the communal unrest after a week s violence a truce was negotiated by local politicians on either side in 1921 following the anglo irish treaty and the partition of ireland derry unexpectedly became a border city with much of its natural economic hinterland in county donegal cut off amelia earhart gave the city a much needed boost when she landed here in 1932 becoming the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic her connection with the city is reflected in a display at the amelia earhart cottage at ballyarnett during the second world war the city played an important part in the battle of the atlantic with a substantial presence from the british royal navy and a large number of gis disembarked here the troubles derry perceived itself as suffering under unionist government in northern ireland both politically and economically in the late 1960s the city became the flashpoint of disputes about institutional discrimination and gerrymandering despite having a nationalist majority the city was permanently controlled by unionists due to the partisan drawing of electoral boundaries in addition the city had very high unemployment levels and very poor housing overcrowding in nationalist areas was widely blamed on the political agenda of the unionist government who wanted to confine catholics to a small number of electoral wards yet another contentious issue was the reluctance of the authorities to grant derry the new university of ulster which was instead granted to the predominantly unionist town of coleraine civil rights demonstrations were declared illegal and then violently suppressed by the royal ulster constabulary and ulster special constabulary and catholics were regularly attacked after loyalist parades the events that followed the august 1969 apprentice boys parade resulted in the battle of the bogside when catholic rioters fought the police leading to widespread civil disorder in northern ireland and is often dated as the starting point of the troubles the city is often regarded as the cockpit of the troubles on sunday january 30 1972 13 unarmed civilians were shot dead by british paratroopers during a civil rights march in the bogside area another 13 were wounded and one further man later died of his wounds this event came to be known as bloody sunday because of these events certain areas of derry produced strong support for republican paramilitaries up to 1972 both the provisional ira and official ira operated in the city however in 1972 the oira called a ceasefire following their unpopular killing a local 18 year old who was on leave from the british army the pira however continued attacking security targets and bombing derry s commercial centre in the words of eamonn mccann in his book war and an irish town the city centre looked as if it had been bombed from the air prominent among local provisional ira members was martin mcguinness after 1974 the smaller group the inla also developed a presence in the city the violence in derry eased towards the end of the troubles in the late 1980s and early 1990s irish journalist ed maloney claims in the secret history of the ira that republican leaders there negotiated a de facto ceasefire in the city as early as 1991 whether this is true or not the city did see less bloodshed by this time than belfast or other localities derry has become known worldwide on account of the troubles less well known is its reputation voted by the civic trust in london as one of the ten best cities of its kind to live in in the united kingdom culture in recent years the city and surrounding countryside has become well known for its artistic legacy producing such talents as the nobel prizewinning poet seamus heaney the poet seamus deane the playwright brian friel the

of each variant and or design stage of the boeing b 17 flying fortress heavy bomber for a broader article on the history of the b 17 see b 17 flying fortress boeing model 299 the boeing 299 was the original bomber design made by boeing to fulfill a request by the united states army air corps for a bomber capable of carrying 2 000 lb of bombs 2 000 miles at 200 mph in 1935 the boeing 299 competed with several entries by other companies at an evaluation at wright field on its flight from seattle to wright field for the competition the 299 set a nonstop speed record of 252 mph though it crashed during the demonstration the crash was due to pilot error not any flaw in the airplane despite the crash and more importantly its much higher cost per unit air corps leaders were impressed by the 299 boeing was awarded with a development contract references archived newspaper article usaf museum encyclopedia of american aircraft model 299 crash usaf museum specifications usaf museum y1b 17 yb 17 though still enthusiastic about the design the army air corps decided to cut the order for service test yb 17s from 65 to 13 after the original 299 crashed on 1936 november 20 they changed the source of funding from normal funding to f 1 procurement and redesignated the plan y1b 17 before it even flew unlike its predecessor which had used pratt whitney wasp radials the y1b 17 used the wright cyclone that would become standard on the b 17 several changes were made in the armament and the crew was reduced from seven to six most changes were minor the most notable was switching from double arm to single arm landing gear on 1936 december 7 five days after the first flight of the y1b 17 the brakes of the aircraft fused during landing and it nosed over though damage was minimal the cumulative impact of this event and the crash of the 299 triggered a congressional investigation after the crash the army air corps was on its toes another crash would mean the end of the programme though they were meant for testing the commander of army general head quarters air force major general frank andrews decided to assign twelve y1b 17s to the second bomb group at langley field virginia andrews reasoned that it was best to develop heavy bombing techniques as quickly as possible of the thirteen only one was used for flight testing in 1937 the twelve y1b 17s with the 2nd bombardment group at langley field represented the entire american fleet of heavy bombers most of the time they spent with the planes entailed eliminating problems with the aircraft the most important development they made was the use of a checklist to be reviewed by the pilot and copilot before takeoff it was hoped that this system would prevent accidents similar to that that led to the loss of the 299 in 1938 may the y1b 17s now redesignated b 17 of the 2nd bombardment group took part in a demonstration in which they intercepted the italian liner rex coming into contact with the liner while it was still 700 miles out at sea the demonstration was meant to prove the range and navigational superiority of the b 17 it also showed that the bomber would be an effective tool for attacking an invasion force before reaching the united states the navy was furious about army intrusion into their mission and forced the war department to issue an order restricting the army air force from operations more than a hundred miles from the american coast after three years of flight no serious incidents occurred with the b 17s in 1940 october they were transferred to the 19th bombardment group at march field

test bed however when one of the y1b 17s survived an inadvertent violent spin during a flight in a thunderhead air corps leaders decided that the plane was exceptionally robust and that there would be no need for static testing instead it was used as a testbed for engine types after studying a variety of configurations use of a bottom mounted turbo supercharger was settled on this turbo supercharge became standard on the first production model and allowed it to fly higher and faster than the y1b 17 when testing was complete the y1b 17a was renamed the b 17a references encyclopedia of american aircraft usaf museum b 17b the b 17b 299m was the first production model of the b 17 and was essentially a b 17a with a larger rudder larger flaps and a redesigned nose and 1200 hp r 1820 51 engines the gun turret in the upper nose was replaced with a flexible 30 calibre machine gun at its extreme tip and the bomb aiming window was replaced with an optical flat in the lower part of the nose fairing in the interior of the plane crew members were rearranged many internal systems were revised most notable of these was a switch from pneumatic to hydraulic brakes in october 1942 all planes of the b 17b designation were redesignated rb 17b r indicating restricted the rb 17b was used for training transport messenger and liaison duties it was in effect a designation of obsolescence the b series made it s maiden flight on june 27 1939 39 were built in a single production run but army air corps serial numbers were scattered over several batches this was because of limited funding the army air corps could only buy a few b 17bs at a time references encyclopedia of american aircraft usaf museum b 17c the b 17c was a b 17b with a number of improvements including more powerful r 1820 65 engines to boost crew safety the waist mounted gun blisters were replaced with teardrop shaped sliding panels flush with the fuselage and the ventral gun blister by a metal housing dubbed a bathtub turret some of the most important additions were self sealing fuel tanks and defensive armor with the passage of the lend lease act in 1941 the royal air force began clamoring for use of the b 17 at that time the army air corps was suffering from shortages of the b 17 but hesitantly agreed to provide twenty planes to the raf though the army air corps did not consider the b 17c ready for combat it was desperately needed in britain the twenty planes were placed immediately into frontline service as the fortress mk i in britain the plane performed unremarkably by 1941 september 22 attacks had been flown using a total of 39 planes eight of the twenty were destroyed by the end of the war largely because their guns tended to freeze at high altitude and were generally unable to effectively protect the fortresses their success as a bomber was also limited largely because they were unable to hit anything from the altitudes at which they flew the first c series flew in july 1940 38 were built the eighteen remaining after twenty were transferred to the raf were modified to the configuration used in the b 17d however one of these b 17c 40 2047 crashed while being ferried from salt lake city ut to mcclellan field ca on november 2 1941 references encyclopedia of american aircraft b 17c encyclopedia of american aircraft fortress i usaf museum b 17d though changes in the design made the army air corps decide that the b 17d was worthy of a new subdesignation the b 17c and b 17d were very similar in fact both were given the same subdesignation 299h by boeing several minor changes were made both internally and externally outside the engines received a set of cowling flaps for better cooling and the external bomb racks were removed on the inside the electrical system was revised and another crew member added in the dorsal turret and bathtub turret the guns were doubled bringing the total armament to one 0 30 inch and six 0 50 inch machine guns the b 17d also featured more extensive armor protection a total of 42 were built and the 18 remaining b 17cs were also converted to b 17d format the sole surviving example of this model of the flying fortress exists at the national air and space museum in washington d c and is known as the swoose former crew member frank kurtz named his daughter swoosie kurtz after this aircraft references encyclopedia of american aircraft usaf museum on the b 17d the swoose b 17e the b 17e 299 o was an extensive redesign of that used in previous models up to the b 17d the most obvious change was that in the vertical stabiliser resulting in a shape that was distinctive for the time compare these images of the b 17d and b 17e because experience had shown that the plane would be vulnerable to attack from behind a tail gunner and powered two gun turret behind the cockpit were added to the b 17e design before this crews had to devise elaborate maneuvers to deal with a direct attack from behind including jerking the aircraft laterally allowing the waist gunners to alternate shots at it the configuration with 3 window box would also appear on the b 29 and also adopted by soviet bombers as late as the tupolev tu 16 badger and in different form on the b 52 the teardrop shaped sliding panels of the waist gunners were replaced by larger rectangular windows for better visibility extensive redesign of b 17 tail improved tail gunner added as per combat necessity sliding panels used by waist gunners changed to a rectangular shape in the initial fifth of the production run the ventral bathtub turret was replaced by a remote sighted bendix turret aircraft built after that used a sperry ball turret a total of 512 were built making the b 17e the first mass produced version of the b 17 one of these was later converted to the xb 38 flying fortress since production this size was too large for boeing alone to handle they were assisted by the vega division of lockheed and douglas boeing also built a new plant and douglas added one specifically for production of the b 17 in the middle of 1942 45 b 17es were transferred to the raf where they served under the designation fortress iia likely because of the shortcomings of the fortress i b 17c the raf decided not to use the fortress iia as a daylight high altitude bomber the role for which it had been designed rather they were transferred to the coastal command for anti submarine patrol references encyclopedia of american aircraft b 17e encyclopedia of american aircraft fortress iia usaf museum b 17f the b 17f was an upgrade of the b 17e although outwardly the types were distinguished only by exchanging the framed nose glass for a molded one piece plexiglas cone late production f series recieved a cheek mounted gun either side of the nose and fully feathering paddle bladed propellers numerous internal changes were made to improve the effectiveness range and load capacity of the b 17 however once placed in combat service it was found to be tail heavy the weight of gunners and ammunition when combat loaded moved the center of gravity rearward from its design point and forced the constant use of elevator trim tab stressing this component in combat the b 17f proved almost immediately to have inadequate defensive protection when attacked from the front various armament configurations were tested in the field but the problem was not adequately addressed until the production of the b 17g by using a stronger undercarriage the maximum bomb capacity was increased from 4 200 lb to 8 000 lb though this modification reduced cruise speed by 70 mph 100 km h the increase in bomb capacity was a decided advantage a number of other modifications were made including re integrating external bomb racks but because of its negative impact on both rate of climb and high altitude flight the configuration was rarely used and the racks were removed range and combat radius were extended with the installation in mid production of additional fuel cells in the wings called tokyo tanks nine self sealing rubber composition tanks were mounted inside each wing on either side of the joint between the inner and outer wing sections totaling 1 080 additional gallons to the 1 700 available on the first b 17fs the tokyo tanks added approximately 900 miles to the bomber s range 3405 were built 2300 by boeing 605 by douglas and 500 by lockheed vega

xb 38 the xb 38 was a modification project undertaken primarily by the vega division of lockheed on the ninth b 17e built its primary purpose was testing the feasibility of liquid cooled allison v 1710 89 engines it was meant as an improved version of the b 17 and a variant that could be used if the wright r 1820 engine became scarce completing the modifications took less than a year and the xb 38 made its first flight on 1943 may 19 while it showed a slightly higher top speed after a few flights it had to be grounded due to a problem with engine manifold joints leaking exhaust following the fixing of this problem testing continued until the ninth flight on 1943 june 16 during this flight the third right inboard engine caught fire and the crew was forced to bail out the xb 38 was destroyed and the project cancelled the gains in modification were minimal and would have been disruptive to production of existing models references encyclopedia of american aircraft usaf museum yb 40 prior to the introduction of the p 51 mustang a b 17 escort variant called the yb 40 was introduced this aircraft differed from the standard b 17 in that a second dorsal turret was installed

equipment was replaced with two 0 50 calibre 12 7 mm machine guns in a chin turret to augment the existing cheek machine guns and the bomb bay itself was converted to a magazine the yb 40 would provide a heavily gunned escort capable of accompanying the bombers all the way to the target and back the aircraft was deemed a failure because it could not keep up with standard b 17fs once they had

 id=817106 title thums up nonfiltered 546 processed 538 dbindex 1560551 thums up is a carbonated soft drink cola that is very popular in india where its bold thumbs up logo is common it is similar in flavor to other colas but has a unique taste reminiscent of betel nut introduced in 1977 to offset the expulsion of the coca cola company and other foreign companies from india thums up limca and campa cola gained nationwide acceptance the brand was bought out by coca cola who later re launched it to fight against pepsi after unsuccessful attempts at brand killing background during late 1970s the american cola giant coca cola was shown the door by the indian government following this the parle brothers ramesh chauvan and rajesh chauvan floated parle soft drinks with thums up as their flagship drink along with limca lime flavour and gold spot orange flavored thums up was basically a cola drink but the company never claimed as such and it tasted a bit stronger than regular coke during the same time the owners of coca cola s bottling plant pure drinks ltd launched campa cola and campa orange both of which had a higher dose of carbon dioxide the thums up logo was a clipart of a red thumbs up sign with a slanted white serif typeface this would later be modified by coca cola with blue strokes and a more modern looking typeface this was mainly done to reduce the dominant red color in their signage its famous caption until the early 80s was happy days are here again coined by then famous copywriter vasant kumar whose father was none other than spiritual philosopher u g krishnamurti later it was changed to taste the thunder interestingly there is talk that the thums up logo was devised from a hill near manmad railway station in maharastra the peak looked like a thumbs up sign and in same angle and shape that were in thumsup bottle logo so parle brothers decided to use it as their logo for their flag ship brand market thums up enjoyed a near monopoly with a much stronger market share often overshadowing it other rivals like campa cola double seven and dukes but there were many small regional players had their own market it even withstood liquor giant united breweries group makers of kingfisher beer mcdowell s crush which was another cola drink and one more double cola it was one of the major advertisers throughout the 80 s in mid 80 s it had a brief threat from a newcomer double cola which suddenly disappeared within a few years in 1990 when indian government opened the market to multinationals pepsi was the first to come in thums up went up against the international giant for an intense onslaught with neither side giving any quarter with pepsi roping in major indian movie stars like juhi chawla to thwart the indian brand thums up increased its spending in the cricket sponsorship then the capacity went from 250ml to 300ml aptly names mahacola this nickname gained popularity in smaller towns where people would ask for maha cola instead of thums up the consumers were divided where some felt the pepsi s mild taste was rather bland in 1993 coca cola re entered india after prolonged absences from 1977 to 1993 but coca cola s entry made things even more complicated and the fight became a three way battle that same year in a move that baffled many parle sold out to coke for a meagre us 60 million considering the market share it had some assumed parle had lost the appetite for a fight against the two largest cola brands others surmised that the international brands seemingly endless cash reserves psyched out parle either way it was now coca cola s and coke has a habit of killing brands in its portfolio that might overshadow it coca cola soon introduced its cola in tins which was all india rage with thums up introduced along side albeit minuscule numbers later coca cola started pulling out the thums up brand which at that time still had more than 30 market share re launch still despite its strong overall equity the brand was losing its popularity among the core cola drinking age group of 12 to 25 year olds the cartoon network generation partly due to nil advertising and coca cola s initial brand killing efforts coca cola apparently did try to kill thums up but soon realized that pepsi would benefit more than coke if thums up was withdrawn from the market instead coke decided to use thums up to attack pepsi the coca cola company by this time had about 60 5 share of the indian soft drink market but much to its dismay found out that if it takes out thums up it would remain with only 28 72 of the market according to a report by ngo finance trade in india hence again dusted out the thums up brand and re launched targeting the 30 to 45 year olds probably its old fans who were peeved by both pepsi and coke the brand was re positioned as a manly drink drawing on its strong taste qualities known to be a strong drink with more power packed into it than other colas it was a favourite in rum based cocktails and the byword rum and thums up hence thums up kick started an aggressive campaign directly attacking pepsi s television advertisement focussing on the strength of the drink hoping that the depiction of adult drink would appeal to young consumers grow up to thums up was a successful campaign the brand s market share and equity soared northwards the brand was unshakeable and coca cola s declaration that thums up was india s premier cola brand in terms of market share did not surprise many other campaigns from thums up s build on the strength of its cola and build associations as a macho drink ads showing the thums up man riding through the desert in search of a cantina that sells thums up rather than drink another cola stick in the minds of many indians and caught the imagination of youngsters who want to be seen as men from a brand that was virtually unchallenged to a brand that was stifled thums up stormed back after a near death experience the brand proves that its strength lies not just in its taste but also in its performance the grown up tag is an enduring one and will probably counter pepsi for a while to come thums up is now available in all states except tamil nadu where it was very popular and the state was numero uno in thums up consumption but unfortunately the brand is killed completely in the state by the cola gaint and tamil nadu is the first state where gold spot was also killed along with other local indian brands by cola giants battle with pepsi thums up had the equity to take on pepsi and soon an all out war was on in 2001 thums up took the battle to pepsi by openly challenging it to a blind taste test the aggressive move was intimidating and unexpected turning the tables on pepsi which was now at the receiving end of a taste challenge the results from the challenge were in dispute from both ends but the battle of the mind was won by thums up whose advertising overshadowed the question of accuracy sponsorship and souvenirs thums up was one of the major sponsors in the cricket matches in early 80 s it came out with several postcards featuring sunil gavaskar and imran khan parle s southern bottler was a major sponsor in the indian motorsport scene in 80 s to several indian track drivers in sholavaram races and also to several regional car and bike rallies today old thums up souvenirs and stickers have become

underground it was released by japanese record company captain trip records in august of 2001 about the album after lou reed had quit the velvet underground in august 1970 the band carried on nonetheless doug yule assumed leadership of the band and moved to lead vocals and guitar walter powers joined to play bass guitar this version of the velvet underground which still featured original members sterling morrison and maureen tucker played around 30 dates to promote the band s latest album loaded almost a year after reed morrison also left the band he was replaced by boston keyboard player willie alexander the band then went to tour the united kingdom and the netherlands still in support of loaded which had had a march 1971 release date in europe two dates of this tour november 5 1971 in london and november 19 in amsterdam were recorded by members of the audience and appear as discs 1 and 2 of this set respectively the amsterdam concert was also recorded from the soundboard by dutch radio station vpro and subsequently broadcast on fm radio a few tracks from this broadcast were recorded by a fan and appear as tracks 11 14 on disc 4 of this set once the european tour was completed the plan was for the yule alexander powers tucker to record a new studio album band manager steve sesnick sent alexander powers and tucker home however presumably to retain maximum control over the record and yule recorded the album squeeze on his own sesnick then assembled a backing band around yule to once again tour the united kingdom in support of the forthcoming album but deserted the band just before the start of the tour yule and band struggled through the dates then called it quits one date of this tour december 6 1972 at st david s college lampeter was recorded by an audience member and appears as disc 3 of this set in the spring of 1973 yule and some friends toured new england playing covers and velvet underground material on the invitation of a tour manager as he insisted on billing the band as being the velvet underground despite demands from yule not to do so he was fired after three dates and the tour dissolved one date may 27 1973 in boston was recorded by an audience member and appears as disc 4 of this set is it or isn t it the velvet underground many reed partisans decline to consider any post lou reed material to be the velvet underground the band playing on discs 1 and 2 however is a direct continuation albeit with personnel changes of the band that played new york city in 1970 by disc 3 everybody except doug yule had gone and a backing band now accompanied him since the rights to the name the velvet underground still lay with sesnick and yule technically it would still be the velvet underground but by now it bore hardly any resemblance to the 1965 1970 lineups still the playing is excellent and the vu spirit is there most fans consider the band playing on discs 1 and 2 to be a legitimate continuation of the band drawing the line at the point where alexander powers and tucker were sent home presumably to avoid legal issues using the band name on a post lou reed release the box set is officially not credited to the velvet underground but to the nine individuals appearing on it track listing all songs written by lou reed except as noted disc one chapel of love barry greenwich spector i m waiting for the man spare

 id=816023 title community informatics nonfiltered 581 processed 572 dbindex 1560586 community informatics also known as community networking electronic community networking community based technologies or community technology refers to an emerging set of principles and practices concerned with the use of information and communication technology ict for personal social cultural or economic development within communities it can be considered as an emergent sub discipline of informatics information science engaged in different forms of community action human activity with rare exceptions is lived in communities the concept of community and its connections to different of social networks has seen countless analyses and critiques it can be seen in two contexts first the reality of community as a lived and working experience where the lived community and the physical community overlap as for example in rural areas second the reality and significance of neighbourhoods ethnic and cultural associations and professional interests among others remain central preoccupations and frameworks for social meaning and social action as for example in urban areas thus communities as people coming together in pursuit of their common aims or shared practices both physically and electronically enabled proliferate even while their researched reality remains in considerable dispute while there is considerable investment in supporting the electronic development of business communities for example corporate intranets or purpose built exchange communities such as ebay or applications for individual use there is far less understanding of how to develop electronic communities that are adjunct to everyday social life particularly in communities for whom electronic communication is of second order interest to having an adequate income or social survival there is thus growing interest in how different information and communication technologies can enable and empower ordinary social communities in relation to the achievement of their collective goals academic approaches as an academic discipline community informatics ci can be seen as a field of practice in applied information and communications technology the term was brought to prominence by michael gurstein he brought out the first representative collection of academic papers although others such as brian loader and his colleagues at the university of teesside used the term in the mid 1990s ci brings together the practices of community development and organization and insights from fields such as sociology planning computer science critical theory women s studies library and information sciences management information systems and management studies its outcomes community networks and community based ict enabled service applications are of increasing interest to grassroots organizations ngos and civil society governments the private sector and multilateral agencies among others self organized community initiatives of all varieties from different countries are concerned with ways to harness ict for social capital poverty alleviation and for the empowerment of the local in relation to its larger economic political and social environments some claim it is potentially a form of radical practice community informatics may in fact not gel as a single field within the academy akin for example to information systems or management information systems but remain a convenient locale for interdisciplinary activity drawing upon many fields of social practice and endeavour as well as knowledge of community applications of technology however one can begin to see the emergence of a postmodern trans discipline presenting a challenge to existing disciplinary stove pipes from the perspectives of the rapidly evolving fields of technology practice technology change public policy and commercial interest whether or not such a trans discipline can maintain its momentum remains to be seen given the incertitude about the boundaries of such disciplines as community development furthermore there is a continuing disconnect between those coming from an information science perspective for whom social theories including general theories of organisation are unfamiliar or seemingly irrelevant to solving complex technical problems and those whose focus is upon the theoretical and practical issues around working with communities for democratic and social change given that many of those most actively involved in early efforts were academics drawn from a variety of disciplines including anthropology computing science development studies information science management planning sociology and social work among others it was only inevitable that a process of sense making with respect to these efforts would follow on quite quickly from the flurry of tool making efforts these academics and some community activists connected globally through the medium a first formal meeting of researchers with an academic interest in these initiatives was held in conjunction with the 1999 global community networking conference in buenos aires argentina this meeting began the process of linking developed country community based ict initiatives and research with initiatives being undertaken in less developed countries often as part of larger economic and social development programmes funded by agencies such as the un development programme world bank or the international development research centre for the first time the efforts being undertaken in using ict for economic and social development purposes in the developed countries began to find common interests and common cause with parallel efforts in less developed countries and similarly those with academic or research activities in these areas began to see common and overlapping interests for example the issue of sustainability as a technical cultural and economic problem for community informatics has resulted in a special issue of the journal of community informatics as well as the subject of one prato conference and other conferences in south africa community based approaches many practitioners would dispute any necessary connection to university research regarding academic theorising and interventions as constraining or irrelevant to grassroots activity which should be beyond the control of traditional institutions or simply irrelevant to practical local goals some of the commonalities and differences may be in fact be due to national and cultural differences for example the capacity of many north american and particularly us universities to engage in service learning as part of progressive charters in communities large and small is part of a long standing tradition absent elsewhere however the tradition of service learning is almost entirely absent in the uk australia or new zealand and of limited significance in canada where the state has traditionally played a much stronger role in the delivery of community services and information in some countries such as the uk there is a tradition of locally based grassroots community technology for example in manchester or in hebden bridge in italy and the netherlands there also appears to have been a strong connection between the development of local civic networks based around a tradition of civic oppositionism connected into the work of progressive academics in latin america africa and many parts of asia these efforts have been driven by external funding agencies as part of larger programs and initiatives in support of broader economic and social development goals however these efforts have now become significantly indigenized and particularly in latin america and bottom up ict efforts are increasingly playing a leading role in defining the future use of ict within local communities tensions there is a tension between the practice and research ends of the field to some extent this reflects the gap familiar from other disciplines such as community development community organizing and community based research community health and community education also referred to as community learning between a desire for accountable especially quantifiable and outcome focused social development typically practised by government or supported by foundations and the more participatory qualitatively rich process driven priorities of grass roots community activists familiar from theorists such as paulo freire or deweyan pragmatism some of the theoretical and practical tensions are also familiar from such disciplines as program evaluation and social policy and perhaps paradoxically management information systems where there is continual debate over the relative virtue and values of different forms of research and action spread around different understandings of the virtues or otherwise of allegedly scientific or value free activity frequently associated with responsible and deterministic public policy philosophies and contrasted with more interpretive and process driven viewpoints in bottom up or practice driven activity community informatics would in fact probably benefit from closer knowledge of and relationship to theorists practitioners and evaluators of rigorous qualitative research and practice a further concern is the potential for practice to be hijacked by policy or academic agendas rather than being driven by community goals whether in developed country digital divide programs or in projects situated in less developed countries the ethics of technology intervention in idigenous or other communities has not been sufficiently explored even though icts are increasingly looked upon as an important tool for social and economic development in such communities moreover neither explicit theoretical positions nor ideological positioning has yet to emerge many projects appear to have developed with no particular disciplinary affiliation arising more directly from policy or practice imperatives to do something with technology as funding opportunities arise or as those at the grassroots or working with the grassroots identify ict as possible resources to respond to local issues problems or opportunities the papers and documented outcomes as questions or issues for further research or elaboration on the wiki of the october 2006 prato conference demonstrate that many of the social rather than technical issues are key questions of concern to any practitioner in community settings how to bring about change the nature of authentic or manufactured community ethical frameworks or the politics of community research research and practice interests research and practice ranges from concerns with purely virtual communities to situations in which virtual or online communication are used to enhance existing communities in urban rural or remote geographic locations in developed or developing countries to applications of icts for the range of areas of interest for communities including social and economic development environmental management media and content production public management and e governance among others a central concern although one not always realized in practice is with enabling or empowering communities with ict that is ensuring that the technology is available for the community this further implies an approach to development which is rather more bottom up than top down areas of concern range from small scale projects in particular communities or organizations which might involve only a handful of people such as an on online community of disabled people telecentres civic networks and to large national government sponsored networking projects in countries such as australia and canada or local community projects such as working with maori families in new zealand the gates foundation has been active in supporting public libraries in countries such as chile an area of rapidly developing interest is in the use of ict as a means to enhance citizen engagement as an e governance counterpart or counterweight to transaction oriented initiatives socio technical concerns there is also an emerging interest in the area among those with an interest in the technological aspects of community based ict use and applications in part this is generated by a recognition that new approaches to hardware and software design may be needed to respond to the needs in developing countries or low income communities many of whom may approach computing from a family group or community perspective others approach these issues based on a concern for the social applications and uses of ict while still others have an interest in pursuing these from the perspective of community based ict strategies for knowledge creation management and innovation collaborative decision making and action and flexible dispersed and or community based networking strategies for ict enabled production and control this range of concerns can be seen for example in the november 2006 workshop in montpelier which brought together information systems and sociological perspectives in a rigorous way through both peer reviewed publications and intensive discussions networks there are emerging online and personal networks of researchers and practitioners in community informatics and community networking in many countries as well as international groupings the past decade has also seen conferences in many countries and there is an emerging literature for theoreticians and practitioners including the on line journal of community informatics it is surprising in fact how much in common is found when people from developed and non developed countries meet a common theme is the struggle to convince policy makers of the legitimacy of this approach to developing electronically literate societies instead of a top down or trickle down approach or an approach dominated by technical rather than social solutions which in the end tend to help vendors rather than communities a common criticism that is frequently raised amongst participants at events such as the prato conferences is that a focus on technical solutions evades the social changes that communities need to achieve in their values activities and other people oriented outcomes in order to make better use of technology the field tends to have a progressive bent being concerned about the use of technology for social and cultural development connected to a desire for capacity building or expanding social capital and in a number of countries governments and foundations have funded a variety of community informatics projects and initiatives particularly from a more tightly controlled though not well articulated social planning perspective though knowledge about long term effects of such forms of social intervention on use of technology is still in its early stages associations and publications national associations and organisations have coalesced around these issues in the uk us canada australia the commonwealth of independent states and elsewhere most recently a community informatics research hub has been

 id=306085 title racing game nonfiltered 635 processed 624 dbindex 1560642 a racing game is any game that involves competing in races through a surrogate playing piece or vehicle either getting it from one point to another or completing a number of circuits in the shortest time many board games can be said to be racing games such as snakes and ladders cribbage or formula dé there are also toys made for racing like slot cars and radio controlled cars one of the more common uses of the term racing game is to describe a genre of computer and video games racing games are either in the first or third person perspective they may be based on anything from real world racing leagues to entirely fantastical settings and feature any type of land air or sea vehicles in general they can be distributed along a spectrum anywhere between hardcore simulations and simpler arcade racing games history the arcade title night driver released by atari in 1976 was generally considered as the progenitor of the genre night driver s premise was very simple drive a car down a road without crashing for as long and as fast as possible while it is definitely challenging it is not competition racing true racing as we know it was started by another atari game pole position in 1982 this time the player has ai cars to race against and time limit to keep pushing the players to go faster pole position is also the first game to be based on a real racing circuit racing games in general tend to drift toward the arcade side of reality mainly due to hardware limitations especially in the 1980s and 1990s it is however untrue to say that there were no games considered simulations in their time in 1984 geoff crammond later to develop the grandprix series known collectively as gpx to its fanbase produced what is considered the first attempt at a racing simulator revs for the bbc microcomputer the game offered an unofficial and hence with no official team or driver names associated with the series recreation of british formula 3 the hardware capabilities limited the depth of the simulation and restricted it initially to one track but it was far above any other games at the time in terms of detail in 1986 sega produced out run one of the most graphically impressive game of its time it used two motorola 68000 cpus for its 2d sprite based driving engine and it became an instant classic that spawned many sequels in 1987 midway produced final lap the first arcade game that allowed multiple machines to be linked so you can have multiplayer races in the same year atari produced road blasters a driving game that also involved a bit of shooting in 1989 atari introduced hard drivin the first arcade driving game that included force feedback as well as 3d polygonal graphics this is the first game where the wheel actually fights you as you take harder faster turns it also featured a crash replay camera view that plays back your biggest crashes in 1990 the now defunct papyrus design group produced their first attempt at a racing simulator the critically acclaimed indianapolis 500 the simulation accurately replicating the 1989 indianapolis 500 grid it offered advanced for its time 3d graphics setup options car failures and handling it was later almost forgotten with the success of crammond s f1gp but to this day many argue that it boasted superior graphics to the 1992 title in 1992 sim racing gained a new champion in the shape of world circuit developed by geoff crammond s group simergy it boasted unparalleled detail and a full recreation of the cars and circuits of the 1991 formula one world championship though as with revs it was not granted an official license by the series thus teams and drivers were renamed though could all be changed back to their real names using the driver team selection menu with ayrton senna becoming carlos sanchez and so forth on the other end of the spectrum sega produced virtua racing while not the first game with 3d graphics see revs it was able to combine the best features of games at the time along with multiplayer machine linking and clean 3d graphics to produce a game that was above and beyond the arcade market standard of its time also i nintendo broke new ground by introducing the mario kart series on the snes using the familiar characters from the mario franchise the game not only departed from the realism paradigm by using small karts for the players to drive but also featured fantastic environments and allowed the players to pick up power ups to improve performance or hamper other racers this franchise also spawned multiple sequels in 1993 namco struck back with ridge racer and thus began the polygonal war of driving games sega struck back in 1994 with daytona usa while midway introduced crusin usa atari didn t join the 3d craze until 1997 when it introduced san francisco rush from 1997 on the pc world has caught up to the arcade world in terms of graphical quality mainly due to the introduction of first generation 3d accelerators such as 3dfx voodoo indeed pc games are even more inventive than their arcade cousins as they are not required to force the players to feed more and more quarters the cpu now are capable to simulating decent physics car control and graphics colin mcrae rally was introduced in 1998 to the pc world and was a successful semi simulation of the world of rally driving previously only available in sega s less serious sega rally championship motorhead a pc game was later adapted back to arcade the year 1999 marked a change of games into more free form worlds midtown madness and driver for the pc allow the player to explore a simplified version of the city of chicago using a variety of vehicles and any path that they desire in the arcade world sega introduced crazy taxi where you are a taxi driver that needed to get the client to the destination in the shortest amount of time a similar game also from sega is emergency ambulance driver with almost the same game play pick up patient drop off at hospital as fast as possible games are becoming more and more realistic visually some arcade games are now featuring 3 screens to provide a surround view there is a wide gamut of driving games ranging from simple action arcade racers like mario kart double dash for the nintendo gamecube and nick toon racers to ultra realistic simulators like rfactor live for speed and grand prix legends to sci fi racers and everything in between general genres racing simulators simulation style racing games strive to convincingly replicate the handling of an automobile they often license real cars or racing leagues but will use fantasy cars built to resemble real ones if unable to acquire them although these racing simulators are specifically built for people with a high grade of driving skill it is not uncommon to find aids that can be enabled from the game menu the most common aids are traction control tc anti lock brakes steering assistance damage resistance clutch assistance automatic gearbox etc this softens the learning curve for the difficult handling characteristics of most racing cars the formula one world championship has a fan base all over the world and is one of the racing series with the most simulation adaptations some of these racing simulators are customizable as game fans have decoded the tracks cars and executable files large internet communities have grown around the simulators regarded as the most realistic and many websites host internet championships arcade racers arcade style racing games put fun and a fast paced experience above all else as cars usually compete through odd ways they often license real cars and leagues but are equally open to more exotic settings and vehicles races take place on highways windy roads or in cities they can be multiple lap circuits or point to point with one or multiple paths sometimes with checkpoints or other types of competition like demolition derby jumping or testing driving skills popular arcade racers are the daytona usa series the rush series the cruis n series and the classic out run over the last three years there has

 id=32755 title videos of osama bin laden nonfiltered 646 processed 635 dbindex 1560653 there have been several videos released of osama bin laden most of these were released to arab media organisations such as al jazeera there has been debate in some countries about the propaganda value and the possibility of hidden messages in these tapes as a result some countries have not broadcast the tapes in full the authenticity of some of these tapes is disputed osama bin laden has also been interviewed by journalists such as robert fisk and john miller some audio tapes assumed to be from osama bin laden have also appeared on terrorist attacks bin laden has been interviewed by western journalists and has for several years repeatedly broadcast a list of grievances which he cites as the reason for his declaration of war against the u s most of these statements have been confirmed as bin laden s at least one letter written in arabic ostensibly bin laden s will appeared on the internet but has not been authenticated in 1998 osama bin laden had issued a fatwa we with god s help call on every muslim who believes in god and wishes to be rewarded to comply with god s order to kill the americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it we also call on muslim ulema leaders youths and soldiers to launch the raid on satan s u s troops and the devil s supporters allying with them and to displace those who are behind them so that they may learn a lesson the ruling to kill the americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the al aqsa mosque and the holy mosque from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim in an interview with journalist rahimullah yusufzai published in time magazine january 11 1999 osama bin laden is quoted as saying the international islamic front for jihad against the u s and israel has issued a crystal clear fatwa calling on the islamic nation to carry on jihad aimed at liberating holy sites the nation of muhammad has responded to this appeal if the instigation for jihad against the jews and the americans in order to liberate al aksa mosque and the holy ka aba islamic shrines in the middle east is considered a crime then let history be a witness that i am a criminal tape released by the u s government december 13 2001 on december 13 2001 the united states state department released a video tape apparently showing osama bin laden speaking with khaled al harbi and other associates somewhere in afghanistan before the u s invasion had driven the taliban regime from kandahar the state department claimed that the tape is authentic and was captured by u s forces in afghanistan during a raid on a house in jalalabad the tape appears to implicate bin laden in the september 11 2001 attacks and was aired on many television channels all over the world with an accompanying english translation provided by the united states defense department in this translation osama bin laden displays knowledge of the timing of the actual attack a few days in advance the translation attributes the following lines to bin laden we calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy who would be killed based on the position of the tower we calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors i was the most optimistic of them all we had notification since the previous thursday that the event would take place that day we had finished our work that day and had the radio on muhammad atta from the egyptian family meaning the al qaida egyptian group was in charge of the group the brothers who conducted the operation all they knew was that they have a martyrdom operation and we asked each of them to go to america but they didn t know anything about the operation not even one letter but they were trained and we did not reveal the operation to them until they are there and just before they boarded the planes authenticity the authenticity of the tape has been questioned in the muslim world for the unlikeliness of a taped confession and that bin laden is seen wearing a gold ring which he has not been seen wearing in any other pictures the film loose change points out another inconsistency that although the fbi describes bin laden as being left handed he is seen in the video writing with his right hand some have speculated that this is not so odd bin laden is seen writing a note with his right hand in a photo this photo also contains a journalist you will also see bin laden signing a document with his right hand in the video footage of his arrival in sudan the left hand purportedly carries a heavy negative cultural stigma in arab countries and using the left hand in public can constitute a serious insult aside from questions of the december 13 2001 videotape s authenticity the accuracy of the translation itself was also called into question by the german tv magazine monitor host klaus bednarz ard tv on december 20 2002 german transcript summary in english monitor presented very specific criticism of two notarized arab speaking specialists abdel el m husseini and orient expert professor gernot rotter who claimed the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it the monitor segment claimed the following parts of the english translation were incorrect we calculated in advance the number of casualties who would be killed the translation according to prof rotter and mr husseini is however we calculated the number of casualties that means the words in advance didn t appear in the original and have been added in the text translation transcript we had notification since the previous thursday that the event would take place that day the translation according to prof rotter and mr husseini is however we had notification since thursday previous didn t appear on the original tape nor does the subsequent statement that the event would take place that day we asked each of them to go to america the translation according to prof rotter and mr husseini is however in the passive voice something like they were required rest inaudible the english language transcript and annotations linked on cnn s website however were independently prepared by george michael translator diplomatic language services and dr kassem m wahba arabic language program coordinator school of advanced international studies johns hopkins university they collaborated on their translation and compared it with translations done by the u s government for consistency they concluded there were no inconsistencies in the translations after the tape was released united states secretary of state colin powell said how could there be a doubt in anyone s mind any longer about what we have said from the very very beginning that he was the mastermind he is the head of an organization that participates in this kind of evil activity president george w bush said it proved bin laden has no conscience and no soul ali abunimah vice president of the arab american action network said that he tape should dispel any remaining doubt that bin laden is an evil villain and responsible for the sept 11 attacks most serious people didn t need this tape to be convinced the tapes that had already been released bin laden made it clear since he all but took responsibility for the attacks viewers of al jazeera seemed unconvinced at least one saying that bin laden could have just been bragging to impress his host bin laden denial bin laden denied involvement with the 9 11 attacks five days later on the al jazeera satellite channel i stress that i have not carried out this act which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation this denial was broadcasted worldwide but the bush administration urged media in the u s not to show the video as they claimed it might contain signals to other elements of al qaeda on september 28 2001 in the pakistani newspaper daily ummat bin laden again denied any involvement with the attacks and suggested he was being framed i have already said that i am not involved in the 11 september attacks in the united states as a muslim i try my best to avoid telling a lie i had no knowledge of these attacks nor do i consider the killing of innocent women children and other humans as an appreciable act islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women children and other people there exists a government within the government of the united states that secret government must be asked as to who carried out these attacks the united states should trace the perpetrators of these attacks to those persons who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity so that their own nation could survive tapes released by al jazeera many of the osama bin laden tapes have been released directly by mail or messenger to arabic language satellite television networks like al jazeera or al araabiya october 29 2004 on 29 october 2004 arab television network al jazeera broadcast a video tape 18 minutes in length of what appears to be osama bin laden addressing citizens of the united states according to the english translation distributed by the media he seems to suggest that the september 11 2001 attacks were his idea and that he agreed with mohammed atta on how to carry them out the release of the tape was reportedly timed to come just four days before the 2004 u s presidential election january 19 2006 on 19 january 2006 al jazeera broadcast an audiotape of osama bin laden again addressing citizens of the united states the link here requires a login april 23 2006 on 23 april 2006 al jazeera broadcast parts of an audiotape on this tape bin laden accuses the western world of waging a zionist crusade against islam he comments on hamas darfur and the situation in iraq may 23rd 2006 on may 23rd 2006 al jazeera broadcasted a 5 minute audiotape from bin laden on this tape bin laden commented on the trial of zacarias moussaoui the prisoners in guantanamo bay and the imprisoned journalists sami al hajj and tayssir alouni he denied that any of these apart from a few guantanamo bay prisoners were connected with al qaeda june 30 2006 on june 30 2006 an islamist website posted a recording in which bin laden praised abu musab al zarqawi as a lion of holy war the nineteen minute video shows a still picture of bin laden next to video celebrating al zarqawi us officials said the tape was authentic september 7 2006 on september 7th 2006 another tape was released to al jazeera this video was released four days prior to the fifth anniversary of the 9 11 attacks it was also suggested by michael p jackson deputy secretary of homeland security that this video could have possibly been a signal to al qaeda supporters in the united states to initiate a terrorist attack on the fifth anniversary of 9 11 however no such attacks came to pass timeline and contradictions on september 16 2001 osama bin laden issued the following statement via al jazeera in reference to the 9 11 attacks i stress that i have not carried out this act which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation on december 9 2001 u s military forces in jalalabad found a video tape of bin laden on december 27 2001 a second bin laden video was broadcast on al jazeera the tape was reportedly made after november 16 2001 there were notable differences in the appearance of bin laden in the two tapes although it is notable that they were shot under very different lighting conditions and that the quality of the jalalabad tape is not very good making direct comparisons somewhat less than reliable some accounts claimed bin laden was suffering from hepatitis c and peter bergen said this is a man who was clearly not well i mean as you see from these pictures here he s really by december he s looking pretty terrible he s barely moving the left side of his body so he s clearly got diabetes he has low blood pressure he s got a wound in his foot he s apparently got dialysis for kidney problems he could already be dead but we need to keep searching for him the recording was dismissed by the bush administration as propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al qaeda leader was already dead he could have made the video and then ordered that it be released in the event of his death said one white house aide other prominent figures expressed confusion on bin laden s status in january 2002 pakistan s president pervez musharraf stated i would give the first priority that he is dead and the second priority that he is alive somewhere in afghanistan in october 2002 afghanistan s president hamid karzai said i would come to believe that laden probably is dead but still you never know he might be alive five months ago six months ago i was thinking that he was alive the more we don t hear of him and the more time passes there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere in july 2002 us federal bureau of investigation s counter terrorism chief dale watson stated is bin laden alive or is he dead i am not really sure of the answer i personally think he is probably not with us anymore but i have no evidence to support that on december 26 2001 foxnews reported usama bin laden has died a peaceful death due to an untreated lung complication the pakistan observer reported citing a taliban leader who allegedly attended the funeral of the al qaeda leader the world tribune subsequently reported israel and the united states assess that bin laden probably died in the u s military campaign in afghanistan in december they said the emergence of new messages by bin laden are probably fabrications on september 9 2002 an audio tape made by bin laden was broadcast on al jazeera us intelligence officials concluded the tape was genuine as did french researcher bernard gautheron director of the phonetic testing laboratory at the institute of linguistics and phonetics in paris researchers at the dalle molle institute for perceptual artificial intelligence in martigny switzerland claimed they were 95 sure the recording was a fake but they since have refused to evaluate subsequent tapes on february 12 2003 u s secretary of state colin powell told a senate panel that he had reviewed a transcript of a message from bin laden stating he was partnership with iraq which was to be broadcast on al jazeera al jazeera initially denied having the tape but subsequently located it on october 29 2004 two days before the us elections the arab television network al jazeera broadcast a videotape apparently showing bin laden addressing the people of the united states in this video he appears to take credit for the idea to attack the wtc towers he also condemns the bush government s response to the attacks and presents the attacks as part of a campaign of revenge and deterrence begun after personally seeing the destruction of the lebanese civil war in 1982 see 2004 osama bin laden video walter cronkite said of the video i m a little inclined to think that karl rove the political manager at the white house who is a very clever man he probably set up bin laden to this thing president bush opened up a six point lead over john kerry in the first opinion poll to include sampling taken after the videotape was broadcast on 23 may 2006 another audiotape purportedly of bin laden surfaced on the internet on the tape bin laden claims that it was he alone who assigned the hijackers to perform the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states and that zacarias moussaoui had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks he had no connection at all with sept 11 i am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and i never assigned brother zacarias to be with them in that mission i am certain of what i say because i was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers with the raids said bin laden who was speaking about the 9 11 hijackers he also claimed that all of the detainees held at guantanamo bay had nothing to do with the september 11th attacks videos of osama bin laden in popular culture the australian comedy group the chaser features a recurring segment

more than 200 projects in california japan and mexico and around the world reasoning that users know more about the buildings they need than any architect could he produced and validated in collaboration with sarah ishikawa and murray silverstein a pattern language designed to empower any human being to design and build at any scale alexander was a licensed contractor and architect in england in 1958 he moved to the united states and has lived in berkeley california from 1963 until the present he is professor emeritus at the university of california berkeley education alexander grew up in england and his education started in sciences he was awarded the top open scholarship to trinity college cambridge university in 1954 in chemistry and physics and went on to read mathematics he earned a bachelor s degree in architecture and a master s degree in mathematics he took his doctorate at harvard the first ph d in architecture ever awarded at harvard university and was elected fellow at harvard during the same period he worked at mit in transportation theory and in computer science and worked at harvard in cognition and cognitive studies he became professor of architecture at berkeley in 1963 taught there continuously for 38 years and is now professor emeritus at the university of california he is widely recognized as the father of the pattern language movement in computer science he was elected fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1996 for his contributions to architecture career writings the timeless way of building described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire there is one timeless way of building it is a thousand years old and the same today as it has ever been the great traditional buildings of the past the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way it is not possible to make great buildings or great towns beautiful places places where you feel yourself places where you feel alive except by following this way and as you will see this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills and as our faces are a pattern language towns buildings construction described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a generative grammar the work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious the authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations the book provides rules and pictures and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project it describes exact methods for constructing practical safe and attractive designs at every scale from entire regions through cities neighborhoods gardens buildings rooms built in furniture and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs a notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality the book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel uses easily stored inexpensive materials and produces long lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials design and labor it first has users prototype a structure on site in temporary materials once accepted these are finished by filling them with very low density concrete it uses vaulted construction to build as high as three stories permitting very high densities this book s method was adopted by the university of oregon as described in the oregon experiment and remains the official planning instrument it has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code the idea of a pattern language appears to apply to any complex engineering task and has been applied to some of them it has been especially influential in software engineering where patterns have been used to document collective knowledge in the field the nature of order an essay on the art of building and the nature of the universe which includes the phenomenon of life the process of creating life a vision of a living world and the luminous ground is alexander s latest and most comprehensive and elaborate work in it he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture building planning and the way in which we view the world in general the mostly static patterns from a pattern language have been amended by more dynamic sequences which describe how to work towards patterns which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences sequences like patterns promise to be tools of wider scope than building just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture architecture among alexander s most notable built works are the eishin campus near tokyo the west dean visitors centre in sussex england the julian street inn a homeless shelter in san jose california both described in nature of order the martinez house an experimental house in martinez california made of lightweight concrete and the low cost housing in mexicali mexico described in the production of houses influence computer science alexander s notes on the synthesis of form was required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s marvin minsky founder of mit s artificial intelligence lab recommended it to students and colleagues it had an influence in the 1960s and 1970s on programming language design modular programming object oriented programming software engineering and other design methodologies alexander s mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to edsger dijkstra s influential a discipline of programming a pattern language s greatest influence in computer science is the design patterns movement alexander s philosophy of incremental organic coherent design influenced also the

impartial legislation law enforcement and judicial and administrative process it also requires that economic and social opportunities be made available to each person without any discrimination exclusion and marginalization can lead to frustration hostility and fanaticism 2 2 in order to achieve a more tolerant society states should ratify existing international human rights conventions and draft new legislation where necessary to ensure equality of treatment and of opportunity for all groups and individuals in society 2 3 it is essential for international harmony that individuals communities and nations accept and respect the multicultural character of the human family without tolerance there can be no peace and without peace there can be no development or democracy 2 4

the declaration on race and racial prejudice all individuals and groups have the right to be different article 1 2 article 3 social dimensions 3 1 in the modern world tolerance is more essential than ever before it is an age marked by the globalization of the economy and by rapidly increasing mobility communication integration and interdependence large scale migrations and displacement of populations urbanization and changing social patterns since every part of the world is characterized by diversity escalating intolerance and strife potentially menaces every region it is not confined to any country but is a global threat 3 2 tolerance is necessary between individuals and at the family and community levels tolerance promotion and the shaping of attitudes of openness mutual listening and solidarity should take place in schools and universities and through non formal education at home and in the workplace the communication media are in a position to play a constructive role in facilitating free and open dialogue and discussion disseminating the values of tolerance and highlighting the dangers of indifference towards the rise in intolerant groups and ideologies 3 3 as affirmed by the unesco declaration on race and racial prejudice measures must be taken to ensure equality in dignity and rights for individuals and groups wherever necessary in this respect particular attention should be paid to vulnerable groups which are socially or economically disadvantaged so as to afford them the protection of the laws and social measures in force in particular with regard to housing employment and health to respect the authenticity of their culture and values and to facilitate their social and occupational advancement and integration especially through education 3 4 appropriate scientific studies and networking should be undertaken to co ordinate the international community s response to this global challenge including analysis by the social sciences of root causes and effective countermeasures as well as research and monitoring in support of policy making and standard setting action by member states article 4 education 4 1 education is the most effective means of preventing intolerance the first step in tolerance education is to teach people what their shared rights and freedoms are so that they may be respected and to promote the will to protect those of others 4 2 education for tolerance should be considered an urgent imperative that is why it is necessary to promote systematic and rational tolerance teaching methods that will address the cultural social economic political and religious sources of intolerance major roots of violence and exclusion education policies and programmes should contribute to development of understanding solidarity and tolerance among individuals as well as among ethnic social cultural religious and linguistic groups and nations 4 3 education for tolerance should aim at countering

languages the letter is represented by e with caron taken from czech alphabet in very old cyrillic tombstones exists a special form of the letter called an iotated yat the yat represented a common slavic long vowel it is generally believed to have represented the sound which was a reflex of earlier or that the sound represented by yat developed late in the history of common slavonic is indicated by its role in the second palatalization of the slavonic velars it is significant that from the earliest texts there is considerable confusion between the yat and the cyrillic iotified a one explanation is that the dialect of thessaloniki on which the old church slavonic literary language was based and other south slavonic dialects shifted from independent from the northern and western branches the confusion was also possibly aggravated by the fact that cyrillic little yus looks very similar to the older glagolitic alphabet s yat supported only in unicode 4 1 here s an image in various modern slavic languages the yat has reflexed into various vowels for example the old slavic root b l white became bel in standard russian dialectal or even in some regions bil in ukrainian bjal in bulgarian biel bia y in polish and bílý in czech older unrelated reflexes of yat exist for example old word carts became modern russian but in serbian it is as a result of these reflexes yat no longer represented an independent phoneme but rather one identical to that represented by another cyrillic letter as a result children had to memorise by rote where to write yat and where not therefore the letter was dropped in a series of orthographic reforms in serbian with the reform of vuk karad i which was later adopted for macedonian in russian belarusian and ukrainian roughly with the october revolution and in bulgarian as late as 1945 the letter is no longer used in the standard modern orthography of any of the slavic languages written with the cyrillic alphabet although it survives in liturgical and church texts written in the russian recension of church slavonic and has since 1991 found some favour in advertising yat in russia and ukraine in the russian language confusion between the yat and e in writing occurs from the earliest records but when exactly the final disappearance of the original sound from all dialects took place is a topic of scientific debate some scholars for example w k matthews have placed the coalescence of the two sounds at the earliest historical phases eleventh century or earlier attributing its use until 1918 to church slavonic influence within russia itself however a consensus has found its way into university textbooks of historical grammar e g v v ivanov that taking all the dialects into account the sounds remained predominantly distinct until the eighteenth century at least under stress and are distinct to this day in some localities it may be noteworthy in this respect that the yat in ukrainian usually merged in sound with i and therefore has remained distinct from e the story of the letter yat and its elimination from the russian alphabet makes for an interesting footnote in russian cultural history see reforms of russian orthography a full list of words that were written with the letter yat at the beginning of twentieth century can be found in the yat in serbo croatian in the central south slavic group yat has morphed into three distinct forms e i je and i and this has become one of the differentiating criteria between the dialects see rendering of yat for details yat in bulgarian in bulgarian the different reflexes of the yat form the so called yat border yatova granitsa running approximately from nikopol on the danube to solun thessaloniki on the aegean sea the yat border is the most important bulgarian isogloss marking pronunciation of the old yat as either a and soft consonant before it represented by in standard bulgarian or e to the east bjal but plural beli and only as e bel beli to the west continuing in macedonian and serbian dialects the elimination of the yat from the bulgarian alphabet in 1945 was seen by many bulgarian macedonians as a betrayal of the western dialects and an artificial separation of bulgarian from the macedonian dialects after 1989 many right wing political and cultural organisations like the bulgarian national radical party and the internal macedonian revolutionary organisation vmro in bulgaria tried to initiate a debate on orthographic reform and reintroduction of the yat yat in rusyn in the rusyn language yat was used until 1945 and removed during the soviet occupation nowadays some rusyn wrters and poets try to reinstate it but this initiative isn t really popular among rusyn intelligentsia code positions yat is present in unicode though it is often absent from commonly available fonts if your browser handles correctly unicode and has a font which includes the letter you should see the capital and small yats here its html entities are 1122 or x462 for the capital and 1123 or x463 for the small letter see also yus endofarticle doc doc

website of the white house and the presidential administration of the united states of america in reality it is a parody of u s president george w bush and his family friends and administration to avoid confusion between the parody and the bona fide white house website the words a chickenhead production parody and a link to a disclaimer are listed at the bottom of each webpage in spite of the site s authors efforts to make the distinction obvious some of the reader mail posted to the website indicates that some readers nevertheless believe or at least pretend to believe whitehouse org is the real white house website the actual white house site is at whitehouse gov humor and themes the website s purpose is to satirize the administration their supporters and their politics using a writing style called farce the jokes are outrageous and the characterizations of the targeted people are extreme and outlandish one of the common strategies of the site is to publish news satire via fake press releases following a real event concerning the administration or its prominent supporters each fake press release purports to be the transcript of a speech the minutes of a conversation or meeting or an official governmental document each is accompanied by a severely doctored photograph providing a fictional visual scene for the occurrence for example after in reality justice antonin scalia of the u s supreme court came under scrutiny for being a hunting buddy of u s vice pres dick cheney while the court was considering a case of cheney s whitehouse org included a fake dual statement titled joint statement by vice president cheney and justice scalia vigorously defending the propriety of their extracurricular commingling and accompanied with a false image of cheney and scalia together in a hot tub the authors depict the administration and their supporters as greedy arrogant overtly egotistical culturally ignorant nepotist misogynist racist homophobic xenophobic anti semitic anti catholic power hungry warhawks who have absolutely no regard for any privacy or human rights other than their own in keeping with those characterizations women and ethnic and religious minorities who are in or favor the administration are ironically portrayed as unquestioning flock in relatively low level job positions and who the caucasian men of the administration dislike but keep around for support for example u s secy of transit norm mineta is listed as the chauffeur and unfeatured anywhere but the list of members of the administration while justice clarence thomas of the u s supreme court is listed as the best boy and is fictionally quoted responding little if at all to any questions unrelated to pornography u s secy of state condoleezza rice is an exception to the rule but one of the aforementioned posters fictionally quotes her exclaiming i m fighting for whitey also in keeping with the themes a spoof of the u s seal of the president with the bald eagle replaced with a vulture appears on each webpage conflict with the real office of the vice president whitehouse org gained some attention in the media in early 2003 when one page on the website was the center of a dispute between cheney s vice presidential counsel david addington and john a wooden the editor in chief of chickenhead productions addington made what was likely a litigation threat intended to scare the authors into censoring the website addington s effort whatever the intents unexpectedly backfired in 2002 dec addington in reality sent a cease and desist letter to wooden which read as if an attorney had authored it consisting entirely of academic language and containing several researched references to judicial opinions in the letter addington argued that certain characteristics of the fictional profile of lynne cheney dick cheney s wife on whitehouse org were cause for litigation should second lady cheney decide to file a lawsuit against chickenhead productions among the characteristics cited photographs of her were used for a for profit website without her permission she was portrayed in the false biography in a false light and that few people are likely to notice your disclaimer link and even fewer are likely to click on the link and actually see the disclaimer addington also cited the spoof of the presidential seal was displayed on every page of the website asserting such use of the seal was a violation of federal law addington conclusively demanded that wooden delete the photographs and fictional text of the falsely biographical page and to fax him with notifications of the changes but clarified that nothing in this request should be construed as expressing the lawfulness wrongfulness or inappropriateness or not of any other aspect of your website wooden then had censored posted in large red letters with respect to the webpage for each aforementioned photograph placed a fake red nose on lynne cheney and blackened some of her teeth and inserted into the webpage a special disclaimer that read in part mrs cheney s husband wishes you to be aware that some all of the biographic information about mrs cheney may not actually be true the editors of whitehouse org are confident that any rumors about mrs cheney formerly being a crystal meth pusher are 100 likely to be absolutely untrue similarly any stories about her penchant for licking brandy alexanders off the hirsute belly of her spouse are all lies lies lies he then satirized the incident in a fake statement by the vice president on whitehouse org on feb 20th 2003 titled irate vice president cheney issues a punctilious legally precise oh wise guy eh why i oughta letter to nefarious whitehouse org terror portal wooden then gave a copy of the letter to the new york city chapter of the american civil liberties union who then went to the press to speak out in defence of wooden s first amendment rights wooden also spoke briefly of this to an editor for the washington post all those at the vice president s office except addington then tried to distance themselves from addington s letter telling the press that addington acted without dick or lynne cheney s knowledge and no

 id=1810818 title acid attack nonfiltered 721 processed 710 dbindex 1560729 acid attacks are a violent phenomenon that primarily occur in parts of certain south asian countries such as india pakistan and bangladesh and are often perpetrated by males against females perpetrators of these attacks throw acid at their victims burning them the consequences are multiple permanent marks on the body disfiguration and potentially blindness the chemical agent used to commit these attacks is either hydrochloric acid widely available in south asian countries as a toilet cleaner or sulphuric acid from batteries because the chemical causes severe disfigurement not death this easily accessible chemical has become the popular weapon for attacks against women who refuse sexual advances and offers of marriage made by men acid attacks are not often classified as domestic violence because they usually originate outside of the home on the other hand there is a protective attitude that declares this perception of acid attacks as inherently western another example of western ethnocentrism that characterizes other eastern countries as barbaric and or backward supporters of this stance often claim that these practices their prevalence and their significance are taken out of context by the western media and greatly exaggerated as evidence it is alleged that acid attacks are frequently the subject of lifetime original movies and have been referenced by primetime television shows such as family guy and the simpsons however there have been several culturally local voices joining what was once a primarily western discourse on the subject of acid attacks deeming them horrific acts of violence on march 8 2002 many men and women in bangladesh marched against acid attacks victims although acid attacks mainly target women there has been a case in which a man was deliberately attacked by a woman another where a man was attacked by a male and several other situations where men were inadvertently harmed due to their proximity in the first case a man who divorced his wife was targeted by her with acid on two occasions permanently losing sight in one eye in the first assault she was arrested after chasing him in the streets when police discovered that she was carrying acid intending to attack again in the second incident a muslim cleric in karachi sindh pakistan was accused of attacking a male student with acid because the student refused his sexual advances female attacks on males are comparatively rare acid attacks around the world such attacks are not unknown in various parts of the world australia a chinese australian named dominic li was murdered by gangsters by having acid poured down his throat cambodia acid attacks are frequently inflicted upon mistresses canada there was an incident within the country in 2000 china acid attacks have been reported within the country ethiopia a particularly gruesome attack was committed in the context of the eritrean ethiopian war italy michael musmanno discusses attending a trial for a similar crime during the inter war period southern thailand six thai youths were assaulted with acid in pattani allegedly by malay muslim rebels cultural issues critics of these attacks consider them evidence of deep rooted misogyny present in these societies this stance is aggravated by the lenience of punishment for these crimes convictions peaked in 2002 at 87 out of 410 attacks and the attitudes that characterize the perpetrators as victims spurned suitors whose revenge qualifies as poetic justice detractors deem acid attacks another manifestation of social structures that demand women and girls unquestioningly submit to male authority the debate between east and west often obstructs social disease recognition primary examples of this problem frequently concern women acid attacks clitoridectomy honor killings and sati to name a few the debate of east vs west is repeatedly invoked to prevent local agitation for change creating the discourse in us vs them terms this makes it difficult for those located within the society to protest the practice in question characterizing them as anti culture or pro west although it is necessary to proceed with caution when critiquing a practice that is fundamentally foreign to the critic s way of life no amount of cultural difference can disguise a human rights violation related social problems acid attacks are differentiated from dowry harassments where women are harassed for increasing dowries after marriage and punished often with death for failure to obtain the requested amounts of money or goods the method of killing these brides is typically by fire due to the notorious instability of oil cookstoves that are then blamed for the attacks although these deaths are often deemed accidental the incidence of dowry burnings has only recently subsided due in large part to the penal and preventative legislation introduced by the indian union unlike acid attacks these dowry related assaults and murders are orchestrated most often by the mother in law and represent a spin on the traditional view of misogyny as male perpetuated other practices perceived to be misogynistic problems by their critics that occur within parts of south asia are child marriages and sati moreover there is a prevalence of abandoned female children widows aged parents mothers as well as the method of female foeticide that attest to the misogynistic overtones still common within sections of south asian countries see also vitriolage external links

seat in ouachita parish in 1975 the same year that governor edwin washington edwards won the second of his four gubernatorial terms dimos became a reformer in the legislature and was hence tapped by roemer as speaker in 1988 while roemer switched parties in 1991 dimos remained a democrat in louisiana the governor selects the house speaker rather than the members themselves dimos was strongly prolife in his legislative career he opposed roemer s veto of a bill sponsored by representative louis elwood woody jenkins of baton rouge which would have outlawed most abortions in louisiana and presumably resulted in a legal challenge in federal court defending controversial tulane scholarships representative dimos rose to defend an old state law which permits tulane his alma mater to avoid paying taxes to the state the university instead places scholarship waivers into the hands of state legislators and the mayor of new orleans who then select the recipients the purpose of the law was to make a college education available to qualified citizens who could not otherwise engage in formal higher education in recent years lawsuits have divulged that many of the recipients have been the

s house bill 41 a proposed amendment to the louisiana constitution failed 44 57 in the house vitter said that the change is needed to end the controversy that began with revelations that lawmakers had awarded the scholarships to themselves their children and relatives of contributors although reforms were made vitter said the program is open for continued abuse his bill would have phased out the tulane scholarships which were then worth about 20 000 per year by the 1999 2000 academic year so those who are using the grants could finish their academic careers the measure also would have stripped tulane of the property tax breaks the legislature approved in 1884 when the university started making the scholarships available dimos emerged as the house s foremost defender of tulane any abuses were not the fault of tulane he argued but of lawmakers who had undermined the intent of an otherwise worthy program district judge 1999 2006 dimos resigned from the legislature when he was elected to the fourth district bench to succeed republican judge robert w bob kostelka kostelka had stepped down from the judgeship in 1998 when he was elected without opposition to the state second

however been criticized by attorneys who claim that he is too quick to prejudge a case and he often coerces one side into settling by threatening that party with an even bigger judgment if they procede to put on their case the law is a fascinating profession you ve got to enjoy it to be in it and i enjoyed it dimos said when he was asked what he would most miss about serving as a judge dimos told the ouachita citizen newspaper in west monroe that he liked the interaction with attorneys and their clients as well as the camaraderie with other judges he also said that he enjoyed presiding over jury trials however dimos said that he will not miss having to decide which parent gets custody of a child i hate seeing those cases come to court but sometimes it can t be avoided in 2003 dimos underwent treatment for cancer of the throat but he has been declared cancer free he said that his health played no role in his decision to retire i love people i love to help them i love to help them solve their problems if you don t like doing that you don t need to be in public service he added dimos indicated that he may rejoin his former monroe law firm brown erskine and burkett on a reduced

income taxes in their present form was ratified on february 3 1913 the amendment states the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration background the u s constitution provides in part the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises but all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states the constitution also provides in part representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union according to their respective numbers the constitution further provides no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken the power to impose taxes whether deemed direct or indirect taxes is granted by article i section 8 clause 1 indirect taxes or excises in the parlance of the text of the constitution are required to be geographically uniform according to article i section 8 clause 1 and the court decisions interpreting that provision see knowlton v moore and flint v stone tracy co until the ratification of the sixteenth amendment all direct taxes were required to be apportioned among the states according to each state s population per article i section 2 clause 3 and article i section 9 clause 4 this essentially meant that the dollar amount of direct taxes imposed on the taxpayers in any given state was required to bear a relationship to the total dollar amount of direct taxes imposed in the entire nation that was equal to the ratio of that state s population to the total population of the nation treatment of income taxes prior to the pollock case prior to the 1895 u s supreme court decision in the case of pollock v farmers loan trust co all income taxes had been considered to be excises indirect taxes required to be imposed with geographical uniformity but not required to be apportioned among the states according to population the wilson gorman tariff act of 1894 attempted to impose a federal tax of 2 on incomes over 3 000 derided by its opponents as communistic it was challenged in federal court until that time direct taxes had been deemed to include only capitations or poll taxes taxes directly on persons and property taxes imposed on property by reason of its ownership generally ordinary ad valorem property taxes until 1895 all income taxes regardless of the sources of the incomes had been considered indirect taxes excises the pollock case in the case of pollock v farmers loan trust co the supreme court declared that certain income taxes taxes on income from property under the 1894 act to be unconstitutional unapportioned direct taxes the court reasoned that a tax on income from property should be treated as a tax on property by reason of its ownership and should therefore be required to be apportioned the reasoning was that taxes on the rents from land the dividends from stocks and so on burdened the property generating the income in the same way that a tax on property by reason of its ownership burdened that property this meant that after pollock while income taxes on income from labor as indirect taxes were still not required to be apportioned by population taxes on interest dividends and rent income were required to be apportioned by population the pollock ruling made the source of the income e g property versus labor etc relevant in determining whether the tax imposed on that income was deemed to be direct and thus required to be apportioned among the states according to population or alternatively indirect and thus required only to be imposed with geographical uniformity during this period from 1895 to 1913 when the sixteenth amendment was ratified while congress could have re imposed taxes on income from labor and other non property sources without apportionment by population imposing taxes on interest dividends and rent income would not have been practical as the income from property in each state would virtually never correspond to the population of that state in relation to the population of the entire nation the congress was unwilling to impose an income tax on labor and other non property sources without also imposing a tax on income from property and taxes on income from property were no longer realistic the pollock ruling made imposition of an income tax politically unfeasible from 1895 until the ratification of the sixteenth amendment at the same time congress was reflecting the growing concern among many elements of society that the wealthiest americans had consolidated too much economic power ratification process in response to these developments the sixteenth amendment was passed by the sixty first congress and submitted to legislatures of the several states on july 12th 1909 the amendment was the crowning feature of a larger trend of legislative action meant to curb the power of the wealthy the famous pujo committee hearings which aired the incestuous relationship between banks and corporate interests were held during ratification and the clayton antitrust act was enacted shortly thereafter on february 25 1913 the republican secretary of state philander knox proclaimed that the amendment had been ratified by the necessary three quarters of the states ensuring the constitutionality of unapportioned federal income taxes the amendment was ratified by 42 states in all alabama on august 10

action on the amendment interpretation the amendment which overrules the effect of pollock essentially means that when imposing an income tax the congress may impose the tax on income from any source without having to apportion the total dollar amount of tax collected from each state according to each state s population in relation to the total national population the supreme court s interpretation of the sixteenth amendment has evolved and adapted considerably over time many disputes about the applicability of the amendment to specific types of income spring from reliance on the language of out dated interpretations and overturned decisions early decisions in brushaber v union pacific railroad the supreme court indicated that the sixteenth amendment did not give the congress a new power to tax incomes as congress already had that power although an income tax on income from property had been deemed under pollock above to be a direct tax and an income tax on wages etc had been deemed to be an indirect tax an excise the court in brushaber decided that after the sixteenth amendment the constitution allows congress to tax any incomes without apportionment among the states by population and without regard to any census or enumeration regardless of the source of the income that is regardless of whether the particular income tax is deemed direct such as a tax on income from property or indirect i e an excise such as a tax on income from labor the sixteenth amendment made the distinction between a direct tax and an indirect tax constitutionally irrelevant with respect to the apportionment of income taxes by removing the apportionment requirement for income taxes in brushaber the court upheld the validity of the federal income tax statute under the u s constitution as amended by the sixteenth amendment in the supreme court case of bowers v kerbaugh empire co mr justice butler stated it was not the purpose or the effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power congress already had the power to tax all incomes but taxes on incomes from some sources had been held to be direct taxes within the meaning of the constitutional requirement as to apportionment omitted the amendment relieved from that requirement and obliterated the distinction in that respect between taxes on income that are direct taxes and those that are not and so put on the same basis all incomes from whatever source derived omitted income has been taken to mean the same thing as used in the corporation excise tax of 1909 36 stat 112 in the sixteenth amendment and in the various revenue acts subsequently passed omitted after full consideration this court declared that income may be defined as gain derived from capital from labor or from both combined including profit gained through sale or conversion of capital although the sixteenth amendment is often cited as the source of the congressional power to tax incomes at least one court has reiterated the point made in brushaber and other cases that the sixteenth amendment itself did not grant the u s congress the power to tax incomes a power congress has had since the late 1700s but only removed the requirement if any that any income tax be apportioned among the states according to population in dealing with the scope of the taxing power the question has sometimes been framed in terms of whether something can be taxed as income under the sixteenth amendment this is an inaccurate formulation and has led to much loose thinking on the subject the source of the taxing power is not the sixteenth amendment it is article i section 8 of the constitution john r luckey legislative attorney for the american law division of the congressional research service writes on page four of faq concerning the federal income tax that the court found that the sixteenth amendment sought to restrain the court from viewing an income tax because of its close effect on the underlying property as a direct tax modern interpretation in commissioner v glenshaw glass co the supreme court laid out what has become the modern understanding of what constitutes income to which the sixteenth amendment applies declaring that income taxes could be levied on accessions to wealth clearly realized and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion under this definition any increase in wealth whether through wages benefits bonuses sale of stock or other property at a profit bets won lucky finds awards of punitive damages in a lawsuit qui tam actions are all within the definition of income unless congress makes a specific exemption as it has for items such as life insurance proceeds received by reason of the death of the insured party gifts bequests devises and inheritances and certain scholarships recent rulings on december 22 2006 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated its own august 2006 ruling in murphy v internal revenue service and united states in its original august 2006 decision the court had ruled that was unconstitutional under the sixteenth amendment to the extent that the statute purported to tax as income a recovery for a non physical personal injury for mental distress and loss of reputation not received in lieu of taxable income such as lost wages or earnings the murphy ruling had been mandatory precedent only in

article tax protester constitutional arguments covers this topic in considerably more detail including details on the specific arguments made against ratification some tax protesters conspiracy investigators and others opposed to income taxes cite what they contend is evidence that the sixteenth amendment was never properly ratified one such argument is that because the legislatures of various states passed resolutions of ratification with different capitalization spelling of words or punctuation marks e g semi colons instead of commas from the text proposed by congress those states ratifications were invalid a related argument is that various states illegally violated procedural requirements of their constitutions when passing their ratification resolutions another argument made by some tax protesters regards ohio one of the states listed as ratifying the amendment they contend that because congress did not pass an official proclamation recognizing ohio s date of admission 1803 to statehood until 1953 see ohio constitution ohio was not a state until 1953 and therefore could not have ratified the sixteenth amendment these and similar arguments have been universally

jiànhuá shanghainese cantonese jyutping dung2 gin3 waa4 born july 7 1937 in shanghai china was the first elected chief executive of the hong kong special administrative region of the people s republic of china prc before the handover tung was known as a conservative businessman with traditional chinese values and strong connections to the central government he took office on july 1 1997 after the handover of hong kong from the united kingdom to the people s republic of china and was elected again to a second five year term in 2002 he gained the nicknamed old confused tung his first term was hampered by the asian financial crisis and criticism of his style of governance as a result he was frequently subject to attack and ridicule by pro democracy activists and legislators the media and academics foreign news outlets such as time magazine the economist and wired news services portrayed him as being deeply unpopular singularly ineffective and of being a loser eager to please his mainland masters dissatisfaction among the public towards tung grew consistently throughout his tenure and culminated in huge protests in 2003 after the outbreak of sars and the article 23 controversies when sloganeers demanded that tung step down as a result of this increasing criticism within hong kong and almost certainly because he had lost the confidence of the central government tung announced his resignation due to health reasons on march 10 2005 just three years into his second term as chief executive on the following day he became vice chairman of the chinese people s political consultative conference his name is spelt with three different systems his family name tung is spelt with mandarin wade giles although cantonese romanization would give the same spelling this is not the system used the first character of his given name chee is spelt with shanghainese romanization the second character of his given name hwa is spelt with gwoyeu romatzyh early life born in shanghai or zhoushan tung s family moved to hong kong when he was 10 and his father tung chao yung went on to become a successful entrepreneur in the shipping sector after the death of his father tung as the elder son took over his father s business however with the decline of the shipping industry and tung s failure to diversify the business floundered according to some accounts the then prc government through tung s friend henry fok bailed tung out by handing his company contracts for arms shipments these were in addition to a hefty loan from hsbc some have further speculated that tung whose family was once pro kuomintang became loyal to the prc government in return for this assistance or more cynically that thereafter the communist authorities had tung exactly where they wanted him and where better than as hong kong s chief executive despite the lack of political experience election to the office of chief executive in early 1997 tung won a landslide victory over four other candidates in the election for the post of hong kong s first chief executive the election was conducted by an electoral college of 400 voters it should be noted that hong kong has never had a leader elected by universal suffrage tung s british predecessors were all appointed by the british crown tung subsequently took office as chief executive designate with the assistance of a newly formed cabinet executive council and a few officers seconded from the then hong kong government to help in the preparation of the hksar government the government pledged to focus on three policy areas housing the elderly and education measures on housing included a pledge to provide 85 000 housing flats each year so as to resolve the problems of soaring property prices the asian financial crisis that hit hong kong in months after tung took office made this objective almost immediately redundant and in fact it was a collapse in property prices that became a far more pressing problem in the years between 1998 and 2002 first term tung formally took office on july 1 1997 with a high initial popularity among the public nevertheless a few months after the regional economy deteriorated rapidly after the asian financial crisis with job losses and plummeting values in the stock and property markets people started to lose faith in tung and the hksar government some commentators attributed the plunge in the property market to his counter indicated home building initiative during tung s first term the government came up with a number of reform proposals and plenty of grand infrastructure projects were proposed including a technology park a science park a chinese medicine centre and a disney theme park he was hauled over hot coals notably by then president jiang zemin for a number of high handed decisions namely his decision to grant the cyberport project to richard li son of tycoon li ka shing without the benefit of an open tender the way in which the walt disney company s land grant for its theme park on a 50 year lease meddled with the market and for studying the possibility of setting up a casino in hong kong but too often his administration was seen as bungling particularly during the confusion of the first days of the new airport the mis handling of the avian flu epidemic declining standards due to education reforms specifically teaching in the cantonese mother tongue and mandatory english examination for teachers the right of abode issue and his disagreement of political views with the popular then chief secretary anson chan tung s popularity plummeted with the economy to 47 satisfaction at the end of august 2002 second term tung chee hwa with nominations from 714 members of the electoral college was uncontested in the election for a second term according to the chief executive election ordinance nominations from at least 100 members of the 800 strong electoral college are required for each candidate nevertheless tung could not erase from the public s mind the perception that he is a simpleton guiding a rudderless ship accountability system in an attempt to resolve the difficulties in governance tung reformed the structure of government substantially starting from his second term in 2002 in a system popularly called the principal officials accountability system all principal officials including the chief secretary financial secretary secretary for justice and head of government bureaux would no longer be politically neutral career civil servants instead they would all be political appointees chosen by the chief executive the system was portrayed as the key to solve previous administrative problems notably the cooperation of high ranking civil servants with the chief executive under the new system all heads of bureaux became members of the executive council and came directly under the chief executive instead of the chief secretary or the financial secretary the heads of the liberal party and democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong two pro government parties in the legislative council were also appointed into the executive council to form a ruling alliance a de facto coalition this practically shut out the pro democratic parties and individuals crisis of governance in 2003 the first major move of tung in his second term was to push for legislation to implement article 23 of the hong kong basic law in september 2002 however the initiative drew a hostile response from the pro democratic camp lawyers journalists religious leaders and human rights organisations this stoked public concerns that the freedoms they enjoyed would deteriorate the sentiment together with other factors such as the sars epidemic in early 2003 when the government was criticised for its slow response strained hospital services and the unexpected death toll resulted in the largest mass demonstration since the establishment of hksar with an estimated 500 000 people out of the population of 6 800 000 marching on 1 july 2003 many demanded tung to step down in response to the protests the leader of the liberal party james tien resigned from the executive council on evening july 6 signifying the withdrawal of the party s support for the bill implementing article 23 as a result the government had to postpone and later withdraw the bill from the legislative agenda on july 17 2003 regina ip the then secretary for security who was responsible for implementing article 23 resigned for personal reasons another principal official finance secretary antony leung who earlier suffered from a scandal over his purchase of a luxury vehicle weeks prior to his introduction of a car sales tax which was dubbed as the lexusgate scandal resigned on the same day it was the most serious crisis of tung s administration and some considered it a break up of the short lived ruling alliance the events also boosted civil awareness among the public and the popularity of the pro democratic camp tung s government subsequently encountered difficulties in implementing many of its policies due to opposition from the so called pro democratic camp subsequent developments during the debate over hong kong s constitutional development tung was criticised as not reflecting effectively the views of the general population to push for 2007 08 universal suffrage to the prc government although the primary target of popular opposition was the prc government tung s lack of support for the pro democratic camp resulted in his low approval ratings in late 2003 in an attempt to bring back vistors

concerts hk 100m bill for the taxpayers with the government investhk and the american chamber of commerce blamimg each other for the monumental flop tung s cabinet suffered another blow in july 2004 when another principal official the secretary for health welfare food dr yeoh eng kiong resigned on july 7 to take political responsibility for the government s handling of the sars outbreak in 2003 after the release of the investigation report of legco over the issue in late 2004 the tung administration was rocked by another embarrassment as the large planned sale of government owned real estate the link reit was cancelled at the last moment by a lawsuit by a tenant from an affected estate this incident furthered popular perceptions that the tung administration was inept given that tung had already been chief executive for over seven years at this point tung could no longer demonstrate control over his political agenda with the subsequent improvement in the economy over 2004 unemployment fell and the long period of deflation ended this resulted in a decrease in public discontent as the government s popularity improved and popular support for the democratic movement dwindled with a protest in january attracting a mere few thousand protesters compared to the july 1 protests of 2003 and 2004 however the popularity of tung himself remained low compared to his deputies including donald tsang and henry tang resignation tung s reputation suffered further damage when hu jintao gave him a humiliating public dressing down for poor governance in december 2004 official sources specifically cited the poor handling of the link reit listing the west kowloon cultural project the hung hom flats episode tung himself denied it was a dressing down and insisted that he retained the president s support although he and the rest of the government were asked to examine their past inadequacies hu s words however was thinly veiled criticism nevertheless in his january 2005 policy address tung gave a rather critical verdict on his own performance the speculation which was running rife in the weeks in the run up to his actual resignation and its intensity continued to perpetuate the impression of tung s weakness and confusion prior to tung s resignation in mid february stanley ho a tycoon with close ties with beijing had already commented on the possible candidates for the next chief executive and personally endorsing donald tsang this started rumours that tung would be nominated to the election of vice chairman of chinese people s political consultative conference

declined to comment when questioned by journalists waiting at the government headquarters on march 10 2005 tung assembled a press conference at the central government offices and announced that he had tendered his resignation due to health problems leg according to him after flying to beijing on march 11 tung was elected vice chairman of the chinese people s political consultative conference cppcc on march 12 2005 the last day of cppcc annual meeting his resignation as the chief executive of hong kong was endorsed by the central people s government on the same day the press speculated this

term of two years or start a new term of five years awards tung was awarded a grand bauhinia medal in 2006 some hong kong people thought that awarding tung the grand bauhinia medal was an insult to

brigitte attended the omar and abou bakr mosques in the poor and largely immigrant paris banlieue of couronnes to study both islam and arabic the mosques was infamous for preaching a mixture of militant and puritanical islamist dogma infused with anti imperialist and anti western sentiments it was in couronnes that brigitte came in contact with persons with links to the algerian based salafist group for preaching and combat he was taken on oddly strenuous camping trips believed by french intelligence to be designed by islamist recruiters to identify suitable fighters it is believed

changes in one economic sector may have an effect on other sectors leontief won a nobel prize in economics in 1973 biography early life wassily leontief was a son of wassily w leontief professor of economics and eugenia bekker w leontief sr belonged to a dynasty of old believer merchants living in st petersburg since 1741 eugenia bekker belonged to a wealthy jewish family from odessa at 15 wassily jr entered the university of leningrad in present day st petersburg in 1921 he earned his learned economist degree equivalent to master of arts in 1924 at the age of 19 opposition to communism w leontief sided with campaigners for academic autonomy freedom of speech and in support of pitirim sorokin as a consequence he was detained several times by cheka in 1925 he was allowed to leave the ussr mostly because cheka believed that he is mortally ill sarcoma later the diagnosis appeared to be a medical error he continued his studies at the university of berlin and in 1928 he earned a ph d degree in economics with a dissertation on circular flows in economics early professional life from 1927 to 1930 he worked at the institute for world economics of the university of kiel there he researched the derivation of statistical demand and supply curves in 1929 he travelled to china to assist the ministry of railroads as an advisor in 1931 he went to the united states and was employed by the national bureau of economic research during world war ii leontief served as consultant at the office of strategic services marriage and affiliation with harvard in 1932 leontief married the poet estelle marks his wife died in 2005 their only child svetlana leontief alpers was born in 1936 harvard university employed him in the same year 1932 in its department of economics and in 1946 he became a professor of economics around 1949 leontief used the primitive computer systems available at the time at harvard to model data provided by the u s bureau of labor statistics to divide the u s economy into 500 sectors leontief modeled each sector with a linear equation based on the data and used the computer the harvard mark ii to solve the system one of the first significant uses of computers for mathematical modeling leontief set up the harvard economic research project in 1948 and remained its director until 1973 starting in 1965 he chaired the harvard society of fellows affiliation with new york university in 1975 leontief joined new york university and founded and directed the institute for economic analysis death leontief died in new york city new york usa on friday february 5 1999 at the age of 93 personal it is known that he enjoyed fly fishing ballet and fine wines he vacationed for years at his farm in vermont but after moving to new york in the 1970 s leontief relocated his summer residence to lakeville connecticut major contributions leontief is primarily associated with the development of the linear activity model of general equilibrium and the use of input output analysis that results from it he has also made contributions in other areas of economics such as international trade where he documented the famous leontief paradox he was also one of the first to establish the composite commodity theorem leontief earned the nobel prize in economics for his work on input output tables input output tables analyze the process by which inputs from one industry produce outputs for consumption or for inputs for another industry with the input output table one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good an unrealistic assumption of this analysis is that input proportions are fixed it is for this reason that the use of input output analysis is limited to rough approximizations rather than prediction input output was novel and inspired large scale empirical work it has been used for economic planning throughout the world whether in western socialist or third world countries leontief used input output analysis to study the characteristics of trade flow between the u s and other countries and found what has been named leontief s paradox this country resorts to foreign trade in order to economize its capital and dispose of its surplus labor rather than vice versa i e u s exports were relatively labor intensive when compared to u s imports this is the opposite of what one would expect considering the fact that the u s s comparative advantage was in capital intensive goods according to some economists this paradox has since been explained as due to the fact that when a country produces more than two goods the abundance of capital relative to labor does not imply that the capital intensity of its exports should exceed that of imports there also exists a trend that can be seen in the u s that could explain leontief s paradox and this is that in the last four decades money has been becoming more expensive while labor has been becom ing cheaper leontief was also a very strong proponent of the use of quantitative data in the study of economics throughout his life leontief campaigned against theoretical assumptions and nonobserved facts according to leontief too many economists were reluctant to get their hands dirty by working with raw empirical facts to that end wassily leontief did much to make quantitative data more accessible and more

the official number of dead is 18 including 8 men five women and five children but other reports indicate that as many as 25 people were killed 14 of the dead were said to be from the same family there is confusion over the actual number killed since reports claims that 13 15 of the dead were buried immediately some sources say this was according to islamic custom others say they were buried without customary funeral arrangements the associated press ap has reported that unnamed pakistani intelligence officials assert that the attack was conducted based on intelligence that al zawahiri was invited to a dinner to mark the islamic holiday of eid al adha at the compound that was targeted while al zawahiri himself did not attend the dinner aides were sent in his place officially the provincial government of bajur where the attack took place has now confirmed that 4 or 5 foreign terrorists were killed in the attack and that 10 or 12 extremists had attended in all the official

rashid ahmed called the attack highly condemnable and said the government wanted to assure the people we will not allow such incidents to reoccur tension remained high throughout tribal areas angry pakistanis protested against the strike claiming it was illegal and that the attack that killed innocent civilians however it now appears that several high ranking al queda terrorists were also killed

are the focus of the show background a chauvinistic and lecherous superhero with a frat boy mentality captain hero is a macho parody of comic book heroes like superman specifically his design is a poke at bruce timm s his first name is leslie though he is embarrassed when people call him that he is the creator of the league of heroes earth s premier superhero team and a parody of the justice league of america originally from the planet zebulon which he later destroyed in a misguided attempt to prove himself his parents had him aborted and sent the fetus hurtling towards the sun when it was revealed that he would be the lamest superhero ever born the pod carrying him went off course though and he ended up surviving and being raised on earth in his other life he fights crime and reports to a city commissioner he has a cave like batman as well as a pillow fort of isolation a parody of superman s fortress of solitude unlike many superheroes hero has spent most of his career without a sidekick because no one else will work with him hero even went so far as to make one up the title character in captain girl out of jealousy though in that same episode wooldoor sockbat eventually becomes his first permanent sidekick despite hero s reputation for being a terrible superhero and despite the fact that many other superheroes clearly exist in the show s reality the world still seems to rely on hero a great deal on several occasions a news anchor has broken off in the midst of reporting on a crisis to exclaim in panic captain hero where are you hero s age is given as 28 in the first season but by the time of captain hero s marriage pact he is at least 30 years old seemingly providing an exception to the rule that cartoon characters never age in xandir and tim sitting in a tree he states in the guise of his alter ego tim tommerson that he has lived for thirty some odd years though never stated explicitly it is strongly implied that he and his parents are jewish as he calls his mother ima hebrew for mother also in plural imahot and has been seen to observe sabbath rituals this is part of a running gag of jewish in jokes throughout the series creators dave jeser and matt silverstein are both jewish since captain hero is a parody of superman these jokes may also be references to similar hints of judaism in superman s background like jeser and silverstein superman creators joe shuster and jerry siegel were both jewish the episode unrestrainable trainable reveals that captain hero has a sister captain she ro who gave birth to his son having gotten hero s sperm from a sperm bank not knowing that the donor was actually her brother as a result of the inadvertent inbreeding their child is a mentally retarded giant that same episode also reveals that hero attended college at howard university a historically black college in washington d c he also attended a superhero college personality hero is extremely dumb prone to making bad jokes whereas he says the same of the qur an in dirty pranking no 2 once tearing out xandir s intestines because he thought xandir was someone else and dressing up as a girl to go to a keg party which resulted in hero being gang raped this later made headlines which announced best kegger ever in the lemon aids walk he bulks up on steroids and perpetrates numerous acts of violence to win a charity event he cries often and frequently dresses and acts like a teenage girl or a woman he also acts like a small child on occasion he likes to rub his own nipples when he is excited or aroused he usually learns a moral at the conclusion of any story although the moral he always learns is extremely minor in comparison to the one he should be learning for example in ghostesses in the slot machine instead of realizing that he shouldn t endanger the world for the sake of personal gain all he takes away from the experience is that indians should not be allowed to have casinos he is prone to shouting the word no very loudly and looking up toward the sky which parodies how comic book characters overdramatize sad situations on their part this joke was used most prominently in terms of endearment hero s catchphrase is save yourselves which he usually shouts while flying away from any situation that throws the housemates into mortal peril many of captain hero s lines resemble those used by superman on the front of old comic covers which portray him as less than sympathetic despite his role as protector of humanity hero displays extremely little reverence for human life in fact his many misdeeds throughout the series carry the stamp of a sociopath though usually it appears that hero just acts without thinking of the consequences as stated above in ghostesses in the slot machine he puts the world at risk to make money on a crooked gambling scheme and in another episode he annihilates his home world of zebulon also mentioned above solely to prove a point to his parents in the lemon aids walk while under the influence of steroids he slaughters the rest of the drawn together household as well as a 12 year old girl and a donkey and later kills or maims all the participants of the aids walk except foxxy believing it is a race in wooldoor sockbat s giggle wiggle funny tickle non traditional progressive multicultural roundtable when the terminator is gunning down patrons in the bar to get to wooldoor hero swoops in and announces that he is going to activate his hero shield then grabs an innocent woman and holds her in front of himself to take the bullets that hero having been mentioned in previous episodes as being impervious to bullets should be able to deflect by himself in spelling applebee s when he discovers that princess clara is sexually aroused by car crashes he causes numerous crashes in order to bring her to orgasm later when he discovers she is actually using him he arranges for her friends to be killed in another crash as an act of revenge then states and remember kids never mess with the emotions of a dangerous lunatic sexuality hero s sexual orientation is debatable at the beginning of the series hero is clearly attracted to women and is portrayed as a sleazy womanizer as the series has progressed however a variety of possibilities have arisen as to his sexual orientation and romantic interests paraphilias in a strictly sexual sense hero embodies pansexuality he has been shown to be sexually aroused by such a wide variety of paraphilias that his sexuality cannot be classified by any narrow scope in the pilot episode he is aroused upon seeing princess clara and foxxy love make out in the hot tub indicating either heterosexuality or bisexuality in that same episode under the impression that the house grants wishes after he wishes for a hot black chick the african american foxxy love coincidentally enters hero wishes for a 12 year old girl and a donkey indications that hero is both a pedophile and a zoophile later in that episode he indicates that being dead would not stop him from fondling a woman suggesting he is open to necrophilia in the first season episode gay bash it is revealed that he had a one night stand with bizarro captain hero his evil twin from a parallel universe whom he subsequently murders to keep the affair a secret in the other cousin captain hero participates in an all male game of spin the bottle then makes a bet that he can seduce clara s mentally retarded female cousin which he does in the second season premiere he proclaims of strawberry sweetcake a guest character who looks like an eight year old here s to the teeniest ass you can tap without setting off an amber alert in the same episode he can be seen penetrating a giraffe during an orgy in the episode lost in parking space part one he also simulates sex with an imaginary boy scout further indicating that he is a pedophile in the season two episode captain hero s marriage pact he expresses glee over the prospect of marathon sex with unusually flexible girl a rare season two nod to hero s heterosexual side in that same episode wooldoor not understanding an innuendo hero made toward ufg asks him are you gonna have sex with her or take a poopy hero replies if all goes well both this indicates he is into coprophilia as well another second season episode little orphan hero gives great insight into hero s wide range of paraphilias early in the episode hero builds a robot to use for sex programs it to feel pain then forces himself upon it later he drugs xandir with chloroform and rapes his unconscious body which hero believes erases people s memories a parody of superman s kiss erasing lois lane s memory in the film superman ii later in the same episode hero chloroforms his own parents and commits incest by raping their unconscious bodies this episode also indicates that hero indulges in transvestism as he dresses in heavy makeup a halter top and cutoff skirt in order to attend a keg party where he himself is gang raped it is implied in the episode unrestrainable trainable that he commits incest with his sister though all that is shown is the interior of her uterus in the episode n r a y ray he states that he is dating bambi s dead mother further implying necrophilia and zoophilia in the episode super nanny the eponymous super nanny notes the presence of wadded up tissues and a book of crime scene photos under hero s bed another nod to necrophilia in the one wherein there is a big twist part ii he takes several pictures of foxxy love tied up and covered in honey and some tissues calling them evidence and taking them to the hero cave in the episode a tale of two cows hero states that he has taken a shine to wooldoor s friend live action cow stating that he has always dreamed of meeting a woman with six penises further suggesting that he is indeed a zoophile in addition to his paraphilias hero is also an aficionado of bdsm and derives great pleasure from being physically punished despite his personal aggressiveness he tends to take the submissive role in sexual relationships captain hero s rampant desire for sex also means he is not above lying to get it in lost in parking space part one he is depicted having sex with a woman after convincing her that the fin rot he caught from aquaman had cleared up when it hadn t in the creator commentary for the episode jess harnell and the show s creators speculate that he simply seeks sexual gratification regardless of the means by which and with whom or with what he attains it however they suggest that his preference is towards anything as long as it s helpless orientation and romantic interests as far as emotional relationships and actual romantic attachment go as opposed to his encounters of a purely sexual nature however hero s gender preferences are considerably more complicated in the show s first season a running gag involved dropping references to hero possibly being a bisexual or closeted homosexual when the show s creators decided in season two to begin developing captain hero s character however they used the history of gay references to form an actual character arc for hero wherein he is either a bisexual or a homosexual in severe denial the main focus of hero s closeted sexuality is fellow housemate xandir whom he both mocks and seems to be good friends with he has been shown bathing with xandir and once even complimented xandir on his penis in the episode unrestrainable trainable he walks around the house wearing only his pajama shirt while xandir wears the bottoms despite or perhaps because of his possible homosexuality hero is extremely homophobic and desperate not to be thought of as gay himself hero suffers from a self induced form of multiple personality disorder as a result of this inner conflict creating separate personalities as an outlet for the parts of himself he does not want to acknowledge the most notable instance of this featured as the main plotline in xandir and tim sitting in a tree is his alter ego tim tommerson who expresses hero s pent up homosexual urges particularly for xandir this gay version of hero is hyper feminine speaking in a falsetto voice and assuming the bottom role in the relationship after having sex with xandir hero rebels against his own alternate personality severing his own finger and beating himself then finally ordering his tim persona to leave tim convinces xandir to shoot captain hero claiming that to do so will metaphorically kill off his homophobic side and allow the real person tim to take over however tim ends up being the one who gets shot hero claims that tim s death proves hero isn t gay after all indicating that hero intends to remain in denial about his true sexuality in wooldoor sockbat s giggle wiggle funny tickle non traditional progressive multicultural roundtable hero forms a friendship with the terminator though it becomes quickly apparent that something more is going on between them even as their relationship grows more and more to resemble a gay male romance hero states proudly several times that they are indeed heterosexual and makes continual references how much he loves vaginas serving as further evidence of his denial at the end of the episode they kiss hero at times has shown romantic affection for women in the other cousin he develops real feelings for clara s cousin bleh and in spelling applebee s he develops a crush on princess clara herself in both cases his feelings are portrayed as being emotional in nature rather than sexual showing he is capable of emotional relationships with both men and women however hero continues to display a confused and conflicted sexual attitude in the aforementioned spelling applebee s while he is on a date with clara hero proceeds to make out with a male waiter and is unable to understand why she is upset by this to further underscore either his homophobia or possible homosexuality and emphasize his masculinity the emblem on his chest looks like the male gender symbol curiously enough his sister s costume also has the same symbol role on the show of all the housemates captain hero is the one who has seen the most character development over the series after being a fairly minor character in the first season he was as jess harnell puts it an overgrown frat guy whose libido was his main source of humor he has grown considerably more complex consequently his role has expanded exponentially to the point where now he is now the most frequently used character on the show the other cousin was the first episode to focus on hero but it was the second season episode little orphan hero that proved to be a major turning point for the character in the episode hero after suffering a nervous breakdown meets his parents for the first time and sees many long dormant emotional issues rise to the surface subsequent episodes would expand on these developments by the time of a very special drawn together afterschool special it seems perfectly natural for hero as xandir s mother to be cast in the role of the sensitive and caring if overly emotional nurturer original artwork in original

 id=57987 title rudolf carnap nonfiltered 887 processed 876 dbindex 1560898 rudolf carnap may 18 1891 ronsdorf germany september 14 1970 santa monica california was an influential philosopher who was active in central europe before 1935 and in the united states thereafter he was a leading member of the vienna circle and a prominent advocate of logical positivism life carnap was born in a north german family that had been humble until his parents generation he began his formal education at the barmen gymnasium from 1910 to 1914 he attended the university of jena intending to write a thesis in physics but he also carefully studied kant s critique of pure reason in a course taught by bruno bauch and was one of very few students to take frege s courses in mathematical logic after serving in the german army during ww i for three years he was given permission to study physics at the university of berlin 1917 18 where albert einstein was a newly appointed professor carnap then attended the university of freiburg where he wrote a thesis setting out an axiomatic theory of space and time the physics department said it was too philosophical and bruno bauch of the philosophy department said it was pure physics carnap then wrote another thesis under bauch s supervision on the theory of space from a more orthodox kantian point of view published as carnap 1922 in 1921 carnap wrote a fateful letter to bertrand russell who responded by copying out by hand long passages from his principia mathematica for carnap s benefit as neither carnap nor freiburg could afford a copy of this epochal work in 1924 and 1925 he attended seminars led by edmund husserl the founder of phenomenology and continued to write on physics from a logical positivist perspective carnap discovered a kindred spirit when he met hans reichenbach at a 1923 conference reichenbach introduced carnap to moritz schlick a professor at the university of vienna who offered carnap a position in his department which carnap took up in 1926 carnap thereupon joined an informal group of viennese intellectuals that came to be called the vienna circle led by moritz schlick and including hans hahn friedrich waismann otto neurath and herbert feigl with occasional appearances by hahn s student kurt gödel when wittgenstein visited vienna carnap would meet with him he with hahn and neurath wrote the 1929 manifesto of the circle and with hans reichenbach founded the philosophy journal erkenntnis in 1928 carnap published two important books the logical structure of the world in which he developed a rigorous formal version of empiricism defining all scientific terms in phenomenalistic terms the formal system of the aufbau as this book is often called by virtue of the first word of its german title was grounded in a single primitive dyadic predicate which is satisfied if two individuals resemble each other the aufbau was greatly influenced by principia mathematica and warrants comparison with the mereotopological metaphysics a n whitehead developed over 1916 29 it appears however that carnap soon became somewhat disenchanted with this book in particular he did not authorize an english translation until 1967 pseudoproblems in philosophy asserted that many philosophical questions were meaningless i e the way they were posed amounted to an abuse of language an operational implication of this radical stance was taken to be the elimination of metaphysics from responsible human discourse this is the notorious position for which carnap was best known for many years in february 1930 tarski lectured in vienna and in november 1930 carnap visited warsaw on these occasions he learned much about tarski s model theoretic approach to semantics in 1931 carnap was appointed professor at the german language university of prague there he wrote the book that was to make him the most famous logical positivist and member of the vienna circle his logical syntax of language carnap 1934 in 1933 willard quine met carnap in prague and discussed the latter s work at some length thus began the lifelong mutual respect these two men shared one that survived quine s eventual forceful disagreements with a number of carnap s philosophical conclusions carnap under no illusions about what the third reich was about to unleash on europe and whose socialist and pacifist convictions made him a marked man emigrated to the united states in 1935 and became a naturalized citizen in 1941 meanwhile back in vienna moritz schlick was assassinated in 1936 from 1936 to 1952 carnap was a professor of philosophy at the university of chicago thanks in part to quine s good offices carnap spent the years 1939 41 at harvard where he was reunited with tarski carnap 1963 later expressed some irritation about his time at chicago where he and charles w morris were the only members of the department committed to the primacy of science and logic their chicago colleagues included richard mckeon mortimer adler charles hartshorne and manley thompson carnap s years at chicago were nonetheless highly productive ones he wrote books on semantics carnap 1942 1943 1956 modal logic coming very close in carnap 1956 to the now standard possible worlds semantics for that logic saul kripke proposed starting in 1959 and on the philosophical foundations of probability and induction carnap 1950 1952 after a stint at the institute for advanced study at princeton he joined the philosophy department at ucla in 1954 hans reichenbach having died the previous year he had earlier declined an offer of a similar position at the university of california because taking up that position required that he sign a mccarthy era loyalty oath a practice to which he was opposed on principle while at ucla he wrote on scientific knowledge the analytic synthetic dichotomy and the verification principle his writings on thermodynamics and on the foundations of probability and induction were published posthumously as carnap 1971 1977 1980 carnap taught himself esperanto when he was a mere fourteen years of age and remained very sympathetic to it carnap 1963 he later attended a world congress of esperanto and employed the language while traveling carnap had four children by his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1929 his second wife committed suicide in 1964 logician a good introduction to carnap the logician is his introduction to symbolic logic with applications 1958 there we find fair attention paid to a number of philosophical points logic texts often slight an indifference to metatheory a fascination with formalized semantics a casual attitude about proof and no mention of natural deduction close attention paid to the logic of relations many interesting examples of axiomatic theories many formulated in second order logic a great debt owed to principia mathematica philosophy for a precis of carnap s philosophical conclusions click here see also logical positivism

incident in bagram afghanistan that wasn t his fault although he was granted a full discharge by the court he was disengaged from afghanistan and demoted to a five star office job embittered shetland left the marine corps shortly after the incident sued the u s military and won he used the proceeds from his lawsuit 700 000 to found the private security corporation displace international displace international was highly successful eventually becoming a major private military contractor for the u s government as well as the first private security company to be listed on the fortune 500 shetland was held hostage at the u s embassy by indonesian guerrillas led by suhadi sadono only to be rescued by his friend sam fisher shetland and fisher would later perform a joint operation against sadono s kundang camp in which shetland provided tactical support with displace personnel and helped facilitate fisher s extraction shetland appears again in chaos theory when third echelon comes to suspect that rogue elements within displace international are covertly attempting to goad the united states and north korea into war against each other it is ultimately revealed that shetland himself is the mastermind behind the scheme shetland organized payment to hugo lacerda to interrogate bruce morgonholt and retrieved the masse kernels from the first game killing abrahim zherkezhi who worked with morgonholt on the kernels shetland used the algorithms to cause blackouts in new york city and japan as well as launched a north korean missile that with the help of an algorithm that crippled the ship s defensive systems successfully destroyed the uss clarence e walsh sparking an armed conflict involving the korean peninsula japan and the united states fisher is eventually sent to japan in order to eliminate his old friend and prevent the spread of the weaponized algorithms after a meeting to sell i sdf the algorithms declines into a firefight fisher pursues shetland and the two end up facing off in a tense mexican standoff in which shetland expresses his outrage at the politicians and bureaucrats and their dirty little wars that have left america sick and dying he tells fisher about the need to tear it down and start over and implores fisher to join him however fisher is forced to kill shetland even if sam puts away his gun instead of shooting him shetland attempts to kill fisher and fisher is forced to stab him sarah fisher sarah is sam s daughter and he loves her more than anything in the world sam tries to contact her whenever he can before or after his missions she knows that he has a job in the government but due to the covert nature of his occupation she is barely allowed to know where he is sam doesn t get to see her that much due to his trips unfortunately she is run down and killed by a drunk driver sam is devastated by her death and goes into deep depression even picking fights in the street fisher took his mission in double agent 360 version because he had nothing left to lose splinter cell kombayn nikoladze kombayn nikoladze is the primary antagonist of tom clancy s splinter cell a charismatic and powerful industrialist nikoladze was elected president of georgia following the assassination of the previous president in a suicide bomb attack although appearing to be pro western and a democrat nikoladze hid a hatred of america and aggressive military ambitions after commissioning russian mercenary vyacheslav grinko to retrain the georgian army in covert guerrilla warfare nikoladze engaged in a secret military campaign in the neighbouring muslim nation of azerbaijan in order to seize control of the country s vast oil reserves knowing that the west would take military action against him if they became aware of his operation nikoladze employed canadian hacker philip masse whose information warfare techniques managed to hide evidence of the invasion from intelligence gathering organisations by the time sam fisher s infiltration of the georgian ministry of defence had uncovered evidence of the campaign georgian commandos had almost completely overthrown azerbaijan with nikoladze s crimes brought to the attention of the world nato engages in military action against georgia pushing georgian commandos from azerbaijan and forcing nikoladze to go underground in retaliation nikoladze uses highly advanced information warfare algorithms developed by masse to attack america in what would later be called the georgian information crisis masse s attacks targeted military and computer systems as well as transportation and other infrastructure causing widespread disruption and death during the crisis nikoladze posted webcasts mocking america s efforts and threatening destruction knowing that he would never be able to fight the united states directly nikoladze dispersed cells of the georgian army across the world and made plans to launch a devastating strike after making a secret alliance with chinese general kong feirong the head of a splinter faction within the people s liberation army nikoladze s commandos seized nuclear material from a power plant in the kola peninsula of russia kong feirong and his loyal troops seized control of the chinese embassy in myanmar near the abattoir where nikoladze was hiding the captured nuclear material was transported to the embassy where kong feirong s men adapted it for military use although sam fisher destroyed the nuclear material kept by feirong nikoladze was able to smuggle a sadm christened the ark into washington following the defeat of his information warfare campaign grinko and feirong nikoladze made a deal with the new georgian president varlem cristavi that he be allowed to return to the georgian presidential palace for reasons that he did not specify however cristavi had learnt that nikoladze sought to return was to recover a key to the ark and made plans to double cross him georgian special forces gunned down nikoladze s guards as he was about to recover the key in the interests of self preservation nikoladze agreed to provide the new georgian government with the ark and it s key in return for sparing his life however before he could give the location of the device to president cristavi nikoladze was sniped from across a courtyard by sam fisher at the conclusion of the game s final mission because of the mysterious circumstances of his death sightings and rumours of his survival would abound for several years philip masse philip masse was a canadian computer hacker who was hired by president nikoladze to disrupt information networks to allow georgian commandos to invade azerbeijan unnoticed afterwards he played a major role in disrupting american computer networks as part of an incident known as the georgian information crisis he was assassinated by sam fisher in a later mission that was hinted at in chaos theory masse used unique tricks and strategies in computer hacking including a new method of encryption known as five twelve the united nations created a committee known as project watson to determine how masse carried out his operations in splinter cell chaos theory the techniques masse used became known as the masse kernels and were considered revolutionary methods of information warfare so much that sam fisher was dispatched specifically to prevent that information from being spread vyacheslav grinko vyacheslav grinko is a former spetznaz russian special forces soldier working as a mercenary for kombayn nikoladze grimsdottir also speculates that in the early 1990s he may have worked as a sniper in azerbaijan gaining seven confirmed kills grinko is responsible for orchestrating the military elements of nikoladze s campaign including the planned executions of captured us soldiers and chinese dignitaries one of whom was ambassador long dan on television he is killed in a firefight with sam fisher in an abattoir in myanmar before the executions could be carried out general kong feirong kong feirong is a rogue general leading a rogue faction of the chinese army he allied himself with kombayn nikoladze to start a war between china and america however after the failure of the abattoir executions nikoladze abandoned him the chinese government learned of his treason and attacked the embassy beaten kong got himself drunk and even shot his own men sam fisher interrogated him and made him reveal files of his involvement and the weapon called the ark kong died soon after that by committing suicide by drinking poison long dan long dan is featured during the georgian information crisis in the first splinter cell he is the chinese ambassador to myanmar and is being held captive at a slaughter house mouke tsoe bo meats in yangon he speaks to fisher telling him about a rogue chinese general it is hinted in a data stick that vyacheslav grinko tortured long dan in order to get him to translate what the chinese officials were talking about between each other the second time he appears is during chaos theory he is the chinese ambassador to the u n trying to broker a peace deal between north and south korea and for his actions he is awarded the nobel peace prize hamlet grinko s personal driver sam interogates him for information on grinko s meeting with masse after that the player can choose to kill him if he wants to but lambert will get angry if he does though it doesn t affect much at all dr john e baxter an nsa interrogations expert baxter is sent with wilkes to the cia hq in langley to begin interrogate the cia mole mitchell doughearty once fisher has him in custody they are chatted up by a security agent on the cia grounds though he is merely being friendly as nsa members sam fisher who is dressed in ninja outfit not looking very friendly are allowed on cia properties he is mentioned in the chaos theory co op campaign where he assists in the interrogation of jong pom chu but is never seen mitchell dougherty a cia analyst working inadvertently with the georgians dougherty s ocd caused him to store his work on a personal laptop his laptop not being nearly secure as the cias mainframe was hacked by the georgians techies georgian technician piotr even confirmed that dougherty did not know what trouble he had caused as a result of tracking down the leak from the cia main server fisher abducts dougherty for interrogation by the nsa when he goes for a smoke break it is unknown what happened to him after that it is also unknown whether the cia found out that dougherty s carelessness caused the information attacks piotr lejava a technician on the oil rig carrying an important briefcase that sam must retrieve using any means necessary the player can interrogate him knock him out or kill him to get the briefcase if they choose to on any of these three options thomas gurgenidze a contact for sam in his first mission he told sam why the cia agents he was assigned to rescue vanished they were later found dead in a morgue thomas is killed after he was crushed by falling debris after three russian mafiosos set fire to the warehouse he was in fisher found him pinned underneath fallen objects tried to call for an evac but thomas was too far gone he died before he could fully convey a rather important message to sam ivan a surviving russian programmer in the kalinetek building he hid in one of the bathrooms calling the 911 emergency he was reconnected to grim after three transfers to come rescue him in return he will reveal what the georgians are up to a mafiaso finds him just before sam comes in time to save ivan unfortunetly for ivan sam came only for his encryption key and ivan is forced to continue hiding varlam cristavi cristavi becomes the georgian acting president after kombayn nikoladze is removed from office he orders the georgian guards at the presidential palace to kill nikoladize s men and retrieve the ark for themselves fisher s intervention results in the failure of this plan as well as the deaths of some of cristavi s guards cristavi remains president of georgia in 2006 andrei alekseevich a mercenary colonel for the georgian military forces alekseevich was in charge of the kola cell in russia and was smuggling nuclear warheads in the submarine vselka he is friends with phillip masse and is present in the cell when fisher infiltrates the base during this mission alekseevich is forced by fisher to operate a retinal scanner to open a locked door sam grabs andrei and forces him to open a retinal scanner locked door sam can kill him after that by knocking him out and shooting him in the head anna grimsdóttír refers to alekseevich as a soviet darth vader splinter cell pandora tomorrow dermot brunton d p brunton is the operations coordinator of shadownet in splinter cell pandora tomorrow he has a similar role to irving lambert providing sam fisher with mission objectives and intelligence over the radio during some of the game s missions as his operations specifically prohibit live satellite contact between coordinator and operatives dermot s function is more bureaucratic and managerial lambert heavily dislikes brunton and even threatens to demote him to mop duty when required information does not arrive on time additionally anna grimsdóttír thinks that lambert would love to smash him sometimes he has not been seen or mentioned in the sequels so it s unknown what happened to brunton suhadi sadono suhadi sadono is the leader of a radical indonesian guerilla group known as the darah dan doa blood and prayer and the main antagonist of splinter cell pandora tomorrow sadono has been in the darah dan doa since he was 15 years old he was trained by the cia to help fight communist influences in the region but felt betrayed when the americans stopped backing indonesia and put their support behind east timor instead even establishing permanent military bases in east timor to widen their influence over the region resentful of the american interference in his country s autonomy sadano eventually decides to declare war on america in the beginning of splinter cell pandora tomorrow suhadi personally leads a squad of guerillas in an attack on the american embassy in east timor taking dozens of hostages including sam fisher s old friend douglas shetland it is revealed later in the game that sadano has acquired samples of the smallpox virus and placed a series of viral bombs across the united states threatening to detonate the bombs and release the virus if he is ever killed or captured he calls this scheme pandora tomorrow when sam fisher succeeds in disabling the threat of pandora tomorrow sadano prepares to go underground and wage an extended terrorist campaign against america using periodic videotaped statements to call for a world revolution against the us before he can implement his plan sadano is abducted by sam fisher and handed over to the cia for trial norman soth norman soth is another major antagonist in splinter cell pandora tomorrow as well as the final opponent in the game he is a cia field agent who participated in operation redbeard establishing us friendly terrorist cells in indonesia to fight communism one of these cells was the darah dan doa led by suhadi sadono however the u s government pulled support of operation redbeard and ended up supporting the timorese leaving soth on his own soth was subsequently severely injured in a land mine explosion losing his left leg two of his fingers and part of his left ear lobe he had his lost leg replaced with an advanced robotic prothesis soth eventually went underground and aligned himself with sadono and the ddd becoming sadano s chief mercenary however soth had no interest in sadano s cause and merely wanted to strike back at america for betraying him earlier after sadono is captured soth takes the last nd 133 canister filled with the smallpox virus and plans to release it at lax sam fisher confronts soth inside lax and kills him in a shootout ingrid karlthson ingrid karlthson born october 24 1965 in atlanta first came in contact with sam fisher while she was a hostage in the darah dan doa s raid on the u s embassy in east timor in 2006 she is a desk jockey and provides a translation for a file fisher received which leads him to the saulnier cryogenics lab and later norman soth it is later revealed that karlthson is actually a deep cover agent planted at the embassy to discern whether or not soth was still an agency asset he was so deep undercover that even the cia didn t know if he was still working for them she is taken by sadono as a bargaining chip and is taken to the tv station in jakarta where she assists fisher in capturing sadono francis coldeboeuf francis coldeboeuf was a security guard at the saulnier cyrogenics lab back in 2003 he was arrested for invasion of privacy by taking a picture with his cellphone camera however when norman soth s mercenaries took over the building he was the only survivor and went into hiding in secured body processing center managing to take soth s picture on his phone s camera before the mercenaries manage to break into the room fisher reaches him but only for his cellphone for information and a picture of mortified penguin soth afterward fisher saves coldeboeuf from being blown up by the mercenaries by shooting off a valve and saturating the mercenaries with a gas used by the cryogenics lab the exposure to the gas kills the mercenaries before they can detonate their makeshift bomb coldeboeuf s status after the incident is not known it should be noted that fisher can either save him or blow up the makeshift bomb with a fragmentation grenade to avoid the full blast killing coldeboeuf however lambert will react coldly to this and tell fisher that he s up for a visit a shrink either way francis s living or dying does not mean anything to future missions saul berkovitz sam s first contact in israel he gets taken hostage by two thieves who demand his guns and money sam quickly disposes of these two and saul gives sam a modified version of his sc 20k if the player chooses to saul will lead sam to an area where he can test out his new weapon azrul arifin sam s cia contact in deep cover as sadono s private pilot sam plants a bomb on his plane and then later meets up with azrul to get a code word from him then warns azrul to stay away from his plane dahlia tal dahlia tal is an undercover agent of the shin bet israeli secret police who had infiltrated a syrian terrorist group by pretending to be a corrupt member of mossad she assists sam fisher during a mission inside israel in splinter cell pandora tomorrow in cooperation with third echelon she leads sam fisher through the streets of jerusalem to the terrorist group s headquarters while helping him evade israeli police patrols however when the two of them finally reach the terrorist headquarters lambert radios fisher and orders him to execute dahlia immediately the player is then given the option of either shooting dahlia or ignoring lambert s order if the player complies and kills dahlia lambert refuses to tell fisher why he had just been ordered to shoot an unarmed woman fisher voices his objections but lambert refuses to discuss the matter any further if the player chooses to spare dahlia she evades fisher and lambert will angrily denounce fisher telling him it s not your job to question lambert will reveal that shin bet has double crossed third echelon and that they are planning on killing fisher as soon as he retrieves the smallpox virus from the terrorists because israel wants to steal the viral weapon for themselves he also explains that dahlia is a sharpshooter with sniper stats that could disprove kennedy assassination theories sure enough dahlia and 3 other shin bet snipers ambush fisher as soon as he exits the terrorist base fisher can kill all 4 of them and escapes splinter cell chaos theory admiral toshiro otomo admiral otomo is one of the main antagonists in splinter cell chaos theory he was the head of japan s i sdf information self defense force whilst otomo appeared to be trying to assist the nsa in resolving the east asian crisis and stopping the war that had broken out between north korea south korea and the usa he was in fact one of its primary architects otomo and the i sdf had been working with douglas shetland and using information warfare algorithims belonging to displace international the i sdf had launched an attack on an american ship from a north korea missile battery when the nsa realised that the i sdf was working with shetland otomo a fierce nationalist sealed the i sdf s base of operations and demanded that the japanese government suspend japan s constitution and return power to the emperor and the armed forces when the japanese government refused these demands otomo attempted to fire a north korean nuclear missile upon a japanese city knowing that the people of japan would demand retaliation in the event of such an attack the launch was stopped by sam fisher who destroyed the i sdf s servers and thus their capability to launch information warfare attacks after attempting to commit seppuku by stabbing himself with a blade otomo was rescued by fisher and bought before a u n war tribunal where his honour dictated that he admit his actions and plead guilty frank mason frank mason is the secretary of defense under president bowers during the events of splinter cell chaos theory in response to north korea and china s blockade of japan mason sent the uss clarence e walsh to the yellow sea to reaffirm the us commitments to japan later mason joined bowers and lambert in deciding the course of action to take place over the several days after the sinking of the walsh mason uses a very hardline approach when dealing with problems while he encouraged the president to send out troops and at one point to use nuclear devices to stop the korea conflict lambert managed to talk him down preventing a terrible crisis captain arthur partridge arthur partridge was captain of the uss clarence e walsh and one of the navy s top commanders on course to become an admiral a longtime friend of sam fisher s partridge was his commanding officer for a short time when sam was a navy seal and the two maintained a good relationship over the years partridge captained the walsh into the yellow sea under orders of the president he was killed along with his crew when a hijacked north korean silkworm anti ship missile hit and sunk the ship the walsh was more than capable of defending against the attack but a masse kernel related attack crippled it leading to an antiquated type of missile being able to send it straight to the bottom milan nedi h real name milos nowak milan nedi h was a ranking member of displace international and was in charge of the abrahim zherkezhi and bruce morgenholt protection details initially believed to be responsible for playing both the us and displace over morgenholt s death and the masse kernels it is later discovered that he was working under orders from douglas shetland displace s ceo nedi h s real name is milos nowak a wanted war criminal from the bosnian conflict he was known as the barber of bosnia due to allegedly scalping a number of his prisoners nedich was eventually killed by sam fisher by breaking his back with his knee after interrogating him in a hokkaid mountain retreat in japan hugo lacerda hugo lacerda was a peruvian separatist revolutionary and the leader of a communist guerilla organization called the people s voice he is responsible for the kidnapping and murder of american computational theorist bruce morgenholt but leaves his island fortress hideout before fisher can find and kill him lacerda boards the maria narcissa guarded by a pair of displace bodyguards however fisher is able to infiltrate the maria narcissa and interrogate lacerda over morgenholt s death lacerda himself dies when sam breaks his back with his knee pleading for his life abrahim zherkezhi abrahim zherkezhi was a computer genius and worked with dr bruce morgenholt in studying the masse kernels for the un following the georgian information crises and then abruptly disappeared from public life it is later learned that zherkezhi had taken protection from displace international he allowed douglas shetland to use his dvorak algorithms though unaware of shetland s intentions after the blackouts of the eastern coast and japan sam fisher was sent to zherkezhi s penthouse to locate the dvorak only to learn it was an infinite state machine fisher also learned displace relocated zherkezhi to hokkaid while fisher attempted to kidnap zherkezhi shetland arrived beforehand and murdered zherkezhi with a katana in the hokkaid retreat to hide evidence of his involvement bruce morgenholt bruce morgenholt worked alongside abrahim zherkezhi is studying the masse kernels after the georgian information crises he was kidnapped by a group of peruvian revolutionaries under hugo lacerda and was tortured for information of the masse kernels ironically it was displace international who hired lacerda the same company protecting him he died from his torture before sam fisher could rescue him thomas the turtle standish thomas standish is a british specialist bank thief with expertise in cracking high security bank vault systems he was eventually caught and sent to prison but is released on the condition of assisting third echelon over a breaking into a bank in panama kaneda shetland s i sdf contact in the bathhouse kaneda meets with shetland in order to purchase the weaponized algorithms he gets into a heated argument with shetland during the meeting believing that he is being doublecrossed and orders his i sdf bodyguard to kill shetland however shetland shoots kaneda s bodyguard first and then over pleas for mercy shoots kaneda in the head killing him instantly splinter cell chaos theory co op agent one and agent two agent one and agent two were splinter cells in training in chaos theory until the korean conflict began they were sent together as a team to discover other deals by a panamanian banker who made deals between displace and hugo lacerda they learned that he made deals with a north korean scientist jong pom chu they are sent into wartorn seoul and capture jong they discover that jong had been developing a chemical weapon and are sent to a silo in north korea to locate a strain of the virus and create a vaccine the korean conflict was over by then but they learned that north korean colonel kim had refused to lay down arms and led a rogue faction of the army to plant bombs within new york the two agents head to the train station and disable the bomb they head back to north korean soil to learn that kim had the ability to strike a final time at the un headquarters the duo team return to new york at the un hq where they kill kim and disable the last bomb they return in double agent in the xbox ps2 and gamecube versions to finish the mission that sam fisher began in iceland they destroy the factory and are then sent to ellsworth penitentiary to begin a riot to allow fisher to escape the prison they are then sent to kinshasa to find weapons that the rebels had bought and destroy the bunker afterward they head to the tanker stolen by fisher disarming various bombs they are also featured in the machinima series splinter cell co op theater referred to as bob and steve senor segundo ruiz de moquiros the president for the panama administration building he had dealings with hugo lacerda and jeong pom chu the agents interrogate him for information on security systems and codes however they are ordered by lambert to not kill him under any circumstances colonel kim colonel kim is an officer in the north korean army he is the main antagonist of the co op storyline of chaos theory he refused to lay down arms against the americans and led a rogue faction of deserters to continue to wage war with america he planted chemical bombs developed by jong pom chu in new york at the train station and at the un headquarters the splinter cell duo team disabled his bombs and killed kim at the un headquarters chu a comrade of colonel kim who is in charge of the new york penn station takeover a splinter cell agent killed chu by breaking his back with his knee after interrogating him jong pom chu jong pom chu is a scientist for the north koreans he developed a deadly virus to attack the americans the splinter cell duo team abducted him and the nsa interrogated him to learn he gave the virus to colonel kim splinter cell double agent massoud ibn yussiff an ally of emile dufraisne and alejandro tawfir who is plotting to blow up mexico city with a chemical weapon a news broadcast at the end of the game states he was arrested by fbi agents allejandro tawkfir an ally of emile dufraisne and massoud ibn yussiff who is planning to blow up los angeles with a chemical weapon it is assumed he was arrested at the end of the game since a news broadcast states that everyone who was involved with the plot had been secured doctor abdul ahmad aswat a pakistani nuclear scientist who meets emile and massoud to sell nuclear documents and red mercury emile orders sam to steal the documents on how to make red mercury when emile refuses to pay aswat because the price is too high sam steals the documents and killing aswat becomes a primary objective given to sam fisher by agent hisham an undercover cia agent hisham refers to doctor aswat as a liability if sam does not succeed in killing aswat he will lose nsa trust barnham an inmate in ellsworth penitentiary who is a bully to jamie washington but an important witness to the department of justice sam has the choice to either knock him out or kill him if sam kills him he gains jamie trust even more if sam spares barnham jamie won t be too happy in the xbox 360 and pc versions he s a nameless inmate that jamie fights and knocks out in order to start a riot assistant director williams a relative newcomer to the nsa williams is the first occupant of a newly created executive position overseeing third echelon activities williams is an ambitious and skilled political player exactly the kind of person sam can t get along with he only appears in the ps2 xbox and gamecube versions but he is mentioned by hisham hamza in the xbox 360 and pc versions personality wise he s the guy that goes by the book he thinks that noc and double agent practices are too dangerous for the nsa and government williams thinks more politically than logically he knows that sam fisher is capable of doing his job but does not trust fisher under his circumstances when williams finds out about the jba mission in the other versions he is quick to pull the plug and end it fisher is forced to make careful decisions to keep the trust of williams while also making sure that the jba trust him you ll be riding on a tough moral slate the jba has to trust you but so does assistant director williams if the jba thinks your a traitor or williams thinks your playing too risky it s over either way lambert in the current generation versions it is hinted at by several e mails and his actions during the second jba hq mission the possible death of lambert and snowbound rooftop mission death of enrica that he may be the mole within the nsa emile dufraisne emile dufraisne is the main antagonist of splinter cell double agent he is the founder and leader of the jba john brown s army an american terrorist organization an imposing figure with a shaved head and a southern drawl emile has always believed he was destined for greatness in his teens he orchestrated the brutal murder of a local police man and was surrounded by suspicious deaths during his term in juvenile detention he despises the united states government believing it to be corrupt and feels the only way to achieve social change is through radical revolution for a long time he s been dreaming of more ambitious plans for the jba an organization that has frequently been suspected of but never tied to any criminal activity ultimately emile is willing to sacrifice both his operatives and himself for his insane ideals as is shown near the end of the game when he sets the red mercury bomb to blow up most of new york city and all of the jba with it in the ps2 xbox gamecube version of double agent sam confronts emile in a climactic one on one shootout within a maze of laser mines atop a new york city skyscraper during the level new york sam eventually kills emile then disarms the red mercury bomb saving new york city in the xbox 360 and pc version of double agent emile is simply one of several terrorists guarding the red mercury bomb at the center of the jba headquarters underneath new york city the player can simply sneak up on him and shoot him to death like any other enemy character the player can also interrogate emile after corner grabbing him emile will tell sam to give it up and he also tells him that killing him would only mean that sam would meet him in hell sam then killed emile by breaking his neck if you grab him the other way he fights back but sam kills him with a fictional martial arts move that pushes his nose into his brain in other versions simply tossing a flash bang into his sight will stun him allowing him to be grabbed emile will say well played fisher well played emile will continue to talk but his talking runs awfully long usually getting close to the timer of the bomb assuming emile decided to arm it hisham hamza part of a new initiative within the department of defense hisham s capacity for quick learning made him an excellent candidate to act as a field liaison between cia and the nsa following the cia s orders hisham managed to get recruited in the massoud group and is acting now as a double agent he s ready to do whatever it takes to stop the menacing plans of the jba even sacrificing himself for the right cause eventually emile will order sam to kill hisham when he discovers that he is a mole whether sam kills him or helps him escape by freeing him from the palace and blowing the whole place up to make it look like he is dead is up to the player in the current gen consoles hisham is sam s partner during the iceland mission he discovers traces of radiation in the labs and evacuates with sam when lambert calls the mission off he then joins massoud s group as a double agent until he is discovered during the kinshasa mission the player can either kill hisham and stuff his body in a car for j b a trust or escort hisham to a parking lot and hoist him over the fence facilitating his escape carson moss carson moss was summarily dismissed from pmc displace international in 1999 when he severed the ring finger on every man woman and child in a small kazakhstani village in order to demonstrate the consequences of harboring kidnappers in 2003 he enlisted in jba as head of security a hotheaded man carson is disliked by many of the members of john brown s army but no one dares challenge or question him save jamie washington he bullies everyone in the group except emile for obvious reasons and enrica probably because of her status as the only female in the jba it is also noted that he played high school football and badly hurt his knee to this day he isn t as agile as he once was in the end of the game moss is killed by sam either on the coast guard boat carrying a bomb in the xbox 360 and pc versions or in the darkened offices level in all the other versions in the xbox 360 and pc version you can try to grab moss but he will then unloosen himself after which sam knees him in the testicles and then breaks his neck enrica villablanca a brilliant young woman with a phd in biochemistry she works with emile dufraisne for the jba she seems to be the most medically trained of the jba as she can be seen working in the infirmary it would seem however that she is working for him against her will due to threats from emile exposing her to the police about her involvement in a monkey wrenching protest where a security guard was accidentally killed she is a possible love interest for sam fisher they can have an encounter in her quarters after sam cracks emile s safe she tries to cover up her insecurities with a wall of overall competence and disdain for some of her less skilled colleagues she is sam s contact in some of his missions including when he must place a bomb on a cruise ship to test it s effectiveness it is also noted that she seems to be one of the few jba members that fisher has any sort of personal connection with in the xbox ps2 and gamecube versions she is killed by an splinter cell agent sent by williams sam then kills the agent in the xbox 360 and pc version sam seduces enrica in order to cover up his being in restricted areas if sam prevents the bomb from exploding emile will kill her for her failure but if he lets it explode she will help sam later on near the end of the game by giving him his sc 20k and goggles if he forgot to collect them from the firing range and by opening a retinal scanner locked door she isn t seen or mentioned after that jamie washington jamie is a study in contrasts on one hand he s generally cheerful and easy going and once he decides he likes somebody they re friends for life on the other hand he can be vicious and cruel causing harm to anyone who gets in his way he is an active member of the jba if a jba member is interrogated in the xbox ps2 and gamecube versions he will reveal that jamie was arrested and convicted for a bogus kidnapping charge if they knew what he really did jamie would be sent straight to the chair jamie has a heart condition as found out by reading some e mails at the jba jamie is equipped with a pacemaker keeping his heart steady sam helps him break out of jail so he can get invited into john brown s army jamie and moss seem to not get along very well as fisher sees when he is snooping around in the end fisher will eventually either kill jamie instead of lambert in the xbox 360 and pc version or kill him later on in all the other versions sam kills jamie on the snowbound rooftops level in the rooftop level fisher can use his ocp to short out jamie s pace maker stopping jamie s heart and killing him stanley dayton dayton is a jba computer hacker and head of the security systems he also creates the hacking program for enrica to use on the cozumel cruise ship he despises nearly every member of the

 id=947310 title united states department of energy national laboratories nonfiltered 898 processed 887 dbindex 1560910 the united states department of energy national laboratories and technology centers are a system of facilities and laboratories overseen by the united states department of energy doe for the purpose of advancing science and helping promote the economic and defensive national interests of the united states of america most of the doe national laboratories are actually federally funded research and development centers administered managed operated and staffed by private corporations and academic universities under contract to doe history the system of centralized national laboratories grew out of the massive scientific endeavors of world war ii in which new technologies such as radar the computer the proximity fuze and the atomic bomb proved decisive for the allied victory though the united states government had begun seriously investing in scientific research for national security since world war i it was only in late 1930s and 1940s that monumental amounts of resources were committed or coordinated to wartime scientific problems under the auspices first of the national defense research committee and later the office of scientific research and development organized and administered by the mit engineer vannevar bush during the second world war centralized sites such as the radiation laboratory at mit and ernest o lawrence s laboratory at the university of california berkeley allowed for a large number of expert scientists to collaborate towards defined goals as never before and with virtually unlimited government resources at their disposal in the course of the war the allied nuclear effort the manhattan project created several secret sites for the purpose of bomb research and material development including a laboratory in the desert of new mexico directed by robert oppenheimer los alamos and sites at hanford washington and oak ridge tennessee hanford and oak ridge were administered by private companies and los alamos was administered by a public university the university of california additional success was had at the university of chicago in reactor research leading to the creation of argonne national laboratory outside chicago and at other academic institutions spread across the country after the war and its scientific successes the newly created atomic energy commission took over the future of the wartime laboratories extending their lives indefinitely they were originally thought of as temporary creations funding and infrastructure were secured to sponsor other national laboratories for both classified and basic research especially in physics each national laboratory would generally be centered around one or many expensive machines such as particle accelerators or nuclear reactors most national laboratories maintained staffs of local researchers as well as allowing for visiting researchers to use their equipment though priority to local or visiting researchers often varied from lab to lab with their centralization of resources both monetary and intellectual the national labs serve as an exemplar for big science elements of both competition and cooperation were encouraged in the laboratories often two laboratories with similar missions were created such as lawrence livermore which was designed to compete with los alamos with the hope that competition over funding would create a culture of high quality work laboratories which did not have overlapping missions would cooperate with each other for example lawrence livermore would cooperate with the lawrence berkeley laboratory which itself was often in competition with brookhaven national laboratory the national laboratory system administered first by the atomic energy commission then the energy research and development administration and currently the department of energy is one of the largest if not the largest scientific research systems in the world the doe provides more than 40 of the total national funding for physics chemistry materials science and other areas of the physical sciences many are locally managed by private companies while other are managed by academic universities and as a system they form one of the overarching and far reaching components in what is known as the iron

see sabc disambiguation the south african broadcasting corporation sabc is the state owned broadcaster in south africa and provides 18 radio stations am fm as well as 4 television broadcasts to the general public company history early years the sabc was established in 1936 through an act of parliament and replaced the previous state controlled african broadcasting corporation which was dissolved in the same year it was considered a monopoly for many years and was controlled by the white minority national party government this lead to the accusation of it being biased towards the then ruling apartheid regime at one time most of its senior management were members of the broederbond the afrikaner secret society and later drawn from institutions like stellenbosch university it was also known in afrikaans as suid afrikaanse uitsaaikorporasie sauk although this title is no longer used by the corporation until 1979 the sabc also operated broadcasting services in namibia which was then under south african rule but in that year these were transferred to the south west african broadcasting corporation swabc this in turn became the namibian broadcasting corporation nbc after the country s independence in 1990 recent history in 1996 the sabc and its services were restructured to better serve and reflect the fresh democratic society of post 1994 south africa it has since been accused of favouring the ruling anc political party mostly in the area of news broadcasting however it remains the dominant player in the country s broadcast media criticism towards the public broadcaster intensified around 2003 2005 when it was accused of a wide range of shortcomings including self censorship lack of objectivity and selective news coverage radio establishment the sabc was established by an act of parliament in 1936 taking over from the african broadcasting company which had been responsible for some of the first radio broadcasts in south africa in the 1920s the sabc established services in what were then the country s official languages english and afrikaans with broadcasts in ethnic languages such as zulu xhosa sesotho and tswana following later the sabc s first commercial service started in 1950 was known as springbok radio broadcasting in english and afrikaans regional fm music stations were started in the 1960s the sabc s choice of popular music reflected the national party government s initial conservatism with the music of the beatles and the rolling stones generally frowned upon if not banned from the airwaves in favour of middle of the road music like that of the u s group bread in 1966 the sabc also established an external service known as radio rsa which broadcast in english swahili french portuguese dutch and german it is now known as channel africa 1996 restructuring in 1996 the sabc carried out a significant restructuring of their services the main english language radio service became safm with many black presenters to the chagrin of many white listeners accustomed to proper english the new service after some initial faltering soon developed a respectable listenership and was regarded as a flagship for the new democracy however government interference in the state broadcaster in 2003 saw further changes to safm which reversed the growth and put it in rapid decline once more today it attracts only 0 6 of the total population to its broadcasts the main afrikaans radio service was renamed radio sonder grense literally radio without frontiers in 1995 and has enjoyed greater success with the transition similarly sabc radio s competitors have achieved great levels of popular appeal primedia owned radio 702 cape talk and 94 7 highveld stereo have grown steadily in audience and revenue through shrewd management since the freeing of the airwaves in south africa other stations such as the black owned and focused yfm and kaya fm have also shone attracting audiences drawn from the black majority station list safm in

controversy over the introduction of television the sabc was finally allowed to introduce a colour tv service which began experimental broadcasts in the main cities on 5 may1975 before the service went nationwide on january 6 1976 initially the tv service was funded entirely through a licence fee as in the uk but advertising began in 1978 the sabc both television and radio is still partly funded by the licence fee currently r225 per annum the service initially broadcast only in english and afrikaans with an emphasis on religious programming on sundays a local soap opera the villagers set on a gold mine was well received while other local productions like the dingleys were panned as amateurish owing to south africa s apartheid policies the british actors union equity started a boycott of programme sales to south africa meaning that the majority of acquired programming in the early years of the corporation came from the united states however the thames television police drama series the sweeney was briefly shown on sabc tv dubbed in afrikaans as blitspatrollie later on when other programmes were dubbed the original soundtrack was simulcast on fm radio with a limited budget early programming aimed at children tended to be quite innovative and programmes such as the afrikaans language puppetshows haas das se nuus kas and oscar in asblikfontein are still fondly remembered by many in 1982 a second channel was introduced broadcasting in african languages the main channel then called tv1 was divided evenly between english and afrikaans as before subtitling on tv in south africa used to be almost non existent although now many non english language soap operas have started to display english subtitles the second channel known either as tv2 tv3 or tv4 depending on the time of day was later rebranded as ccv contemporary community values a third channel was introduced known as tss or topsport surplus topsport being the brand name for the sabc s sport

corporation in namibia to establish a television service in 1981 with most programming being videotapes flown in from south africa this became part of the namibian broadcasting corporation in 1990 recent history 1996 present in 1996 almost two years after the anc came to power the sabc reorganised its three tv channels so as to be more representative of different language groups these new channels were called sabc 1 sabc 2 and sabc 3 this resulted in the downgrading of afrikaans which now had its airtime reduced a move that angered many whites the sabc also later absorbed the bop tv station of the former bophuthatswana bantustan other news broadcasts the sabc carried cnn international news broadcasts from 1990 but discontinued them around the time of the 2003 invasion of iraq it used to but no longer carries bbc world news programming in the early hours of the morning instead it now carries sport south african viewers who can afford it and want to view international news unfiltered by sabc news have to subscribe to dstv which broadcasts amongst others cnn international bbc world and sky news new services in recent years the sabc began broadcasting two tv channels to the rest of the continent sabc africa a news service and africa 2 africa entertainment programming from south africa and other african countries in 1999 these were carried for free by dstv in 2003 africa 2 africa was merged with sabc africa sabc africa s news bulletins are also carried on the original black entertainment obe satellite television channel in the uk in south africa itself the sabc has announced the launch of two regional television channels sabc4 and sabc5 with an emphasis on languages other than english sabc4 will broadcast in tswana sesotho pedi tsonga venda and afrikaans as well as english to the northern provinces of the country in the southern provinces sabc5 will broadcast in xhosa zulu ndebele and swazi as well as afrikaans and english unlike other sabc tv services sabc4 and sabc5 will not be available via satellite competition in 1986 the sabc s monopoly on tv was challenged by the launch of a subscription based service known as m net backed by a consortium of newspaper publishers however it could not broadcast its own news and current affairs programmes which were still the preserve of the sabc the sabc s dominance was further eroded by the launch of the first free to air private tv channel called e tv satellite television also expanded as m net s parent company multichoice launched its digital satellite tv service dstv in 1995 most of the sabc s tv channels are still provided as part of this service station list 1976 to 1995 tv1 tv2 tv3 tv4 topsport nntv 1996 onward sabc1 mixed south african languages sabc2 mixed south african languages including afrikaans sabc3 english sabc africa sabc4 under development sabc5 under development criticism a throwback to the apartheid days many people believe the sabc to be the mouthpiece of government as the previous ruling party often used the sabc as platform to broadcast propaganda to the nation despite a change in government this public perception was reinforced when in august 2005 the sabc came under heavy fire from non affiliated media and the public for failing to broadcast a scene whereby deputy president phumzile mlambo ngcuka was booed offstage by members of the anc youth league who were showing support for the newly axed ex deputy president jacob zuma rival broadcaster etv publicly accused sabc of biased reporting by failing to show the video footage of the humiliated deputy president but snuki zikalala head of news and ex anc spokesperson retorted by stating that their cameraman was not present at the meeting a fact later falsified by released etv footage showing the sabc cameraman filming the incident sabc s government connections also came under scrutiny when in april 2005 zimbabwean president robert mugabe was interviewed live by zikalala who is a former anc political commissar the interview held was deemed by the public eye to have side stepped critical issues and controversial questions regarding mugabe s radical land reform policies and human rights violations in may 2006 the sabc was accused of self censorship when it decided not to air a documentary on south african president thabo mbeki and in early june requested that the producers from daylight films not speak about it this has been widely criticised by independent media groups in response the international freedom of expression exchange issued an alert concerning the sabc s apparent trend toward self censorship in june 2006 the international federation of journalists denounced the cancelling of the thabo mbeki documentary citing self censorship and politically influenced managers also in june 2006 safm host john perlman disclosed on air that the sabc had created a blacklist of commentators a commission of inquiry was created by sabc ceo dali mpofu into the allegations that individuals were blacklisted at the behest of zikalala see also television in south africa list of south african television series external links official site iol sabc battles the image of being

the independent wing of the evangelical protestant movement for more than two decades he resigned from his pastoral role in 1999 when he refused to end the relationship he was having with his male research assistant he is now an occasional speaker in gay evangelical circles his theology could be said to be based on the primacy of personal feelings and postmodern relativism thus for clements the biblical prohibitions on the practice of homosexuality should be ignored because they a undermine incontrovertibly positive aspects of same sex relationships and b belong to a sexually naive and unilluminated period of sacred history truth according to clements cannot be divine if it calls into question one s sexual orientation as the latter is simply a given however clements does not address the issue of how other sexual experiences or preferences e g polygamy extra marital affairs multiple partners the use of male or female prostitutes and paedophilia etc can be evaluated biblically if a person s sexual inclination tastes or orientation are ontologically constitutive nor does he explain why biblical notions of sin atonement salvation hell judgement etc should still inform contemporary christian thinking given the bible s unreliable views on homosexuality biography roy clements grew up in the east end of london and earned a ph d in chemical physics before working for uccf university colleges christian fellowship in nairobi and serving as pastor of nairobi baptist church in kenya he returned to the uk in 1979 when he became pastor of eden baptist church cambridge where he developed a highly significant ministry to students over a period of some 20 years he gained a reputation within the international christian movement as an accomplished preacher and teacher he was in great demand as a conference speaker and served on the boards of a number of leading evangelical organisations including the management council of evangelical alliance which represents more than a million christians across 30 denominations being outed at the time of his outing or of his being found out in 1999 he was married with three children in march 1999 he resigned as senior pastor of eden baptist church in cambridge three months later he told his wife jane about his homosexual orientation she repeatedly requested that he end the relationship with the man he was seeing clements refused he explained he was planning a two year study leave to permit reflection on his sexuality his wife suggested that he correspond with dr john stott rector emeritus of all souls church langham place in london a distinguished evangelical leader and a close personal friend of clements s stott urged him to resist any idea that homosexuality may be embraced as a christian option in early september 1999 his wife and a group of christian leaders at eden baptist including sir fred catherwood decided in clements s words that the possibility of coming out at some point in the future posed an unacceptable risk of scandal as a damage limitation exercise a press release was therefore issued by the evangelical alliance in the uk informing the secular media that was gay as a consequence a half page article and large photograph appeared in the london times newspaper clements however was highly praised in the evangelical alliance press release for his integrity in resigning from his post the christian community was enjoined to give him and his family time and space to reflect on their situation and future roy eventually left his wife and moved in with his male partner thus ending his ministry in evangelical pulpits however several of his former close evangelical friends and associates have attempted to maintain contact with him but do not know his whereabouts as clements has since adopted a policy of secrecy about his private life roy now alligns himself with homosexual christian advocacy groups including evangelicals concerned and the evangelical fellowship of lesbian and gay christians

himself the new messiah and younger brother of jesus christ yang xiuqing was a former salesman of firewood in guangxi who was frequently able to act as a mouthpiece of god to direct the people and gain himself a large amount of political power hong yang and their followers established the taiping heavenly kingdom officially heavenly kingdom of great peace and attained control of significant parts of southern china most accurate sources put the total deaths during the 15 years of the rebellion at about 20 million civilians and army personnel although some claim the death toll was much higher as many as 50 million according to at least one source some historians estimate the combination of natural disasters together with the political insurrections may have cost as many as 200 million chinese lives between 1850 and 1865 that figure is generally thought to be an exaggeration as it is approximately half the estimated population of china in 1851 nevertheless the taiping rebellion stands as the second bloodiest conflict in history greater than world war i and behind only world war ii it happened at roughly the same time as the american civil war and yet it was much more destructive artifacts from the taiping period can be seen at the taiping kingdom history museum in nanjing china beginning in the mid 19th century china suffered a series of natural disasters economic problems and defeats at the hands of the western powers e g the qing dynasty lost their war against great britain in the first opium war the ruling qing dynasty ethnically manchu was seen by the chinese majority ethnically han as ineffective and corrupt anti manchu sentiment was strongest in the south among the laboring classes and it was these disaffected that flocked to the charismatic visionary hong xiuquan a member of the hakka minority the sect s militarism grew in the 1840s initially in response to its struggle to suppress bandits but persecution by qing authorities spurred the movement into a guerilla rebellion and then into full blown civil war the revolt began in guangxi province in early january 1851 a ten thousand strong rebel army organised by feng yunshan and wei changhui routed imperial troops stationed at the town of jintian in what s now called the jintian uprising heavenly kingdom forces successfully drove back the imperial reprisal and in august 1851 hong declared the establishment of the heavenly kingdom of peace taiping tianguo with himself as absolute ruler the revolt rapidly spread northward in march 1853 between 700 000 and 800 000 taiping soldiers took nanjing killing 30 000 imperial soldiers and slaughtering thousands of civilians the city became the movement s capital and was renamed tianjing heavenly capital army of love the rebellion s army was its key strength it was marked by a high level of discipline and fanaticism they typically wore a uniform of red jackets with blue trousers and grew their hair long in chinese they were known as chángmáo meaning long hair the large numbers of women serving in the taiping heavenly army also distinguished it from 19th century armies combat was always bloody and extremely brutal with little artillery but huge forces equipped with small arms by 1856 the taiping armies numbered just over 1 million their main strategy of conquest was to take major cities consolidate their hold on the cities then march out into the surrounding countryside to battle imperial forces although most modern estimates never put the taiping heavenly army as numbering much more than a million in total contemporary estimates placed its numbers far higher indeed it was said that the main taiping armies in central china in 1860 numbered 2 5 million if this figure were accepted as accurate which it most likely is not it would imply a total of 3 million soldiers or more the organization of a taiping army corps was thus 1 general 5 colonels 25 captains 125 lieutenants 500 sergeants 2 500 corporals 10 000 privates 13 156 men in total these corps were placed into armies of varying sizes in addition to the main taiping forces organised along the above lines there were also many tens of thousands and possibly hundreds of thousands of pro taiping groups that fielded their own forces of irregulars ethnically the taiping heavenly army was formed at the outset largely from two groups the hakka a hàn chinese sub group pinyin kèji literally guest families or guest households and the zhuàng a non han ethnic group both of which were minority peoples as compared to the hàn chinese sub groups that form dominant regional majorities across south china it is no coincidence that hóng xiùquán and the other taiping royals were hakka as a hàn sub group the hakka were frequently marginalized economically and politically having migrated to the regions they inhabit only after other hàn groups were already established there for example when the hakka settled in gu ngd ng and parts of gu ngx speakers of cantonese were already the dominant regional hàn group there and had been for some time just as speakers of various dialects of mín are locally dominant in fújiàn province the hakka settled throughout south china and beyond but as latecomers they generally had to establish their communities on rugged less fertile land scattered on the fringe of the local majority group s settlements as their name guest households suggests the hakka were generally treated as migrant newcomers often subject to hostility and derision from local majority hàn populations consequently the hakka to a greater extent than other hàn chinese have been historically associated with popular unrest and rebellion the other significant ethnic group in the taiping army were the zhuàng simplified chinese pinyin zhuàngzú an indigenous people of tai origin and china s largest non han ethnic minority group over the centuries zhuàng communities had been adopting hàn chinese culture this was possible because given the linguistic complexity of south china where many of the dialects of han chinese are not mutually intelligible hàn culture in the region accommodates a great deal of linguistic diversity so the zhuàng could be absorbed as if the zhuàng language were just another hàn chinese dialect which it is not as zhuàng communities were integrating with the hàn at different rates a certain amount of friction between hàn and zhuàng was inevitable with zhuàng unrest on occasion leading to armed uprisings the second tier of the taiping army was an ethnic mix that included many zhuàng prominent at this level was shí dák i who was half hakka half zhuàng and spoke both languages fluently making him quite a rare asset to the taiping leadership in the later stages of the taiping rebellion the number of hàn chinese in the army from hàn groups other than the hakka increased substantially however the hakka and the zhuàng who constituted as much as 25 of the taiping army as well as other non hàn ethnic minority groups many of them of tai origin related to the zhuàng continued to feature prominently in the rebellion throughout its duration with virtually no leaders emerging from any hàn chinese group other than the hakka socially and economically the taipings came almost exclusively from the lowest classes many of the southern taiping troops were former miners especially those coming from the zhuang very few taipings even in the leadership caste came from the imperial bureaucracy almost none were landlords and in occupied territories landlords were often executed in this sense the taiping army was a prototype for the people s liberation army of the twentieth century opposing these forces was an imperial army of more than 2 million possibly as large as 5 million with something on the order of hundreds of thousands of regional militias and foreign mercenaries operating in support among the imperial forces was the elite ever victorious army consisting of chinese soldiers led by a european officer corps see frederick townsend ward and charles gordon a particularly famous imperial force was the xiang army of zeng guofan from the above it is obvious that establishing reasonable figures for the sizes of the opposing armies is very difficult although keeping accurate records was something imperial china traditionally did very well the decentralised nature of the imperial war effort relying on regional forces and the fact that the war was a civil war and therefore very chaotic meant that reliable figures are impossible to find the destruction of the heavenly kingdom also meant that any records it possessed were destroyed though almost certainly the largest civil war of the nineteenth century in terms of numbers under arms it is debatable whether the taiping rebellion involved more soldiers than the napoleonic wars earlier in the century and so it is uncertain whether it was the largest war of the nineteenth century at the third battle of nanking in 1864 more than 100 000 were killed in three days theology although ostensibly christian the heavenly kingdom of great peace has long been considered heretical by major branches of christianity the movement s founder hong xiuquan had tried and failed to earn his shengyuan civil service degree numerous times after one such failure hong had overheard a chinese protestant missionary preaching and taken home some bible tracts including a pamphlet titled good words for exhorting the age then in 1843 after his final failure he had what some regard as a nervous breakdown and others as a mystical revelation connecting his in depth readings of the christian tracts to strange dreams he had been having for the past six years in his dreams a bearded man with golden hair gave him a sword and with a younger man hong addressed as elder brother taught him how to slay evil spirits spence 1999 172 based on his readings hong xiuquan came to believe that the figures in his dreams were god the father and jesus christ and that they were revealing his destiny as a slayer of demons and the leader of a new heavenly kingdom on earth hong developed a literalist understanding of the bible which soon gave rise to a unique theology he rejected the doctrine of the trinity only the father was truly god jesus christ was the father s firstborn son with hong xiuquan himself being the father s second son and the younger brother of jesus it was said that when foreign missionaries later explained to hong xiuquan that jesus was the father s only son he simply crossed out the word only the holy spirit for hong was nothing more than a holy wind a belief based on the poor translation skills of christian missionaries in fact yang xiuqing later took the title holy wind the comforter as he had become the taiping leader who had most of the political power during the rebellion and was keen to gain titles yang xiuqings religious motivations are disputed based on his readings and personal revelations hong xiuquan added a third group of books in addition to the old testament and the new testament to the taiping regime s bible the kingdom s policies within the land that they controlled the taiping heavenly army established a theocratic and highly militarised rule the subject of study for the examinations for officials formerly civil service exams changed from the confucian classics to the christian bible private property ownership was abolished and all land was held and distributed by the state a solar calendar replaced the lunar calendar the society was declared classless and the sexes were declared equal it was the first chinese regime ever to admit women into examinations foot binding was banned monogamy was promoted other new laws were promulgated including the prohibition of opium gambling tobacco alcohol polygamy including concubinage slavery and prostitution however the rule was remarkably ineffective haphazard and brutal all efforts were concentrated on the army and civil administration was very poor rule was established in the major cities but the land outside the urban areas was little regarded even though polygamy was banned it was believed that hong xiuquan had 88 concubines many high ranking taiping officials kept concubines as a matter of prerogative and lived as de facto kings in its first year the heavenly kingdom minted coins that were 23 mm to 26 mm and around 4 1 g the inscription the heavenly kingdom of great peace was on the front where kingdom was written in a non standard form of the character instead of and holy treasure on the back administration ranked below the king of heaven hong xiuquan the territory was divided among provincial rulers called kings or princes initially there were five the kings of the four quarters and the king of the yi meaning flanks of the original rulers the west king and south king were killed in combat in 1852 the east king was murdered by the north king during a coup d etat in 1856 and the north king himself was subsequently killed the kings names were south king feng yunshan 1852 east king yang xiuqing 1856 west king xiao chaogui 1852 north king wei changhui 1856 yi king shi dakai captured and executed by qing imperials in 1863 the later leaders of the movement were princes zhong prince li xiucheng 1823 1864 captured and executed by qing imperials ying prince

gui tien kuei 1864 executed other princes include an prince hong renfa hong xiuquan s eldest brother yong prince hong rengui fu prince hong renfu climax at its height the heavenly kingdom encompassed much of south and central china centered on the fertile yangtze river valley control of the river meant that the taipings could easily supply their capital at nanjing which they renamed tianjing from there the taipings continued their assault two armies were sent west to secure the upper reaches of the yangtze two more armies were sent north to take the imperial capital beijing potentially these two expeditions could have acted as a giant pincer movement across the country the western expedition met with some mixed success but the attempt to take beijing failed after being repulsed at the outskirts of tianjin downfall in 1853 hong withdrew from active control of policies and administration his sanity progressively eroding he devoted himself to meditation and more sensual pursuits including his private harem with their leader largely out of the picture taiping delegates tried to widen their popular support with the chinese middle classes and to forge alliances with european powers but failed on both counts inside china the rebellion faced resistance from the traditionalist middle class because of their hostility to many long standing chinese customs and confucian values the land owning upper class unsettled by the taipings peasant mannerisms and their policy of strict separation of the sexes even for married couples sided with the imperial forces and their western allies following a setback near beijing they continued to expand westward but spent most of their efforts maintaining their hold in the yangtze valley from 1860 the kingdom s fall was rapid an attempt to take shanghai in august 1860 was repulsed by troops under the command of frederick townsend ward a force that would later become the ever victorious army led by chinese gordon imperial forces reorganized under the command of zeng guofan and li hongzhang and the imperial reconquest began in earnest by early 1864 imperial control in most areas was well established hong declared that god would defend tianjing but in june with imperial forces approaching he died of food poisoning as the result of ingesting wild vegetables as the city begin to run out of food his body was buried in the former ming imperial palace where it was later exumed by the conquering zheng to verify his death then cremated hong s ashes were later blasted out of a cannon so it has no resting place as eternal punishment for the uprising four months before the fall of the heavenly kingdom of taiping hong xiuquan passed the throne to hong tianguifu his eldest son however hong tianguifu was unable to do anything to restore the kingdom so the kingdom was quickly destroyed when nanjing fell to the imperial armies after vicious street by street fighting most of the princes were executed by qing

 id=2811055 title nouméa accord nonfiltered 964 processed 951 dbindex 1560978 the noumea accord of 1998 promises political power to the kanaks until full independence is achieved in 2013 or 2018 france will continue to control military and foreign affairs immigration police and currency until that time informal english translation of the french text of the accord note this is an informal translation and has no official standing agreement on new caledonia preamble 1 on 24 september 1853 when france claimed grande terre which james cook had named new caledonia it took possession of a territory in accordance with the conditions of international law as recognised at that time by the nations of europe and america it did not establish legally formalised relations with the indigenous population the treaties entered into with the customary authorities in 1854 and subsequent years did not represent balanced agreements but were in fact unilateral instruments this territory was not empty grande terre and the outlying islands were inhabited by men and women now known as kanaks they had developed their own civilisation with its traditions and languages in which custom which governed social and political life prevailed their cultural and spiritual life was expressed through various forms of creativity the kanak identity was based on a particular relationship with land each individual and each clan defined itself in terms of a specific link to a valley a hill the sea or a river estuary and carried in its memory the acceptance of other families on its land the names attached by tradition to each element of the landscape and the tabus affecting some of these as well as the customary ways gave structure to space and exchanges 2 the colonisation of new caledonia occurred as part of a broad historical movement which saw the european countries impose their domination on the rest of the world in the 19th and 20th centuries many men and women came either with the conviction that they were bringing progress or inspired by their religious faith or sent against their will or seeking a second chance in new caledonia they settled and started families there they brought with them their ideals knowledge hopes ambitions illusions and contradictions some of them especially the cultured people priests and pastors doctors and engineers administrators soldiers and political leaders looked differently upon the original inhabitants showing greater understanding and genuine compassion through their scientific and technical knowledge the territory s new communities participated in mining and agricultural activity often under difficult circumstances and with the help of the state in the shaping of new caledonia their determination and inventiveness made it possible to use resources and lay a foundation for development the relationship of new caledonia with the distant motherland long remained marked by colonial dependency a one sided relationship and a refusal to recognise specific characteristics from which the new communities in their aspirations also suffered 3 the time has come to recognise the shadows of the colonial period even if it was not devoid of light the impact of colonisation had a long lasting traumatic effect on the original people some clans lost their names when they lost their land large scale land colonisation caused considerable population movements in which the kanak clans saw their subsistence resources depleted and their places of memory lost this process of dispossession engendered a loss of identity markers kanak social organisation even if its principles were recognised was thus thrown into upheaval population movements damaged its fabric while ignorance or power strategies all too often led to the negation of the legitimate authorities and the installation of leaders considered under custom to have no legitimacy which aggravated the identity trauma at the same time the kanak artistic heritage was considered non existent or looted to this denial of the fundamental elements of the kanak identity were added restrictions on public freedoms and a lack of political rights despite the fact that the kanaks had paid a heavy toll in the defence of france especially during the first world war the kanaks were relegated to the geographical economic and political fringes of their own country which in a proud people not without warrior traditions could not but cause revolts which were violently put down aggravating resentment and misunderstanding colonisation harmed the dignity of the kanak people and deprived it of its identity in this confrontation some men and women lost their lives or their reasons for living much suffering resulted from it these difficult times need to be remembered the mistakes recognised and the kanak people s confiscated identity restored which equates in its mind with a recognition of its sovereignty prior to the forging of a new sovereignty shared in a common destiny 4 decolonisation is the way to rebuild a lasting social bond between the communities living in new caledonia today by enabling the kanak people to establish new relations with france reflecting the realities of our time thorough their participation in the construction of new caledonia the communities living in the territory have acquired a legitimacy to live there and to continue contributing to its development they are essential for its social balance and the operation of its economy and social institutions although accession of kanaks to positions of responsibility remains insufficient and needs to be increased through proactive measures it is also a fact that the participation of other communities in the life of the territory is essential it is now necessary to start making provision for a citizenship of new caledonia enabling the original people to form a human community asserting its common destiny with the other men and women living there the size of new caledonia and its economic and social balances do not make it possible to open the employment market widely and justify action to protect local employment the matignon accords signed in june 1988 demonstrated the will of the inhabitants of new caledonia to put violence and rejection behind them and tread the path of peace solidarity and prosperity together ten years on a new process needs to commence entailing the full recognition of the kanak identity as a pre requisite for rebuilding a social contract between all the communities living in new caledonia and entailing shared sovereignty with france in preparation for full sovereignty the past was the time of colonisation the present is the time of sharing through the achievement of a new balance the future must be the time of an identity in a common destiny france stands ready to accompany new caledonia on that path 5 the signatories of the matignon accords have therefore decided together to come to a negotiated agreement based on consensus which they will jointly call upon the inhabitants of new caledonia to endorse this agreement specifies the political organisation of new caledonia and the arrangements for its emancipation over a twenty year period its implementation will require a constitution bill which the government undertakes to draft for enactment by parliament the full recognition of the kanak identity requires customary law status and its links with the civil law status of persons governed by ordinary law to be defined and provision to be made for the place of customary bodies in the institutions particularly through the establishment of a customary senate it requires the kanak cultural heritage to be protected and enhanced and new legal and financial mechanisms to be introduced in response to representations based on the link with land while facilitating land development and identity symbols conveying the essential place of the kanak identity in the accepted common destiny to be adopted the institutions of new caledonia will reflect further progress towards sovereignty some congress resolutions will be deemed to be laws and an elected executive will draft and implement them during this period signs will be given of the gradual recognition of a citizenship of new caledonia which must express the chosen common destiny and be able after the end of the period to become a nationality should it be so decided the entitlement to vote in elections to new caledonia s own local assemblies will be restricted to persons with a certain period of prior residence in new caledonia in order to take into account the limited size of the employment market provision will be made to give priority access to local employment to persons residing on a long term basis in new caledonia the sharing of responsibilities between the state and new caledonia will signify shared sovereignty this will be a gradual process some powers will be transferred as soon as the new arrangements commence others will be transferred according to a set timetable which the congress will be able to modify according to the principle of self organisation the transferred powers may not revert to the state reflecting the principle of irreversibility governing these arrangements throughout the period of implementation of the new arrangements new caledonia will enjoy the support of the state in terms of technical assistance training and the funding necessary to exercise the transferred powers and for economic and social development commitments will be applied to multi annual programmes new caledonia will participate in the capital and operation of the main development institutions in which the state is a partner at the end of a period of twenty years the transfer to new caledonia of the reserved powers its achievement of full international responsibility status and the conversion of citizenship into nationality will be voted upon by the people concerned their approval would mean full sovereignty for new caledonia policy document 1 the kanak identity new caledonia s political and social organisation must take the kanak identity into account more fully 1 1 the special civil law status some kanaks have ordinary civil law status without having desired it the special civil law status is a source of legal insecurity and does not make it possible to respond appropriately to certain situations of modern life consequently the following policy has been set the special civil law status will henceforth be called customary status any person entitled to customary status who may have renounced it or been deprived of it following such renunciation by his her ancestors or through marriage or for any other reason case of children whose births were registered in metropolitan france will be able to recover it the constitutional revision act will authorise this exception under article 75 of the constitution the rules pertaining to the customary status will be laid down by the institutions of new caledonia as set out hereafter the customary status will make a distinction between property located in customary land new name for the reserves which in the case of inheritance will be transferred and allocated in accordance with the rules of custom and property located outside customary land which will be governed by the rules of ordinary law 1 2 customary law and bodies 1 2 1 the legal status of the palaver record which name may be changed must be redefined in order to give it full force of law by determining its format and setting up an appeal process that will guard against subsequent disputes the role of the syndic des affaires coutumières recorder of customary affairs at present held by the gendarmerie will be played by another agent possibly a representative of the commune or of the customary area the format of the palaver record will be defined by the congress in consultation with the customary authorities see below the roll call will take place before the area council and proceedings will be recorded by that council or the commune authorities 1 2 2 the role of the customary areas will be enhanced in particular by giving the area councils a say in clarifying and interpreting customary rules broadly speaking new caledonia s spatial organisation will need to take more account of their existence in particular the boundaries of the communes should be able to take the customary areas boundaries into consideration 1 2 3 the mode of recognition of the customary authorities will be specified in order to guarantee their legitimacy it will be defined by new caledonia s customary authorities see below it will be notified to the representative of the state and to new caledonia s executive whose role will be confined to recording it their status will be specified 1 2 4 the role of the customary authorities in the prevention of social ills and mediation in criminal sentencing will be acknowledged their role in respect of the latter will be included in the provisions of the legal instruments governing criminal procedure in new caledonia the customary authorities could be invited by the provincial assemblies or commune authorities to take part in the drafting of local assembly resolutions 1 2 5 the customary council of new caledonia will become a customary senate consisting of sixteen members two from each customary area which it will be compulsory to consult on subjects relating to kanak identity 1 3 the cultural heritage 1 3 1 place names kanak place names will be compiled and reinstated sites that are sacred in the kanak tradition will be identified and legally protected in accordance with the rules applying to historical consideration 1 3 2 cultural material the state will facilitate the return to new caledonia of kanak cultural material located in museums and collections in mainland france or other countries the legal means at the state s disposal for the protection of the national heritage will be brought into play for this purpose agreements will be drawn up with the relevant institutions for the return of these items or their utilisation in positive ways 1 3 3 languages the kanak languages together with french are languages of education and culture in new caledonia their place in school curricula and in the media should therefore be increased and extensive consideration should be given to how to achieve this scientific research and university courses on kanak languages should be organised in new caledonia the institut national des langues et civilisations orientales institute for oriental languages and civilisations will play a pivotal role in this regard for these languages to gain their rightful place in primary and secondary schooling a substantial effort will be put into training of trainers an academy of kanak languages will be set up as a local public institution whose board of governors will consist of speakers of kanak languages appointed by agreement with the customary authorities the academy will set rules for usage and development of the kanak languages 1 3 4 cultural development kanak culture must be developed and enhanced through artistic training courses and in the media copyright must be effectively protected 1 3 5 tjibaou cultural centre the state undertakes to provide on a long term basis the technical assistance and funds required for the tjibaou cultural centre to be able to fully play its part as a centre for outreach by kanak culture on all these matters pertaining to the cultural heritage the state will propose that a specific agreement be entered into with new caledonia 1 4 land every kanak s identity is defined primarily with reference to an area of land the task and operations of the agence de développement rural et d aménagement foncier a d r a f rural development and land management board will have to be thoroughly reassessed it will require sufficient resources for taking action in suburban areas measures accompanying land grants will need to be strengthened so as to facilitate the beneficiaries establishment and development of the land customary land must be surveyed and registered so that customary rights over any piece of land can be clearly identified new legal and financial instruments will be introduced to promote development on customary land whose status must not act as an obstacle to economic development land reform will be continued customary land will consist of reserve land the land assigned to groupements de droit particulier local g d p l groups governed by special local law provisions and the land that will be assigned by a d r a f in response to representations based on the link to land thus all land will henceforth be either customary land or land held under ordinary civil law lease arrangements specifying relations between the customary owner and the developer of custom land will be defined by the congress in consultation with the customary senate any disputes will be dealt with by the ordinary law courts with the assistance of customary assessors a survey of state land and land held by the territory will be undertaken with a view to assigning these land areas to other local government entities or to customary owners or private owners either in order to restore land rights or to enable developments of common interest to be carried out the issue of the maritime zone will be considered in a similar spirit 1 5 the symbols the country s identity signs name flag anthem currency design of bank notes will need to be devised in common to express both the kanak identity and the future in which all will share the constitution act on new caledonia will provide for the possibility of changing this name by means of a law of the country adopted with a qualified majority see below the country s name may be printed on identity papers as a sign of citizenship 2 the institutions one of the principles of the political agreement is the recognition of a citizenship of new caledonia this citizenship reflects the chosen common destiny and could become a nationality at the end of the agreement s period of application should it so be decided during this period the concept of citizenship justifies the restrictions applied to the electorate both for elections to the country s institutions and for the final referendum this concept will also be referred to in the drawing up of regulations aimed at protecting local employment opportunities the constitution act will authorise this 2 1 the assemblies 2 1 1 the provincial assemblies

 id=589722 title glengarry glen ross nonfiltered 971 processed 958 dbindex 1560985 this article is about the play by david mamet for the movie adaption see glengarry glen ross film glengarry glen ross is the title of a 1984 pulitzer prize and tony winning play by david mamet the play shows parts of two days in the lives of four desperate chicago real estate agents who are prepared to engage in any number of unethical and or illegal acts from lies and flattery to bribery threats and intimidation to burglary in order to sell undesirable real estate to unwilling prospective buyers the play draws partly on mamet s experiences of life in a chicago real estate office where he worked briefly as a typist in the late 1960s the title of the play comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters characters richard ricky roma the most successful salesman in the office roma thinks of himself as a latter day cowboy and regards his ability to make a sale as a sign of his virility he s ruthless dishonest and amoral but succeeds because he has a talent for figuring out a client s weaknesses and crafting a pitch that will exploit those weaknesses he s a smooth talker and often speaks in grand poetic soliloquies shelly the machine levene an older man a once successful salesman who has fallen on hard times and hasn t closed a big deal in a long time he has a sick daughter and needs money desperately which is why he s constantly whining and begging williamson for some promising sales leads james lingk a timid middle aged man who becomes roma s latest client lingk is easily manipulated and finds roma highly charismatic john williamson the office manager the salesmen despise williamson and look down on him but need him desperately because he s the one who hands out the sales leads george aaronow a sad sack an aging salesman with poor people skills and low self esteem dave moss a big mouthed salesman with big dreams and schemes moss resents williamson mitch and murray for putting such pressure on him and plans to strike back at them by stealing all their best sales leads and selling them to a competitor moss sees aaronow as a potential accomplice baylen a police detective he appears in the final act to investigate the office break in and interrogate each cast member behind closed doors mitch and murray these unseen characters are the owners of the real estate agency they have set up a cruel sales contest that has put enormous pressure on the salesmen to produce or to lose their jobs synopsis act 1 set entirely in a chinese restaurant scene 1 shelly levene has been in a major slump and hasn t made a sale in some time he s desperate for money and knows he ll lose his job soon if he can t turn things around he tries in every way imaginable to convince office manager john williamson to give him some of the glengarry leads names and phone numbers of promising potential clients for expensive properties the firm will be selling in the near future williamson adamantly refuses levene tries first to charm williamson then to threaten him and finally to bribe him williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads but demands cash in advance levene can t come up with the cash and must leave without any good leads to work with scene 2 dave moss and george aaronow are complaining about mitch and murray the big bosses they hate the pressure management has put on them to succeed moss tells aaronow that they need to strike back at mitch and murray by stealing all the glengarry leads and selling them to another real estate agency moss plan would require the hapless aaronow to break into the office stage a burglary and steal all the prime leads aaronow wants no part of the plan but moss intimidates him saying that aaronow is already an accomplice legally simply because he listened to the idea scene 3 ricky roma delivers a long disjointed but compelling monologue to a meek middle aged man named james lingk roma does not bring up the real estate he wants to sell to lingk until the very end instead roma preys upon lingk s insecurities and his sense that he s never done anything adventurous with his life when you die you ll regret the things you didn t do roma tells lingk who finds ricky spellbinding lingk sees in ricky roma all the virtues he lacks virility confidence a sense of adventure by the time roma brings out sales brochures lingk is ready to do almost anything to ingratiate himself with roma act 2 set entirely at the sales office someone has broken into the office and stolen everything that wasn t bolted down including the glengarry leads williamson has called in a police detective who interrogates each salesman behind closed doors in williamson s office george aaronow is extremely nervous and guilty looking shelly levene bursts into the office looking deliriously happy because he s finally sold a large plot of land to a couple named nyborg in his joy he hardly seems to notice that the office is in shambles a nervous james lingk enters the office looking for ricky roma lingk s wife has ordered him to cancel the sales contract he signed with roma and under illinois law he has the right to terminate that contract within 72 hours lingk asks for his check to be refunded roma tries to stall him by assuring him the contract has not been turned in and the check has not yet been cashed at this point john williamson who has completely misread the situation steps in to reassure lingk that the contract has been sent through and the check has been deposited horrified lingk leaves to seek redress from the state attorney general s office ricky roma is furious at williamson who has blown a big sale and commission for him he berates and humiliates williamson calling him a fairy and asking who told you you could work with men when roma is finished he has to leave to be interviewed by the police detective shelly levene picks up where roma left off and begins insulting williamson telling him what a stupid mistake it was to lie about turning in the contract and depositing the check williamson realizes then that shelly levene must have been the thief only the real thief could have known that he was lying because only the real thief could have known that the contract and the check were sitting on williamson s desk williamson accuses levene and threatens to tell his suspicions to the police detective levene folds and admits pathetically that he and dave moss were the thieves once again he tries to bribe williamson to forget about the crime he offers to give williamson his commission from the nyborg sale williamson laughs at this he tells levene that the nyborgs are crazy old folks who have no money and just enjoy talking to salesmen williamson has been feeding levene worthless leads like the nyborgs for months because he just doesn t like shelly when roma comes back from his interrogation williamson goes to tell the detective that moss and levene are the thieves roma who has no idea what just went on between williamson and levene proposes to shelly that they should form their own partnership shelly smiles sadly and agrees knowing that he s going to be arrested any moment the detective comes out and calls levene s name shelly meekly walks away with the detective language the play is noteworthy for the flow of persuasive patter of the salesmen characters who spend much time trying to convince customers the oily office manager and even each other to give them what they want down payments for real estate access to valuable sales leads and even co operation in conspiracies the play also shocked audiences with its for the time raw language with its roughly 150 uses of the word fuck or variations as in this early scene when desperate salesman shelley levene tries to persuade the office manager williamson to give levene prospects or leads to sell to levene i need the leads i need them now or i m gone and you re going to miss me john i swear to you williamson murray levene you talk to murray williamson i have and my job is to marshal those leads levene marshal the leads marshal the leads what the fuck what bus did you get off of we re here to fucking sell fuck marshaling the leads what the fuck talk is that what the fuck talk is that where did you learn that in school pause that s talk my friend that s talk our job is to sell i m the man to sell i m getting garbage pause you re giving it to me and what i m saying is it s fucked the play also contains an instance of the word cunt which is often thought of as an unusable word in drama radio television and film controversy there exists significant controversy over lines in the play and movie which are racist against asian indians as a result mamet removed the language from the latest broadway revival productions the world premiere of glengarry glen ross was on september 21 1983 at the cottlesloe theatre of the royal national

 id=851118 title rokugan nonfiltered 976 processed 963 dbindex 1560990 rokugan is the fictional empire which is the main power in the legend of the five rings setting the basis for the legend of the five rings collectible card game and legend of the five rings role playing game both from alderac entertainment group it is similar to feudal japan though it also includes aspects of other asian cultures as well as magic and mythical beasts the setting was used by wizards of the coast as the basis for their updated oriental adventures d20 supplement there is no given name for the entire world which the setting describes so rokugan is used alternately to refer to the specific nation within the setting or to refer to the entire world strictly speaking this is incorrect but as the emperor lays claim to all that is as a right of being the descendant of amaterasu and onnotangu lord moon and lady sun the courtiers of the emerald empire would see this as an appropriate use the citizens and rulers of the burning sands and ivory kingdoms might disagree however some say that ningen do the name of the metaphysical realm in which the world is placed serves as a proper name for the world the empire of rokugan rokugani society is based on a clan structure with seven and later eight so called great clans as well as a number of minor clans great clans are made up of several family lines each with their own general purpose within the clan minor clans on the other hand generally only have one family each clan also has areas of land bequeathed by the emperor under their control the emperor retains ownership off all lands however and the clans essentially rent the lands they use by paying taxes annually crab clan the crab clan is considered the least cultured or courtly of all the clans their duty is to guard the wall that separates the empire of rokugan from the foul and tainted shadowlands families of the crab clan are hida hiruma kaiu kuni toritaka yasuki colors of the crab are grey and dark blue crane clan the crane clan is considered the most artistic of all the clans they are the emperor s left hand they are known throughout the empire for their trained courtiers and duelists the families of the crane clan are asahina daidoji doji kakita yasuki the crane s colors are white and light blue dragon clan the dragon clan controls the mountains to the north of the empire they are aloof and removed from the affairs of the empire families of the clan include hitomi hoshi kitsuki mirumoto tamori togashi and formerly the agasha the agasha have since joined the phoenix the colors of the dragon clan are emerald green and gold lion clan the lion clan is known as a very aggressive and honor driven clan they are the emperor s right hand personally defending his causes above all else lion families are akodo ikoma kitsu matsu the lion clan uses brown and yellow as their colors mantis clan the mantis clan started as a group of minor clans that banded together under the banner of one powerful man yoritomo they are the only new great clan as previously the requirement for such recognition was being founded at the founding of rokugan they are known for their seafaring ability and their fine silks mantis families are moshi tsuruchi yoritomo the mantis favor silver and green as their colors phoenix clan the phoenix clan is known as the most skilled with magic in the empire they have schools of magic associated with each element including the empire s only school dealing with void magic phoenix families are agasha asako isawa shiba the phoenix colors are red and

unicorn are moto horiuchi ide iuchi shinjo utaku formerly otaku the unicorn s colors are purple and white minor clans there are many minor clans in rokugan clans that have been formed since the birth of the empire by those other than the seven kami new clans are not founded lightly the founders of these clans generally performed some extraordinarily valiant deed or favor for the empire among the minor clans are hare clan ox clan sparrow clan monkey clan tortoise clan bat clan oriole clan dragonfly clan the dragonfly clan was subsequently wiped out in a war between the lion and the dragon other regions burning sands the burning sands lie to the north and west of rokugan these lands consist mostly of vast stretches of desert where nomads roam the land and bitter wars are fought over the smallest reservoirs of water it is thematically based on a fantastic version of arabia ivory kingdoms the ivory kingdoms lie far to the west and south of rokugan past the shadowlands little is known of these islands and their inhabitants to the general populace of rokugan although secretly and illegally the mantis clan has been carrying on trade with this nation for some time it is thematically based on a fantasy version of india shadowlands the shadowlands border rokugan to the south and south west while not a nation per se this is a vile land where the very air can be poison and foul unholy creatures are summoned forth by dark powers to wage a never ending battle against all life in rokugan denizens in the world of rokugan there are many different and extraordinary creatures roaming the lands and humans are not the only beings to have developed a civilization humans the great majority of the population of rokugan are humans humans almost exclusively make up the population of the clans great and minor as well as the other groups within rokugan the number of non human members of rokugan s clans throughout history can probably be counted on one s fingers kenku the kenku are an ancient race resembling very large humanoid crows kenku are legendary swordsmen and are at least in legend responsible for training some of the most famous rokugani swordsmen in history seeing a kenku is rare and getting one to take on a student is nearly impossible these creatures have removed themselves from rokugan almost entirely their appearance is of a large crow standing upright and whose wings can be flexed and used as arms naga the naga are an ancient race of creatures who appear half human half serpent long before the rise of rokugan the naga had a vast and vibrant civilization at some point in pre history however the entire race of naga entered a deep sleep where they remained for nearly 100 000 years they awakened briefly during the second day of thunder but after a few short years of involvement in rokugani affairs they once again returned to their slumber nezumi the ratlings are a race of large intelligent rats they currently live in squalor barely better than animals although they claim to have once had an extensive advanced society unfortunately this civilization was entirely within what has become the shadowlands and was presumably destroyed when the dark kami fu leng fell to the earth zokujin the copper goblins are small creatures with wiry hair and heads vaguely resembling those of frogs they have extraordinary natural tunneling abilities being that they eat rock for nourishment this is little surprise because of this they are often used involuntarily more often than not by the clans of rokugan in their various mines zokujin

 id=60161 title the maltese falcon nonfiltered 1029 processed 1013 dbindex 1561043 the maltese falcon 1930 is a detective novel by dashiell hammett that has been adapted several times for the cinema the main character sam spade appears only in three lesser known short stories and this novel yet is widely cited as the crystallizing figure in the development of the hard boiled private detective genre spade was a departure from hammett s perennially nameless and less than glamorous detective the continental op sam spade combined several features of previous detectives most notably his cold detachment keen eye for detail and unflinching determination to achieve his own justice he is the man who has seen the wretched the corrupt the tawdry side of life but still retains his tarnished idealism raymond chandler based philip marlowe initially on hammett s spade and developed the character beyond its inspirational origin plot private eye sam spade and his partner miles archer are approached by brigid o shaughnessy who is using a pseudonym at the time to follow a man floyd thursby who allegedly ran off with her younger sister brigid o shaughnessy acts very innocently like a prim proper schoolgirl the two accept the assignment but spade also implies that the woman looks like trouble that night spade gets a call from detective tom polhaus and learns that archer has been shot and killed while tailing thursby he calls his secretary effie to let her know and to tell her to keep miles s wife iva away from him soon afterwards two officers visit spade at his apartment in the middle of the night they inquire about spade s whereabouts in the last few hours spade gets defensive and asks what the visit is really about the officers say that a few hours after archer was killed thursby was also killed and that spade is a suspect they have no evidence against spade at the moment but tell him that they will be conducting an investigation into the matter just before they leave they mention that if charges are filed against spade they will try to be understanding since most likely thursby shot his partner archer the next day spade also gets a visit from archer s wife apparently spade is having an affair with her the widow asks spade if he killed off miles so that they could be together spade dismisses her and tells her to leave then spade coldly orders effie his secretary to remove all of archer s belongings from the office later spade is visited by another man joel cairo cairo offers spade 5000 if the private eye can retrieve a figurine of a black bird that has recently arrived spade replies 5000 is a lot of money while at this point spade has no idea what the man is talking about he plays along cairo leaves a card and tells spade to contact him should anything develop still later spade is again contacted by brigid o shaughnessy she offers her sympathies for the death of his partner saying that she should have known that thursby might get desperate and resort to murder spade coldly replies that these are the chances people take in this line of work spade also asks bluntly if brigid o shaughnessy is really as naive as she acts brigid o shaughnessy replies that she hasn t led a good life spade then sensing a connection between brigid o shaughnessy and cairo casually mentions that cairo has contacted him brigid o shaughnessy gets extremely nervous when she hears this she tells spade that she must meet with cairo and asks spade to arrange a meeting spade agrees when cairo and brigid o shaughnessy meet they make references that the reader and spade don t initially comprehend cairo says he is ready pay for the black figurine brigid o shaughnessy however says she does not have it at the moment brigid o shaughnessy also refers to a mysterious figure known as g and says he may also be in town the two then continue talk about some events that happened overseas eventually cairo makes an insinuation that brigid o shaughnessy simply uses her body to get what she wants this causes the two to get into a fight at this point the police officers that stopped by the other night drop by again spade greets them at the door but refuses to let them in the officers say they know spade was having an affair with archer s wife and ask if he also killed him spade replies that this accusation is absurd since there would be no rational motive for him to kill both archer and thursby just as the officers are about to leave they hear cairo and brigid o shaughnessy screaming in the back at this point they force their way into spade s apartment they ask what is going on but spade invents a story that involves describing how cairo and o shaughnessy were just play acting one of the officers replies horsefeathers and slugs spade across the face spade is incensed but gets held back by the other officer the officers seem to buy spade s story and eventually leave and they also want to take cairo with them down to the station for some grilling the next morning spade makes his way to the hotel belvedere where cairo is staying cairo shows up dishevelled saying that he was held in police custody through the night meanwhile spade notices that he s being tailed by some kid named wilmer cook he confronts the gunsel and tells him that both he and his boss g will have to deal with him at some point later he receives a call from a casper gutman who wishes to meet with him spade immediately arrives at gutman s hotel gutman is a huge person weighing over 300 lbs gutman says he will pay handsomely for the black bird spade implies that he can get the item though at this point this is a bluff but wants to know what it is first gutman is reluctant to tell spade what it is spade pretends to get angry with gutman at this point and storms out of the hotel in a fit of rage grinning on his way out at the manner in which gutman bought his bluff as spade arrives back at his office he gets a call from the district attorney he goes down to the da s office for an informal chat relating to his practice as a pi the da asks what spade knows about the archer and thursby murders spade replies that he has some clue but that he s not dumb enough to make guesses in front of a da along with stenographer present he goes on to say that just because he isn t saying anything doesn t make him guilty since everybody even innocent people always have something to hide finally he says he s tired of being called things by every crackpot on the city payroll and that at this point the best way for him to clear his name is to bring all the suspects in himself and the best way to do this is to stay as far away as possible from the police since they are all incompetent and would only gum up the works after the da visit spade approached by wilmer cook discovers that gutman is ready to see him again spade goes back to the hotel and meets with gutman once more gutman offers spade a drink then proceeds to tell him about the black figurine it turns out that the figurine was a gift from the island of malta to the king of spain a few hundred years ago but was lost on ship in transit it is really covered with fine jewels but over the centuries it acquired a layer of black enamel so as to conceal its value gutman learned of its whereabouts 17 years ago and has been looking for it ever since he wants the bird since it is worth millions he traced it to the home of a russian general then sent three of his agents cairo thursby and brigid o shaughnessy to get it the latter supposedly did retrieve the figurine but learned of its value and decided to keep it for themselves gutman then asks spade when he is willing to produce the bird and begins to offer him some options of paying him spade starts to get dizzy at this point and when he goes to leave wilmer trips him and knocks him out by kicking his temple when spade awakens he returns to his office and tells the story of the maltese falcon to his secretary effie soon afterwards an injured man identified as captain jacobi of the la paloma shows up at the office carrying a package he drops the package on the floor and then dies of gunshot wounds spade opens the package and finds out it is the figurine falcon at this point brigid o shaughnessy calls effie whom she was supposed to have taken shelter with earlier and says that she s in danger effie begs spade to go help her though reluctant spade agrees he tells effie to call the police after he leaves and to tell them exactly what has happened but to leave out the package and to say that he not she got the phone call from o shaugnessy to prevent losing the item spade then stores the package at a bus station left luggage counter and mails himself the collection tag in the 1931 film he takes the bird to a post office and mails it back to himself at his office address he first goes to the dock where the la paloma was anchored but learns that a fire had been started on board he then proceeds to the place rhea gutman gutman s daughter replaced with brigid o shaughnessy in the movie said she was when she phoned earlier only to find no sign of her he realizes that it was a decoy or bum steer frustrated he then returns to his apartment as he arrives he notices o shaughnessy waiting for him outside in the movie she s fainting at his doorway and he rushes to help her he helps her in to his apartment and finds that wilmer cook joel cairo and gutman are already there cook attempts to be rough with spade but each time the kid tries this spade challenges him to shoot knowing that at this point he has the bird and that they cannot afford to kill him gutman hands spade 10 000 in cash in exchange for the bird spade takes the money but in addition says that they need a fall guy to take the blame for the murders of archer thursby and jacobi the others acknowledge this but reply that it is really two murders since the police will accept that thursby killed archer spade knows that the police will not accept this as the bullets did not match up spade proposes that the kid wilmer be made the fall guy but initially gutman won t hear of it spade replies that without a fall guy he won t produce the figurine gutman then threatens spade but spade replies that in this situation threats are useless without a hint of death in the background to tie the person down at this point if they force spade to do something he doesn t want to do he won t stand for it and will make a point of their having to kill him knowing that they can t afford to kill him gutman replies that this is an extremely dangerous attitude since once men s emotions get in the way they are likely to forget their best interest spade in turn replies that he needs to make his play strong enough to tie them down but not so strong that it makes them kill against their better judgement eventually during the standoff spade attacks wilmer and knocks him out reluctantly both cairo and gutman agree to make wilmer the fall guy gutman then proceeds to tell spade the missing pieces of the story it turns out that thursby and brigid o shaughnessy initially helped gutman get the bird from the russian general but once they had it they fled with it and came to the us the night that thursby was killed he was first approached by wilmer and gutman the latter attempted to reason with him but thursby remained loyal to brigid o shaughnessy and refused to cooperate later things escalated then wilmer shot thursby also gutman says that recently he and cairo have joined together to get the falcon gutman learned from cairo that during their ship voyage to the us brigid o shaughnessy had seduced captain jacobi and hid the falcon with him later brigid o shaughnessy instructed jacobi to deliver the package to spade once gutman learned of this fact he attempted to remove spade from the situation with the spiked drink and later forced brigid o shaughnessy to act like she was in danger however gutman was ultimately too late to intercept jacobi wilmer managed to shoot the captain but jacobi still got to spade s office to deliver the figurine after finishing his story gutman finally warns spade to be very careful with brigid o shaughnessy as she is not to be trusted spade then places a call to his secretary effie and asks her to go the office and pick up the figurine as by now the post office should have delivered the collection tag effie does so and brings it to spade s apartment spade hands the package to gutman who at this time is overwhelmed with excitement he checks the figurine but quickly learns that it is a fake most likely created by the russian as a decoy getting criticised by cairo at the same time who blames it on gutman s hyping up of the worth of the artifact overseas which caused it to be swapped during this time wilmer manages to escape from spade s apartment gutman quickly regains composure and decides to go back to europe to continue the search before he leaves gutman asks spade for the 10 000 spade returns 9000 saying he s keeping the remainder for his time and expenses then cairo and gutman leave spade s apartment immediately after cairo and gutman leave spade phones the police department and tells them the entire story wilmer killed jacobi and thursby he also tells them what hotel gutman is staying at and urges them to hurry since gutman and cairo are leaving town soon afterwards spade angrily asks brigid o shaughnessy why she killed miles archer at first brigid o shaughnessy acts horrified at this accusation but seeing that she cannot lie anymore she drops the act she wanted to get thursby out of the picture so that she could have the falcon for herself so she hired archer to scare him off when thursby didn t leave she killed archer and attempted to pin the crime on thursby when thursby was later killed himself she knew that gutman was in town and that she needed another protector so she came back to spade however she says that she s also in love with spade and would have come back to him anyhow spade coldly replies that the penalty for murder is most likely twenty years and he ll wait for her until she gets out if they hang her spade says that he ll always remember her he goes on to say that while he despised miles archer the man was his partner and that he s going to turn her in to the police for his murder as that was a line he could not cross in the industry of detective work brigid o shaughnessy begs him not to but he replies that he has no choice when the police get gutman gutman will finger sam and brigid as accomplices thus the only way spade can avoid getting charged is to say he played both sides against each other he tells brigid o shaughnessy that he has some feelings for her but that he simply can t trust her from what spade has seen brigid o shaughnessy makes a profession out of using men to get what she wants and he simply doesn t want to be another one of them just before the police arrive brigid o shaughnessy asks spade if the falcon had been real and he d gotten the entire 10 000 would it have made a difference spade replies that while she shouldn t be so sure that he s crooked more money would have been one more item on her side when the police finally show up at spade s apartment spade immediately turns over brigid o shaughnessy as archer s killer they tell spade that the kid wilmer was waiting for gutman at the hotel and shot him when he arrived spade also hands over the 1000 in bill and the falcon to the police as evidence later when spade arrives back at the office he tells his secretary effie the entire story she asks sam if he sent brigid o shaughnessy to jail he smugly replies your sam s a detective she is disgusted by his actions and asks him not to touch her the novel ends when archer s widow again shows up at the office analysis in this novel hammett redefines many of the conventions of the hard boiled detective genre spade is a bitter sardonic character who lets the police and the criminals think he is in with the criminals while he works singlemindedly to catch the crooks brigid o shaughnessy is the classic femme fatale the other crooks are manipulative and self centered or merely self centered with no concern for anyone s well being except their own however unlike some other hard boiled detectives who have a strong sense of idealism underneath the cynical shell we are never given a clear statement of spade s notion of morality he attempts to explain himself to brigid o shaughnessy with the flitcraft parable in which hammett makes an oblique reference to the philosopher charles sanders peirce but o shaughnessy and most readers have no idea what he is getting at at the time of miles archer s death spade is having an affair with archer s wife and while he does do the right thing in the end it is somewhat ambiguous as to why he does so it is left unclear whether he does this because the money was simply not enough a lot more money would have been one more item on your side for the risk film tv or theatrical adaptations the novel has been filmed three times twice under its original title the maltese falcon 1931 the first version pre code production starring ricardo cortez and bebe daniels satan met a lady 1936 a light comedy adaptation starring bette davis with sam spade becoming ted shane the maltese falcon 1941 the third version considered to be a film noir classic starring humphrey bogart peter lorre and sydney greenstreet there have been many spoofs and sequels including 1975 s the black bird a spoof sequel featuring george segal as sam spade jr and elisha cook jr and lee patrick reprising their roles from the 1941 version notes see also the apartment of dashiell hammett and sam spade the pickwick hotel

named gundam sentinel the series ran from 1987 until its conclusion in the month of august in 1988 gundam sentinel became a cult hit due to the super detailed mechanical designs of the series and the intricate story by veteran writer and gundam fan masaya takahashi gundam sentinel took a much more realistic look at the gundam world where mobile suits were seen more as fighter jets or military weapons rather than as cartoonish robots it was also the debut of hajime katoki who has come to be one of gundam s most prolific mechanical designers it is now perhaps the most well known of gundam side stories set during the same timeline as gundam double zeta which is the sequel to zeta gundam after the fall of the titans the federation sends an expeditionary force called task force alpha to deal with a group of elite federation officers who ve formed their own earth supremacist faction called the new desides the series introduced a more realistic technical style of thinking that created some of the most impressive designs from the gundam universe mobile suits were larger their weapons more powerful then their predecessors the characters were older and the plot was on a less grand scale than what is usually found in gundam it can be said that gundam sentinel was made for the mature gundam fan the series was never animated although a short animated tv commercial for an s gundam model kit was made or released as manga however the model kits continue to be popular with gundam fans and new sentinel designs crop up every now and then after gundam sentinel completed its run all

 id=3360563 title the brookline boston annexation issue of 1873 nonfiltered 1050 processed 1034 dbindex 1561064 on october 7 1873 brookline became the first town in america to reject annexation by a larger neighboring city when its citizens voted 706 299 to keep its independence brookline not only stopped boston s string of annexations it also set an example for wealthy suburbs throughout america that day in 1873 can be seen as either a turning point or a launching pad for american suburban culture the development of anti annexationist brookline in 1686 a community of farmers to the west of boston separated itself into a semi autonomous hamlet called muddy river less than twenty years later in 1705 the muddy river hamlet was incorporated as an independent town called brookline during the 168 years between its creation and boston s attempt to annex it in 1873 brookline grew immensely first as a farming community and later as a commuting town this development helps to explain many of the reasons why boston s attempt to annex brookline ultimately failed at first brookline was no different from other rural towns in massachusetts but towards the end of the eighteenth century it became an increasingly attractive location for the wealthy bostonian elite this led to a great increase in brookline s population for example between 1840 and 1850 the population almost doubled going from 1 365 to 2 516 although the town s population quickly increased during the first half of the nineteenth century this sudden growth did not much change brookline s idyllic rural makeup the second half of the nineteenth century however saw brookline develop from a purely rural town to essentially a residential neighborhood for wealthy bostonians the town had quickly changed it no longer supplied raw materials for the city it now supplied land for the city s elite the property in brookline had become too valuable for the large plots required for farming so farmers who only needed to visit boston sporadically and thus did not necessarily rely on their proximity to the city moved away from the state s economic hub farmland was converted into estates for affluent upper class and upper middle class families the men who headed these households were often lawyers businessmen or other highly educated professionals who had offices in boston and thus commuted there on a daily basis such a wealthy population would not however go unsupported a working class population had to supply the basic daily labor that sustains the way of life of the upper class brookline quickly developed a largely irish working population the irish potato famine of the late 1840 s created a great migration of willing laborers to the united states many of these immigrants were settling in massachusetts as brookline s population quickly grew and the need for manual worker increased a large group of irish families settled in an area close to brookline village known as the marsh the brookline elite obviously worried about the influx of irishmen into this previously rather community first and foremost they worried about the impoverished shanties filled with morally disagreeable roman catholics moreover they worried that their decadent living conditions in a swampy district would create a hotbed for dangerous diseases in the end though the local population had to accept that the influx of lower class families was absolutely necessary for any wealthy town s economic well being this dichotomy between the upper class american citizens and the lower class irish immigrants was made even clearer by the virtually complete lack of a middle class due to the fact that daily transportation into boston in the nineteenth century was too expensive for all but the wealthy the only inhabitants of brookline were the upper class and those who supported them since the support class rarely needed to travel into boston by the late nineteenth century forty percent of brookline s population was irish even after the irish influx brookline could still be described as a homogeneous town now however there were two separate homogeneous communities instead of just one in a few years brookline s social simplicity would greatly assist the anti annexation movement the annexation issue in the five years leading to the attempted annexation of brookline some of boston s most influential suburbs became part of the city the annexations of roxbury in 1868 dorchester in 1870 and charlestown brighton and west roxbury in 1873 all increases the area and population of the state capital see history of boston massachusetts for a complete list for these communities annexation was an achievement there was interest in uniting the place where they lived and the place where they worked under a single political entity moreover these communities realized that boston could provide certain services that they would have a hard time obtaining for themselves in roxbury s case for example boston s water supply and sewage systems were strong stimuli for the annexation movement brookline however was socially distinct from its neighboring towns that voted in favor of annexation the elitism of its ruling upper class population which had no middle class to counter it led to a sense that brookline was much more capable than boston many citizens did see the benefits of becoming part of the metropolis but in the end the ruling class found it beneficial to have more direct control over its government brookline s form of government the town meeting allowed every adult male citizen to cast a vote on every law while a board of five selectmen was elected as the executive branch of the government while the anti annexationists viewed this as the most democratic form of government a town could have opponents claimed that boston s more centralized representative political structure could better serve the needs of the community without the threat of corruption the reluctance to let go of the current system led to accusations by the annexationists that the upper class was coercing the working class irishmen into siding with them since the irish immigrants relied on the ruling elite to supply them with jobs the truth however is that it was in the irishmen s best interest to keep brookline separated from boston if the status quo did not change brookline s irishmen would maintain their monopoly over all the manual labor done in the town thus they benefited from the continual separation between the two communities although there were big ideological issues behind the annexation issues such as the anti annexationists claim that the metropolis went against the american ideal of republican liberties the argument always eventually boiled down to specific local concerns as with most political questions it was a matter of private gain for many of the political figures that led either side important people many of those who wished to join boston wanted it because they would benefit from the city s resources john w candler one of the leading annexationists was probably interested in the possibility of an increase in property value that could affect the undeveloped lands that the brookline land company which he directed controlled in northern brookline on the other side of the argument were two men who were very different from each other the upper class leader of the anti annexationists was william aspinwall born into a wealthy traditional brookline family aspinwall studied law at harvard despite the fact that he was a democrat in a strongly republican town he was a brookline selectman his strong connection to brookline politics did not stop aspinwall from commuting to his law office in boston on a daily basis even though william aspinwall could successfully gather the votes of the upper class a much more intriguing individual was needed to unite the working class community against annexation this man an alcohol smuggler named john mccormack was the charismatic leader of the irish population mccormack surely benefited from the fact that brookline s police force was small enough that by befriending the right people he could get away with practicing his illicit business on the other hand he seems to have truly cared about the irish working population always standing as the righteous leader of the community the outcome on a rainy tuesday morning brookline s adult male population came together to vote on a referendum that would forever affect the fate of the town under the heavy propaganda of the anti annexationists and a fairly disorganized annexationist force the electorate voted to keep brookline independent by a wide margin on october 7 1873 706 brookliners voted to keep the city independent against only 299 who voted to accept annexation as kenneth jackson points out in his book crabgrass frontier the first really significant defeat for the consolidation movement came when brookline spurned boston this was according to jackson the starting point for a massive suburbanization campaign that swept the united states and greatly influenced the american way of life after brookline spurned boston jackson says virtually every other eastern and middle western city was rebuffed by wealthy and independent suburbs chicago by oak park and evanston rochester by brighton and irondequoit and oakland by the rest of alameda county and as the suburban trend gained momentum state legislators became increasingly reluctant to override the wishes of the voters concerned the advantages of boston s water treatment system the strengths of a larger centralized government and worries about the morality of being a commuter who paid no taxes at all to boston were all subdued by the ultimate desire for exclusivity brookliners knew they were wealthier than bostonians and they were ready to forego the benefits of being part of a larger city in order to remain in complete control of their small segregated elite community although brookline may not have been america s first suburb it was the first town to epitomize the ideas of the american suburb brookline was the first community that when given a choice

father died early and he was raised by his grandmother in a series of mediterranean towns he was a headstrong youth and after graduating high school he dropped out of the university of paris where he had been studying law he became a revolutionary poet writer and film maker founding the lettrist international schism with gil j wolman in the 1960s he led the situationist international group which influenced the paris uprising of 1968 his book society of the spectacle 1967 was a major catalyst for the uprising in the 1970s debord disbanded the situationist movement and resumed filmmaking with financial backing from the movie mogul gerard lebovici his two best films date from this period a film version of society of the spectacle 1973 and the autobiographical in girum imus nocte et consumimur igni 1981 after the dissolution of the situationist international debord became increasingly self isolated and his writings more pessimistic his lifelong alcoholism began to take a toll on

journals potlatch les levres nues and internationale situationniste in broad terms debord s theories attempted to account for the spiritually debilitating modernisation of both the private and public spheres of everyday life by economic forces during the post ww2 modernisation of europe he rejected as the twin faces of the same problem both capitalism of the west and the statism of the eastern bloc alienation debord postulated could be accounted for by the invasive forces of the spectacle the seductive nature of capitalism debord s analysis developed the notions of reification and fetishism of the commodity pioneered by karl marx and georg lukács this analysis probed the historical economic and psychological roots of the media central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology rather it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization which has reached its climax in capitalism the situationist international a political artistic movement organized by debord and his colleagues and represented by a journal of the same name attempted to create a series of strategies for engaging in class struggle by reclaiming individual autonomy from the spectacle these strategies including derive and detournement drew on the traditions of dada and surrealism the si initially drew membership from the lettrists a post surrealist group of writers and poets dedicated to the destruction of bourgeois values by reducing the written word to onomatopoeic syllables however the si broke with the formal aims of the lettrists and after subsuming much of their membership were fully established in their own right by 1959 after an intense period of theoretical analysis publication and the expulsion of most of its few members the si dissolved itself in 1972 debord s first book memoires was bound with a sandpaper cover so that it would destroy other books placed next to it debord has

state could sign them instead the secretary of state signed all passports in place of the monarch from 1794 onwards at which time formal records started to be kept passports were written in latin or english until 1772 when french was used instead from 1858 english was used with some sections translated into french until 1921 in 1858 passports became a standard document issued solely to british nationals until 1915 they were a simple single sheet paper document and included a photograph of the holder the british nationality and status of aliens act 1914 was passed on the outbreak of the first world war at this time a new format was introduced a single sheet folded into eight and containing a cardboard cover it included a description of the holder as well as a photograph and had to be

also include the person s spouse and another for families which included their children as well various changes to the design were made over the years in 1954 the name of the secretary of state was removed in 1968 the validity was extended from two to ten years at the end of 1972 several modifications were made a special blue watermarked paper was introduced to make alteration and forgery harder

readable passports later in the year joint and family passports were no longer issued and the descriptions of distinguishing features and height were removed the british visitor s passport a new type the british visitor s passport was introduced in 1961 and was a single page cardboard document valid for a year and obtainable from a post office it was recognised by most west european countries but

issue burgundy coloured machine readable passports they followed a common format agreed amongst member states of the european community and had the words european community on the cover this was

guardian the information contained on a biometric passport can be viewed using readily available hardware and software information is stored in encrypted form on an rfid tag with the password as a combination of information written on the passport so that anyone with access to the passport will be able to read the chip the passport is also vulnerable to brute force attacks and because it is possible to read the rfid tags remotely at a distance of several centimetres it is not necessary to be in possession of the passport to extract the data as a result the cloning of the passport is a possibility because the biometric passport is supposedly highly secure and therefore trusted it is thought that the holder of a cloned passport might be more likely to escape detection than the holder

 id=2666669 title counter trade nonfiltered 1081 processed 1065 dbindex 1561095 countertrade is exchanging goods or services that are paid for in whole or part with other goods or services types of countertrade there are five main variants of countertrade barter exchange of goods or services directly for other goods or services without the use of money as means of purchase or payment switch trading practice in which one company sells to another its obligation to make a purchase in a given country counter purchase sale of goods and services to a country by a company that promises to make a future purchase of a specific product from the country buyback export of industrial equipment in return for products produced by that equipment offset agreement that a company will offset a hard currency purchase of an unspecified product from that nation in the future agreement by one nation to buy a product from another subject to the purchase of some or all of the components and raw materials from the buyer of the finished product or the assembly of such product in the buyer nation role of countertrade in the world market noted us economist paul samuelson was skeptical about the viability of countertrade as a marketing tool claiming that unless a hungry tailor happens to find an undraped farmer who has both food and a desire for a pair of pants neither can make a trade this is called double coincidence of wants but this is a too simplistic interpretation of how markets operate in the real world in any real economy bartering occurs all the time the truth is that the volume of countertrade is growing in 1972 it was estimated that countertrade was used by business and governments in 15 countries in 1979 27 countries by the start of 1990s around 100 countries vertariu 1992 more than 80 countries nowadays regularly use or require countertrade exchanges officials of the gatt organization claimed that countertrade accounts for around 5 of the world trade the british department of trade and industry has suggested 15 while numerous scholars believe it to be closer to 30 with east west trade having been as high as 50 in some trading sectors of eastern european and third world countries a consensus of expert opinions okaroafo 1989 has put the percentage of the value of world trade volumes linked to countertrade transactions at between 20 to 25 desirability of countertrade according to an official us statement the u s government generally views countertrade including barter as contrary to an open free trading system and in the long run not in the interest of the u s business community however as a matter of policy the u s government will not oppose u s companies participation in countertrade arrangements unless such action could have a negative impact on national security office of management and budget impact of offsets in defense related exports december 1985 a large part of countertrade has involved military sales but countertrade also occurs when countries lack sufficient hard currency or when other types of market trade are impossible in 2000 india and iraq agreed on an oil for wheat and rice barter deal subject to un approval under article 50 of the un gulf war sanctions that would facilitate 300 000 barrels of oil delivered daily to india at a price of 6 85 a barrel while iraq oil sales into asia were valued at about 22 a barrel in 2001 india agreed to swap 1 5 million tonnes of iraqi crude under the oil for food program the security council noted although locally produced food items have become increasingly available throughout the country most iraqis do not have the necessary purchasing power to buy them unfortunately the monthly food rations represent the largest proportion of their household income they are obliged to either barter or sell items from the food basket in order to meet their other essential needs this is one of the factors which partly explains why the nutritional situation has not improved in line with the enhanced food basket moreover the absence of normal economic activity has given rise to the spread of deep seated poverty references vertariu p 1992 trends

due to a vacancy or a challenge to the incumbent leader overview unlike in the united states where political conventions are held every four years to choose the party s presidential nominee in canada the leader of a party generally remains that party s de facto candidate for prime minister until such time as he or she dies resigns or is dismissed by the party in the new democratic party and some of its provincial branches the position of party leader was treated as all other positions on the party s executive committee and open for election at party conventions generally held every two years though incumbent leaders rarely face more than token opposition traditionally each riding association of a party holds a special meeting to elect a fixed number of delegates to represent it at a leadership convention these meeting would often select alternate delegates or alternates who would attend the convention but vote only if one of the delegates from the riding association was unable to attend in addition delegates are often selected by the party s youth and women s associations in each riding and party associations at university and college campuses in addition to the elected delgates a large number of ex officio delegates attend and vote at leadership conventions these ex officio delegates are automatically entitled to attend by virtue of being an elected member of parliament for that party a member of an affiliated party in a provincial legislature a member of the party s national or provincial executive of the executive of an affiliated women s or youth organization due to the implementation of one member one vote omov systems and proportional delegate elections by most parties conventions have declined in importance in recent years the result of the vote is either known before the convention or the voting does not take place at the venue in a one member one vote system each party member casts a ballot to elect the leader and all ballots have equal weight the liberal party of canada held the first leadership convention in 1919 electing william lyon mackenzie king prior to that the leader of the party was chosen by the party s parliamentary caucus the historical conservative party used a leadership convention to select r b bennett as party leader in 1927 the parti québécois was the first political party in canada to adopt an omov system most provincial and federal parties adopted forms of omov in the 1990s until 2003 when it adopted an omov system every biennial convention of the co operative commonwealth federation and its successor the new democratic party in the twentieth century was a leadership convention however in practice contested elections were only held in the ndp when there was a declared leadership race both the modern conservative party and the ndp have instituted one member one vote systems in recent years the ndp has a modified system where the vote is calculated so that ballots cast by labour delegates have 25 weight in the total result while votes cast by party members have 75 the modern conservative party has adopted the progressive conservative party system of omov where each riding has equal weight in a point system the party s other predecessors the reform party of canada and canadian alliance had pure omov systems the liberals continue to use the delegate system but have adopted a system where delegates in a riding are apportioned by proportional representation the bloc québécois uses a pure omov system see also federal parties liberal leadership conventions new democratic

 id=1007978 title australian pound nonfiltered 1084 processed 1068 dbindex 1561098 the australian pound was australia s currency from 1910 to 1966 history australia s first coinage was issued in 1813 by the colony of new south wales it consisted of coins cut from spanish dollars a central plug known as the dump was worth 15 pence whilst the remaining ring known as the holey dollar was worth 5 shillings in 1852 the government assay office in adelaide issued gold pound coins these weighed slightly more than sovereigns from 1855 the sydney mint issued half sovereigns and sovereigns with the melbourne mint beginning production in 1872 it should be noted that many of the sovereigns minted in australia were for use in india in the early years of the australian federation the british pound sterling was used as the national unit of account british coins circulated together with locally minted copper trade tokens and alongside banknotes and bills of credit issued by private banks acceptance of private bank notes was not made compulsory by legal tender laws but they were widely used and accepted queensland treasury notes were also in circulation and these were legal tender in queensland in 1910 the federal government passed the australian notes act which prohibited the circulation of state notes also passed in that year was the bank notes tax act which imposed a tax of 10 per annum on all bank notes issued or re issued by any bank in the commonwealth after the commencement of this act and not redeemed both these acts remain on the statute books and perpetuate the prohibition of private currencies in australia also in 1910 a national currency was introduced by the labor government of prime minister andrew fisher the new national currency was called the australian pound consisting of 20 shillings each consisting of 12 pence monetary policy ensured that the australian pound was fixed in value to the pound sterling as such australia was on the gold standard so long as britain was in 1919 the pound sterling was removed from the gold standard when it was returned to the gold standard in 1926 the sudden increase in its value imposed by the nominal gold price unleashed crushing deflationary pressures both the initial 1919 inflation and the subsequent 1926 deflation had far reaching economic effects throughout the remnants of the british empire australia and the world in january 1931 the labor government of prime minister james scullin devalued the australian pound by 25 against pound sterling as an emergency measure during the great depression 1 sterling became worth 1 5s australian a 2 50 while this devaluation no doubt removed some of the deflationary pressures introduced five years earlier it would still have been disruptive in 1949 when the united kingdom devalued the pound sterling against the us dollar australian prime minister and treasurer ben chifley followed suit so the australian pound would not become over valued in sterling zone countries with which australia did most of its external trade at the time as one pound sterling went from us 4 03 to us 2 8 one australian pound went from us 3 224 to us 2 24 issuance in the lead up to federation the currency used in the australian colonies was the pound sterling divided into 20 shillings each of which was divided into 12 pence english silver and copper coins circulated alongside australian minted gold sovereigns worth one pound and half sovereigns as well as locally minted copper trade tokens banknotes were issued by private banks as well as certain colonial governments such as that of queensland paper denominations ranged from 1 to 100 pounds after federation in 1901 the australian government assumed the power to issue currency and began superscribing the private issues that were in circulation in preparation for the issue of a domestic currency coins in 1910 the first truly national australian silver coinage was introduced in denominations of threepence sixpence one shilling and two shillings one florin copper pennies and halfpennies followed in 1911 in 1937 a five shilling piece was issued to commemorate the coronation of king george vi this coin proved unpopular and was discontinued shortly after being reissued in 1938 another coin highly sought after by collectors is the penny dated 1930 its rarity is so well known amongst australians that demand for what is akin to a blue chip investment has pushed prices to approximately 35 000 australian dollars for an average standard example a proof example of the same coin recently changed hands for over 620 000 australian dollars making it the most expensive copper coin in the world banknotes in 1913 the first national banknotes were introduced in denominations of 10 shillings and 1 5 and 10 pounds 1914 saw the introduction of 20 50 100 and 1000 pound notes the 1000 pound note only saw limited circulation and was later confined to inter bank use there are no uncancelled examples of this note known to exist in private hands there was also a never issued 5 shilling note around this time frame in the mid 1920s a modified 10 shilling worded as half sovereign and reduced size 1 5 and 10 pound notes were issued with the side profile of king george v on the face these notes still referred to the currency s convertibility to gold on demand a newer 1000 pound note with the profile of george v was also prepared but never issued an unissued printer s trial of this note was discovered in london in 1996 and subsequently sold for a sum in excess of 200 000 australian dollars nonetheless this note is not recognised as a legitimate australian banknote issue during the great depression australian currency ceased to be redeemable for gold at the previously maintained rate of one gold sovereign for one pound currency subsequently a new series of legal tender notes were designed once again bearing the portrait of king george v in denominations of 10 shillings and 1 5 and 10 pounds these denominations and designs were maintained and modified to accommodate the portrait of king george vi in 1938 the coronation of queen elizabeth ii in 1953 saw the issue of a new portrait series of prominent persons in australia s history 10s matthew flinders 1 queen elizabeth ii 5 john franklin 10 arthur phillip 50 henry parkes this note was never issued to the public a few specimens exist in private hands and are worth a great deal to collectors unissued notes that were printed but never issued for circulation include 2 different 5 shillings a 1916 with stock destroyed in 1936 and a 1946 stock destroyed in 1953 both were printed with the reigning king s portrait two fifty pound notes were designed one from 1939 with king george vi and a 1951 as stated above both stocks of the 50 note were destroyed in 1958 a 1939 100 also exist with a brown green and pink colouration with stock destroyed in 1958 as well the last unissued note was a 1 000 with specimens arriving in 1923 and kept till 1928 after a decision not to use the denomination any further the reserve bank holds specimens of all the stated banknote denominations on to australian dollar on february 14 1966 a decimal currency known as the australian dollar was introduced after years of planning february 2 1963 had been initially planned as the date the new currency would be introduced but this date passed with no fanfare as no progress on developing the new currency had been made at that time 1 became 2 ten shillings became 1 and one shilling became ten cents amounts less than a shilling were converted thus in 1967 the australian dollar effectively left the sterling area for the first time when sterling devalued in 1967 against the us dollar the new australian

 id=263487 title trans fat nonfiltered 1098 processed 1082 dbindex 1561112 trans fatty acids commonly termed trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat and may be monounsaturated or polyunsaturated trans fats occur in small quantities in meat and dairy products from ruminants most trans fats consumed today however are industrially created as a side effect of partial hydrogenation of plant oils a process developed in the early 1900s and first commercialized as crisco in 1911 partial hydrogenation changes a fat s molecular structure raising its melting point and reducing rancidity but this process also results in a portion of the changed fat becoming trans fat unlike other fats trans fats are neither required nor beneficial for health eating trans fat increases the risk of coronary heart disease for these reasons health authorities worldwide recommend that consumption of trans fat be reduced to trace amounts trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils are generally considered to be more of a health risk than those occurring naturally trans fats are tightly regulated in a few countries must be disclosed on product labels in many others and are the central issue in several ongoing lawsuits particularly against fast food outlets many companies are voluntarily removing trans fats from their products or establishing trans free product lines chemically trans fats are made of the same building blocks as non trans fats but have a different shape in trans fat molecules the double bonds between carbon atoms characteristic of all unsaturated fats are in the trans rather than the cis configuration resulting in a straighter rather than kinked shape as a result trans fats are less fluid and have a higher melting point than the corresponding cis fats presence in food trans fats occur naturally in the milk and body fat of ruminants such as cows and sheep at a level of 2 5 of total fat natural trans fats which include conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid originate in the rumens of these animals animal based fats were once the only trans fats consumed but by far the largest amount of trans fat consumed today is created by the processed food industry as a side effect of partially hydrogenating unsaturated plant fats generally vegetable oils these hydrogenated fats have displaced natural solid fats and liquid oils in many areas notably in the fast food snack food fried food and baked good industries partially hydrogenated oils are attractive to food manufacturers for several reasons partial hydrogenation reduces rancidity and consequently increases product shelf life and decreases refrigeration requirements because baking requires semi solid fats partially hydrogenated oils can replace the animal fats traditionally used by bakers such as butter and lard they are also a readily available alternative to semi solid tropical oils such as palm oil because partially hydrogenated plant oils can replace animal fats the resulting products can be consumed barring other ingredient and preparation violations by adherents to kashrut kosher and halal as well as by adherents to vegetarianism in buddhism ahimsa in jainism and hinduism veganism and other forms of vegetarianism foods containing artificial trans fats formed by partially hydrogenating plant fats may contain up to 45 trans fat compared to their total fat baking shortenings generally contain 30 trans fats compared to their total fats while animal equivalents such as butter and lard contain 3 those margarines not reformulated to reduce trans fats may contain up to 15 trans fat by weight it has been established that trans fats in human milk fluctuate with maternal consumption of trans fat and that the amount of trans fats in the bloodstream of breastfed infants fluctuates with the amounts found in their milk reported percentages of trans compared to total fats in human milk range from 1 in spain 2 in france and 4 in germany to 7 in canada trans fats are also found in shortenings commonly used for deep frying in restaurants in the past the decreased rancidity of partially hydrogenated oils meant that they could be reused for a longer time than conventional oils recently however non hydrogenated vegetable oils have become available that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings as fast food chains routinely use different fats in different locations trans fat levels in products can have large variation for example an analysis of samples of mcdonald s french fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in new york city contained twice as much trans fat as in hungary and 28 times as much trans fat as in denmark where trans fats are restricted at kfc the pattern was reversed with hungary s product containing twice the trans fat of the new york product even within the us there was variation with fries in new york containing 30 more trans fat than those from atlanta nutritional guidelines the national academy of sciences nas advises the united states and canadian governments on nutritional science for use in public policy and product labeling programs their 2002 dietary reference intakes for energy carbohydrate fiber fat fatty acids cholesterol protein and amino acids contains their findings and recommendations regarding consumption of trans fat summary their recommendations are based on two key facts first trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health whether of animal or plant origin second while both saturated and trans fats increase levels of ldl cholesterol so called bad cholesterol trans fats also lower levels of hdl cholesterol so called good cholesterol this increases the risk of coronary heart disease chd the nas is concerned that dietary trans fatty acids are more deleterious with respect to chd than saturated fatty acids this analysis is supported by a 2006 new england journal of medicine nejm scientific review that states from a nutritional standpoint the consumption of trans fatty acids results in considerable potential harm but no apparent benefit because of these facts and concerns the nas has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption there is no adequate level recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats this is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease despite this concern the nas dietary recommendations have not recommended the elimination of trans fat from the diet this is because trans fat is naturally present in many animal foods and therefore in most non vegan diets its removal from ordinary diets might introduce undesirable side effects and nutritional imbalances if proper nutritional planning is not undertaken the nas has therefore recommended that trans fatty acid consumption be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet like the nas the world health organization has tried to balance public health goals with a practical level of trans fat consumption recommending in 2003 that trans fats be limited to less than 1 of overall energy intake the us national dairy council has asserted that the trans fats present in animal foods are of a different type than those in partially hydrogenated oils and do not appear to exhibit the same negative effects while a recent scientific review agrees with the conclusion stating that the sum of the current evidence suggests that the public health implications of consuming trans fats from ruminant products are relatively limited it cautions that this may be due to the relatively low consumption of trans fats from animal sources compared to artificial ones history nobel laureate paul sabatier worked in the 1890s to develop the chemistry of hydrogenation which enabled the margarine oil hydrogenation and synthetic methanol industries while sabatier only considered hydrogenation of vapours the german chemist wilhelm normann showed in 1901 that liquid oils could be hydrogenated and patented the process in 1902 in 1909 procter gamble acquired the us rights to the normann patent in 1911 they began marketing the first hydrogenated shortening crisco composed largely of partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil further success came from the marketing technique of giving away free cookbooks in which every recipe called for crisco hydrogenation strongly stimulated whaling as it made it possible to stabilize whale oil for human consumption production of hydrogenated fats increased steadily until the 1960s as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the us and other western countries at first the argument was a financial one due to lower costs however advocates also said that the unsaturated trans fats of margarine were healthier than the saturated fats of butter the center for science in the public interest cspi campaigned against the use of saturated fats for fast food cooking starting in 1984 when fast food companies replaced the saturated fat with partially hydrogenated unsaturated fats cspi s campaign against them ended while cspi defended trans fats in their 1987 nutrition action newsletter by 1992 cspi began to speak against trans fats and is currently strongly against their use there were suggestions in the scientific literature as early as 1988 that trans fats could be a cause of the large increase in coronary artery disease in 1994 it was estimated that trans fats caused 30 000 deaths annually in the us from heart disease chemistry from a chemical perspective fats are large e shaped molecules that support three fatty acid groups connected to a short backbone derived from glycerol what is commonly termed a trans fat is more accurately described as a fat that contains a trans fatty acid group fatty acid molecules consist of a backbone of carbon atoms each with attached hydrogen atoms as well as a carboxyl group located at the end of the molecule that we will not be concerned with in this discussion fatty acids are characterized as saturated or unsaturated based on the number of hydrogen atoms in the acid if the molecule contains the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms then it is saturated otherwise it is unsaturated carbon atoms are tetravalent forming four covalent bonds with other atoms while hydrogen atoms bond with only one other atom in saturated fatty acids each carbon atom is connected to its two neighbour carbon atoms as well as two hydrogen atoms see structure diagram below in unsaturated fatty acids the carbon atoms that are missing a hydrogen atom are joined by double bonds rather than single bonds see structure graphic below so that each carbon atom participates in four bonds hydrogenation of an unsaturated fatty acid refers to the addition of hydrogen atoms to the acid causing double bonds to become single ones as carbon atoms acquire new hydrogen partners to maintain four bonds per carbon atom full hydrogenation results in a molecule containing the maximum amount of hydrogen in other words the conversion of an unsaturated fatty acid into a saturated one partial hydrogenation results in the addition of hydrogen atoms at some of the empty positions with a corresponding reduction in the number of double bonds commercial hydrogenation is typically partial in order to obtain a malleable fat that is solid at room temperature but melts upon baking or consumption in most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids the hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bonds of the carbon chain cis configuration meaning on the same side in latin however partial hydrogenation reconfigures most of the double bonds that do not become chemically saturated twisting them so that the hydrogen atoms end up on different sides of the chain this type of configuration is called trans which means across in latin the same molecule containing the same number of atoms with a double bond in the same location can be either a trans or a cis fatty acid depending on the conformation of the double bond for example oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula c18h34o2 they both have a double bond 9 carbon atoms from the end of the molecule it is the conformation of this bond that sets them apart the conformation has implications for the physical chemical properties of the molecule the trans configuration is straighter while the cis configuration is noticeably kinked as can be seen from the following three dimensional representation the trans fatty acid elaidic acid has different chemical and physical properties owing to the slightly different bond configuration notably it has a much higher melting point 46 5 c rather than oleic acid s 13 5 c in food production the goal is not to simply change the configuration of double bonds while maintaining the same ratios of hydrogen to carbon instead the goal is to decrease the number of double bonds and increase the amount of hydrogen in the fatty acid this changes the consistency of the fatty acid and makes it less prone to rancidity in which free radicals attack double bonds production of trans fatty acids is therefore a side effect of partial hydrogenation researchers at the united states department of agriculture have investigated whether hydrogenation can be achieved without the side effect of trans fat production they varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted applying 1400 kpa 200 psi of pressure to soybean oil in a 2 litre vessel while heating it to between 140 c and 170 c the standard 140 kpa 20 psi process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40 trans fatty acid by weight compared to about 17 using the high pressure method blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil the high pressure processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6 trans fat based on current u s labelling requirements see below the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat the level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature and the length of time during hydrogenation trans fat levels may be measured measurement techniques include chromatography by silver ion chromatography on thin layer chromatography plates or small high performance liquid chromatography columns of silica gel with bonded phenylsulfonic acid groups whose hydrogen atoms have been exchanged for silver ions the role of silver lies in its ability to form complexes with unsaturated compounds gas chromatography and mid infrared spectroscopy are other methods in use health risks partially hydrogenated vegetable oils have been an increasingly significant part of the human diet for about 100 years particularly so in the latter half of the 20th century and some deleterious effects of trans fat consumption are scientifically accepted forming the basis of the health guidelines discussed above the exact biochemical methods by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research for example the mechanisms through which trans fats contribute to coronary heart disease are fairly well understood while the mechanism for trans fat s effect on diabetes is under investigation coronary heart disease the primary health risk identified for trans fat consumption is an elevated risk of coronary heart disease chd a comprehensive review of studies of trans fats was published in 2006 in the new england journal of medicine that concludes that there is a strong and reliable connection between trans fat consumption and chd the major evidence for the effect of trans fat on chd comes from the nurses health study nhs a cohort study that has been following 120 000 female nurses since its inception in 1976 in this study hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the nhs population during 14 years of followup he determined that a nurse s chd risk roughly doubled relative risk of 1 94 ci 1 43 to 2 61 for each 2 increase in trans fat calories consumed instead of carbohydrate calories by contrast it takes more than a 15 increase in saturated fat calories instead of carbohydrate calories to produce a similar increase in risk eating non trans unsaturated fats instead of carbohydrates reduces the risk of chd rather than increasing it hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption replacing 2 of food energy from trans fat with non trans unsaturated fats more than halves the risk of chd 53 by comparison replacing a larger 5 of food energy from saturated fat with non trans unsaturated fats reduces the risk of chd by 43 another study considered deaths due to chd with consumption of trans fats being linked to an increase in mortality and consumption of polyunsaturated fats being linked to a decrease in mortality there are two accepted tests that measure an individual s risk for coronary heart disease both blood tests the first considers ratios of two types of cholesterol the other the amount of a cell signalling cytokine called c reactive protein the ratio test is more accepted while the cytokine test may be more powerful but is still being studied the effect of trans fat consumption has been documented on each as follows cholesterol ratio this ratio compares the levels of ldl so called bad cholesterol to hdl so called good cholesterol trans fat behaves like saturated fat by raising the level of ldl but unlike saturated fat it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of hdl the net increase in ldl hdl ratio with trans fat is approximately double that due to saturated fat higher ratios are worse c reactive protein crp a study of over 700 nurses showed that those in the highest quartile of trans fat consumption had blood levels of crp that were 73 higher than those in the lowest quartile other effects there has been suggestion that the negative consequences of trans fat consumption go beyond the cardiovascular risk in general there is much less scientific consensus that eating trans fat specifically increases the risk of other chronic health problems cancer there is no scientific consensus that consumption of trans fats significantly increases cancer risks across the board the american cancer society states that a relationship between trans fats and cancer has not been determined however one recent study has found connections between trans fat and prostate cancer diabetes there is a growing concern that the risk of type 2 diabetes increases with trans fat consumption however consensus has not been reached for example one study found that risk is higher for those in the highest quartile of trans fat consumption another study has found no diabetes risk once other factors such as total fat intake and bmi were accounted for obesity research indicates that trans fat may increase weight gain and abdominal fat despite a similar caloric intake a 6 year experiment revealed that monkeys fed a trans fat diet gained 7 2 of their body weight as compared to 1 8 for monkeys on a mono unsaturated fat diet although obesity is frequently linked to trans fat in the popular media this is generally in the context of eating too many calories there is no scientific consensus connecting trans fat and obesity liver dysfunction trans fats are metabolized differently by the liver than other fats and interfere with delta 6 desaturase delta 6 desaturase is an enzyme involved in converting essential fatty acids to arachidonic acid and prostaglandins both of which are important to the functioning of cells fertility a study found each 2 increase in the intake of energy from trans unsaturated fats as opposed to that from carbohydrates was associated with a 73 greater risk of ovulatory infertility public response and regulation canada canada is one of the largest consumers of trans fats in the world in november 2004 an opposition day motion seeking a ban similar to denmark s was introduced by jack layton of the new democratic party and passed through the house of commons by an overwhelming 193 73 vote since december 2005 health canada has required that food labels list the amount of trans fat in the nutrition facts section for most foods generally products with less than 0 2 grams of trans fat per serving are considered to be free of trans fats and may be labelled as such although this leads to questions of serving sizes in canada trans fat quantities on labels include naturally occurring trans fats from animal sources in june 2006 a task force co chaired by health canada and the heart and stroke foundation of canada recommended a limit of 5 trans fat to total fat ratio in all products sold to consumers in canada 2 for tub margarines and spreads the amount was selected such that most of the industrially produced trans fats would be removed from the canadian diet and about half of the remaining trans fat intake would be of naturally occurring trans fats this recommendation has been endorsed by the canadian restaurant and foodservices association and the food and consumer products of canada has congratulated the task force on the report denmark denmark became the first country to introduce laws strictly regulating the sale of many foods containing trans fats in march 2003 a move which effectively bans partially hydrogenated oils the limit is 2 of fats and oils destined for human consumption it should be noted that this restriction is on the ingredients rather than the final products this regulatory approach has made denmark the only country in which it is possible to eat far less than 1 g of industrially produced trans fats on a daily basis even with a diet including prepared foods european union the european food safety authority was asked to produce a scientific opinion on trans fats united kingdom in october 2005 the food standards agency fsa asked for better labelling in the uk in the 29 july 2006 edition of the british medical journal an editorial also called for better labelling in january 2007 the british retail consortium announced that major uk retailers including asda boots co op iceland marks and spencer sainsbury s tesco and waitrose intend to cease adding trans fatty acids to their own products by the end of 2007 united states before 2006 consumers in the united states could not directly determine the presence or quantity of trans fats in food products this information could only be inferred from the ingredient list notably from the partially hydrogenated ingredients on july 11 2003 the food and drug administration fda issued a regulation requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the nutrition facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements the new labeling rule allowed for immediate voluntary compliance with mandatory compliance by january 1 2006 although companies may petition for an extension to january 1 2008 the regulation allows trans fat levels of less than 0 5 grams per serving to be labeled as 0 grams per serving the fda did not approve nutrient content claims such as trans fat free or low trans fat however the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods the fda defines trans fats as containing one or more trans linkages that are not in a conjugated system this is an important distinction as it distinguishes non conjugated synthetic trans fats from naturally occurring fatty acids with conjugated trans double bonds such as conjugated linoleic acid critics of the plan including fda advisor dr carlos camargo have expressed concern that the 0 5 gram per serving threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of trans fat this is because a person eating many servings of a product or eating multiple products over the course of the day may still consume a significant amount of trans fat this can be compared to canada in which the threshold is 0 2 grams despite this the fda estimates that by 2009 trans fat labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1 200 cases of coronary heart disease and 250 to 500 deaths each year this benefit is expected to result from consumers choosing alternative foods lower in trans fats as well as manufacturers reducing the amount of trans fats in their products some us cities are acting to reduce consumption of trans fats in may 2005 tiburon california became the first american city where all restaurants voluntarily cook with trans fat free oils new york city has embarked on a campaign to reduce consumption of trans fats noting that heart disease is the primary cause of resident deaths this has included a public education campaign see trans fat pamphlet and a request to restaurant owners to voluntarily eliminate trans fat from their offerings finding that the voluntary program was not successful new york city s board of health has solicited public comments on a proposal to ban artificial trans fats in restaurants the board voted to ban trans fat in restaurant food on december 5 2006 new york is the first large us city to strictly limit trans fats in restaurants restaurants will be barred from using most frying and spreading fats containing artificial trans fats above 0 5 g per serving by july 1 2007 and will have to meet the same target in all of their foods by july 1 2008 chicago is also considering a ban on oils containing trans fats for large chain restaurants on december 19th 2006 massachusetts state representative peter koutoujian filed the first state level legislation that would ban restaurants from preparing foods with trans fats food industry response some major food chains have chosen to remove or reduce trans fats in their products in some cases these changes have been voluntary in other cases however food vendors have been targeted by legal action that has generated a lot of media attention in may 2003 bantransfats com inc a u s non profit corporation filed a lawsuit against the food

kirkland in 1933 and ran for a then astounding eight years 3182 performances a 1941 film version deliberately played mainly for laughs was directed by john ford and the storyline was considerably altered plot introduction tobacco road takes place in georgia during the worst years of the great depression it depicts a family of poor white tenant farmers the lesters as one of the many small southern cotton farmers estranged by the industrialization of production and the migration into cities the main character of the novel is jeeter lester an ignorant and sinful man who is redeemed by his love of the land and his faith in the fertility and the promise of soil plot summary the novel begins with lov bensey a friend of the lesters walking to his home at the train yard coal chute he has walked seven and a half miles to get a sack of winter turnips for fifty cents which is half of his daily wage on his way home he stops by the lesters to talk to jeeter about jeeter s twelve year old daughter pearl who is married to lov lov is worried for good reason that the lesters will try to steal his turnips because of their extreme poverty and hunger while lov is talking to jeeter the book introduces the reader to sixteen year old dude the youngest of the lester boys ada jeeter s wife grandma lester and ellie may an eighteen year old girl with a grotesque harelip the entire family acting in complete desperation works to steal the turnips from lov who then becomes nauseated by the sight and leaves for home at this point the preacher bessie emerges on the scene sister bessie like ellie may also has a deformity of the face bessie s nose contains no bone in it and so when looking straight at her face one can see straight into her nostrils like a pig despite this jeeter is still attracted to her she does some preaching and praying for everyone s sins and then proposes marriage to dude however dude is more interested in her offer of letting him drive the new automobile which she promises to purchase than in actually getting married to her bessie then goes home to ask god whether or not she and dude should get married jeeter has lived on the same plot of land since he was born and even though his standard of living continued to decline until he and his family began to starve jeeter stubbornly refused to move to the city to make a better life for himself by working in a cotton mill such a life he attested would be impossible for him to live alongside jeeter s preoccupation with farming the land was his preoccupation with his own imminent death ada as well was fixated on her death but their morbidity did not take the form of lamentation or self pity ada s main concern was that she was not buried in her tattered old out of style calico dress while jeeter s main concern was that his body would not be left in the old corn storage shed where it would be eaten by rats he held a terrible phobia of rats ever since he saw his father s dead face half eaten by them on the day of his funeral neither of these two characters had any doubts that they were going to die sometime soon and it was not their present life but their lifeless bodies which they cared about the most it is as if they realized that their way of life was already dead and their primary concern became not the preservation of that life but its appearance during burial after bessie returns the next day she exclaims that god has given his approval for the marriage between her and dude to proceed the two then start the long walk to the fuller so that they could purchase the new ford for the purpose of traveling around the country and preaching once they are in the auto showroom the salesmen take advantage of bessie s rural naiveté to pull off a quick and profitable sale while at the same time constantly making fun of her deformed nose the couple then head off to get their marriage certificate and are harassed by the county official who reprimands bessie for attempting to marry a boy of sixteen years finally they get the marriage license and the anxious dude gets to drive the automobile again over the course of the next two days the automobile slowly gets wrecked more and more first there is an accident with a wagon in which they end up killing the black driver and then dude drives into a stump the seats get trashed by jeeter s blackjack wood which he attempts to sell in the city and the engine becomes irreparably damaged by being run without sufficient oil on top of this the spare tire is sold for three dollars in order to pay for gasoline food and a night at a hotel where bessie becomes prostituted by the manager from room to room after all of this occurs bessie refuses to let jeeter ride in the car anymore which makes him upset to the point of kicking her off the land ada and jeeter then proceed to beat bessie and poke her with sticks until she and dude take off in the car in the process of fleeing from ada and jeeter s onslaught dude had backed right over grandma lester and she lay mashed into the dirt road almost dead lov runs down to see jeeter and asks him if he knows what happened to pearl lov s 12 year old wife who had run away to the city to be free of both lov and the bleak and desperate country life surrounding her jeeter notes that more than a few of his daughters have run away to the city after this discussion about the girls running away the two notice grandma s corpse and drag her into the field to dig her grave and bury her lov departs and caldwell reflects on jeeter s position as a tenant farmer in the south even though jeeter like so many others around him had the urge to plant a crop during this time of the year there was nothing he could do his landlord was an absentee and had abandoned jeeter and the rest of those who had lived on his land and given him shares of their crop in exchange for credit for seeds and fertilizer the stores in the city would not grant any more credit to jeeter or any of the other farmers because it was too risky and there were too many asking for it on this sad note the novel concludes as jeeter and ada sleep they are killed in the fire which spreads to their house and which jeeter created to burn off the hedge in the hopes of being able to somehow gain enough credit to farm the land that spring endofarticle doc doc

passionate delivery and posthumous hit single sittin on the dock of the bay according to the rock and roll hall of fame web site redding s name is synonymous with the term soul music that arose out of the black experience in america through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm blues into a form of funky secular testifying biography early life redding was born in the small town of dawson georgia at the age of 5 he moved with his family to macon georgia he sang in the choir of the vineville baptist church and became something of a local celebrity as a teenager after winning a local sunday night talent show 15 weeks in a row career in 1960 redding began touring the south with johnny jenkins and the pinetoppers that same year he made his first recordings she s all right and shout bamalama with this group under the name otis and the shooters in 1962 he made his first real mark in the music business during a johnny jenkins session when he recorded these arms of mine a ballad that redding had written the song became a minor hit on volt records a subsidiary of renowned southern soul label stax based in memphis tennessee his manager was fellow maconite phil walden who later founded capricorn records otis redding continued to release for stax volt and built his fanbase by extensively touring a legendarily electrifying live show with support from fellow stax artists sam and dave further hits between 1964 and 1966 included mr pitiful i can t turn you loose to become the blues brothers entrance theme music try a little tenderness i can t get no satisfaction written by the rolling stones and respect later a smash hit for aretha franklin redding wrote many of his own songs which was unusual for the time often with steve cropper of stax house band booker t the mg s who usually served as otis backing band in the studio soul singer jerry butler co wrote another hit i ve been loving you too long one of his few songs with a significant mainstream following was tramp 1967 with carla thomas later that year redding played at the massively influential monterey pop festival which helped him to break into the white pop music scene death redding and six others including four of the six members of redding s backup band the bar kays were killed when the plane on which they were travelling crashed into lake monona in madison wisconsin on december 10 1967 the two remaining members of the bar kays were ben cauley and james alexander cauley was the only person aboard redding s plane to survive the crash alexander was on another plane cauley reported that he had been asleep until just seconds before impact and recalled that upon waking he saw bandmate phalon jones look out a window and say oh no cauley said that he then unbuckled his seat belt and that was his final recollection before finding himself in the frigid waters of the lake grasping a seat cushion to keep himself afloat redding s body was recovered the next day when the lake bed was dragged with a grappling hook and footage exists of his body being brought out of the water the cause of the crash was never precisely determined redding was 26 years old at the time of his death he was laid to rest in a tomb on his private ranch in round oak georgia 23 miles 37 km north of macon after death sittin on the dock of the bay was recorded only three days prior to redding s death it was released the next month and became his first 1 single and first million seller the fact that sittin on the dock of the bay ultimately became redding s greatest commercial success was unexpected not only because its release came after his death but also because the song is actually a significant stylistic departure from the bulk of his other work a few further records were posthumously released including hard to handle 1968 drummer mickey jones has related a meeting between redding and bob dylan in which dylan played his new song just like a woman for redding according to jones redding was very impressed and told dylan that he would record the song as soon as he could however redding was killed before he could accomplish this redding s sons dexter and otis iii together with cousin mark locket founded the funk disco band the reddings in 1978 in 1999 redding posthumous received the grammy lifetime achievement award in 2002 the city of macon honored its native son unveiling a memorial statue of redding in the city s gateway park in 2004 rolling stone magazine ranked him 21 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time a likeness of redding appears as an evil version of

 id=6322091 title pastern nonfiltered 1145 processed 1129 dbindex 1561159 the pastern is a part of the horse between the fetlock joint and the hoof it is the equivalent to the two largest bones found in the human finger anatomy and importance of the pastern the pastern consists of two bones the uppermost called the large pastern bone or proximal phalanx which is located just under the fetlock and the lower called the small pastern bone or middle phalanx located between the large pastern bone and the coffin bone also see equine forelimb anatomy the joint between these two bones is aptly called the pastern joint this joint has very limited movement but does help to disperse the concussive forces of the horse s step and also has some influence on the flexion or extension of the entire leg the length of the pastern is determined by the length of the first phalanx the short pastern bone is less a determinant because it is smaller at 2 inches in length and part of it is encased in the hoof the pastern is vital in shock absorption when the horse s front leg is grounded the elbow and knee are locked therefore the fetlock and pastern are responsible for all the absorption of concussive forces of a footfall together they effectively distribute it among both the bones of the leg and the tendons and ligaments matching angles shoulder the slope of the shoulder is often the same as the slope of the pastern however differing angles in these two joints will not effect athletic performance hoof the pastern angle should always match the angle of the hoof after it is trimmed the angle will change as the hoof grows and may be off in a few weeks this keeps the bones of the pastern the coffin bone and their joints in proper alignment with a straight line running through their core an angle broken forward or back increases the stress on these bones joints tendons and ligaments if the angle does not match it is often an indication of poor farrier work conformation also see equine conformation the pastern is evaluated when a horse studied conformationally as it will effect the gait of the horse and the soundness of the joints above it traditionally the ideal pastern of the front leg has a 45 degree angle however this angle has been revised to a slightly steeper angle of 47 55 degrees as the traditional angle although it makes for comfortable riding greatly increases the chance of breakdown because there is less need for shock absorption in the hindleg its pasterns should be shorter and more upright than those of the front leg to increase its strength about 49 59 degrees and sometimes greater if the hind pasterns are the same angle as the front or too sloping in general then they are likely to break down during the horse s career especially if the horse in employed in strenuous work a nicely sloped pastern increases the likelihood of a long career it improves the animal s ability to travel on uneven terrain helps him withstand the rigors of a competition or race and makes the gait more comfortable for the rider the length of the pastern is also important the best length for the pastern is 1 2 to 3 4 the length of the cannon bone long sloping pasterns long sloping pasterns are more than 3 4 the length of the cannon bone they are sometimes bred for in a riding horse because they increase the shock absorption ability of the leg making the horse s gaits smoother and more comfortable for the rider however they have the distinct disadvantage of being weaker than more upright pasterns this is because many of the tendons and ligaments that go down the back of the leg continue under the back of the fetlock joint and attach to either the pastern bones or the coffin bone when the horse puts weight on his leg the fetlock sinks closer to the ground which is a needed response as it helps to absorb the shock of the footfall however when the pasterns are too long or sloping it does not support the fetlock enough and the fetlock may hyper extend possibly to the point where the ergot touches the ground this stresses the soft tissues that run under the fetlock because they are stretched longer if stretched too much they may tear or rupture medical problems that may result from long upright pasterns include bowed tendon sesamoiditis a fracture of the sesamoid bones found at the back of the fetlock should the joint hyperextend to the point where it touches the ground this is especially likely if the horse is tired such as at the end of a race injury to the suspensory ligament ringbone due to excessive stress on the the pastern joint long sloping pasterns are commonly seen in thoroughbreds saddlebreds short upright pasterns short upright pasterns are less than 1 2 the length of the cannon bone they are beneficial in that they decrease the chance that the horse will suffer from soft tissue injury however upright pasterns increase concussion by transmitting more of the shock of footfalls to the bones rather than the tendons this not only makes the gaits uncomfortable due to the jarring but also increases the chance of arthritis and may shorten the animal s career a short upright pastern also decreases the stride length of the gait which again makes the gait more uncomfortable and decreases the efficiency of the horse s movement since he must take more strides per meter than a longer strided horse medical problems that may be caused by short upright pasterns are usually a result of excess concussion they include ringbone sidebone splints bucked shins knee injuries that result from concussion including bucked knees navicular disease windpuffs short upright pasterns are often seen in draft horses this is because draft horses bred for pulling rather than riding and so they were not selected for smooth gaits of a saddle horse and because upright pasterns give more leverage to dig into the ground as the horse pulls a heavy load short upright pasterns are also commonly seen in quarter horses warmbloods and paint horses however riding horses are more likely to have problems with upright pasterns than draft horses because they tend to work at faster speeds due to the lack of shock absorption horses that have upright pasterns should be kept off hard surfaces whenever possible medical problems affecting the pastern ringbone arthritis of the pastern bones and joint

the 22nd century his main assignment appears to be advising earth s starfleet command attitude toward humans jonathan archer captain of the starship enterprise is not particularly fond of the ambassador as he appeared to play a major role in the vulcan discouragement of earth s deep space program he even went so far as to object to archer s command of the enterprise soval placed t pol on board the enterprise possibly to hinder what he viewed as the illogical humans but t pol became one of archer s most trusted officers soval continued his criticism of enterprises mission particularly after the crew along with a group of andorian commandos led by commander shran discovered a listening post beneath the vulcan sanctuary of p jem which was being used to spy on the andorians nevertheless soval reluctantly agreed to work with archer when they were both dispatched to mediate a dispute over a planetoid claimed by both the vulcans and andorians the situation was jeopardized early on when their shuttle was shot down while en route to meeting with shran fortunately archer was able to defend the ambassador and discover that andorian soldiers acting against shran s order were responsible after initial talks between soval and shran proved promising soval conceded that archer s service had been useful in the situation after the xindi attack on earth that killed seven million humans archer claimed that a mysterious figure from the future who was allied with the suliban had given him information on the rationale for the attack and more vitally the name of the alien race responsible for the attack the xindi soval was markedly skeptical of this claim and personally attempted to discourage enterprise from entering the delphic expanse the mysterious region of space the xindi call home soval came to appreciate archer s efforts in saving earth and his attitude toward humans warmed considerably after the man in charge of starfleet command admiral forrest sacrificed his own life to save the ambassador s during a bombing inside the earth embassy on vulcan see the episode entitled the forge for more it was subsequently revealed that soval in fact had developed a deep affinity and even affection for humans and that his earlier actions were more to protect them than to hinder them nonetheless after archer and his crew helped to prevent a war between vulcan and andoria and exposed corruption within the vulcan high command which was subsequently dissolved see kir shara soval agreed with the decision for vulcan to stop looking over earth s shoulder in space exploration matters soval represented vulcan at initial talks held in 2155 aimed at forging an alliance of worlds including earth vulcan andoria and the tellarite homeworld an organization that in 2161 would become the united federation of planets although soval had initially opposed jonathan archer s mission when archer gave a key speech at the start of the 2155 summit it was soval who led the applause afterwards soval s fate has yet to be chronicled he is not seen attending the 2161 inauguration of the ufp in the finale episode these are the voyages but that is not an indicator of his fate troubles with the vulcan high command soval is capable of conducting mind melds an act considered taboo amongst vulcans of the 22nd century in order to extract information about the bombing of earth s embassy on vulcan soval conducted a mind meld between himself and an ailing human maco security guard at the embassy who had witnessed the attack this mind meld is considered to be the first such between a vulcan and a human after the confession of his mind melding abilities soval was forced to resign from the vulcan high command he consequently joined the enterprise crew in an effort to prevent a vulcan preemptive strike based entirely on falsified information against andoria due in large part to his efforts a full scale vulcan andorian war never took place and the vulcan high command was swiftly overthrown for its part in attempting to start the war soval was subsequently reinstated as ambassador personality when first encountered soval was surprisingly emotional for a vulcan it was suggested in a couple of episodes that this was due to his long term exposure to humans and may be one of the reasons why he encouraged t pol to return to vulcan prior to the xindi mission the nature of soval s relationship with t pol is unclear it has been suggested that the two might be related in some way but nothing has been confirmed in canon speculation that he might be

 id=392431 title adjacency list nonfiltered 1200 processed 1182 dbindex 1561215 in graph theory an adjacency list is the representation of all edges or arcs in a graph as a list if the graph is undirected every entry is a set of two nodes containing the two ends of the corresponding edge if it is directed every entry is a tuple of two nodes one denoting the source node and the other denoting the destination node of the corresponding arc typically adjacency lists are unordered application in computer science in computer science an adjacency list is a closely related data structure for representing graphs in an adjacency list representation we keep for each vertex in the graph all other vertices which it has an edge to that vertex s adjacency list for instance the representation suggested by van rossum in which a hash table is used to associate each vertex with an array of adjacent vertices can be seen as an instance of this type of representation as can the representation in cormen et al in which an array indexed by vertex numbers points to a singly linked list of the neighbors of each vertex one difficulty with the adjacency list structure is that it has no obvious place to store data associated with the edges of a graph such as the lengths or costs of the edges to remedy this some algorithms texts such as that of goodrich and tamassia advocate a more object oriented variant of the adjacency list structure sometimes called an incidence list which stores for each vertex a list of objects representing the edges incident to that vertex to complete the structure each edge must point back to the two vertices forming its endpoints the extra edge objects in this version of the adjacency list cause it to use more memory than the version in which adjacent vertices are listed directly but are a convenient location to store additional information about each edge trade offs the main alternative to the adjacency list is the adjacency matrix for a graph with a sparse adjacency matrix an adjacency list representation of the graph occupies less space because it does not use any space to represent edges which are not present using a naive array implementation of adjacency lists on a 32 bit computer an adjacency list for an undirected graph requires about 8e bytes of storage where e is the number of edges each edge gives rise to entries in the two adjacency lists and uses four bytes in each on the other hand because each entry in an adjacency matrix requires only one bit they can be represented in a very compact way occupying only n2 8 bytes of contiguous space where n is the number of vertices besides just avoiding wasted space this compactness encourages locality of reference noting that a graph can have at most n2 edges allowing loops we can let d e n2 denote the density of the graph then 8e n2 8 or the adjacency list representation occupies more space precisely when d 1 64 thus a graph must be sparse indeed for reduced space to justify an adjacency list representation however this analysis is valid only when the representation is intended to store only the connectivity structure of the graph and not any numerical information about its edges besides the space tradeoff the different data structures also facilitate different operations it s easy to find all vertices adjacent to a given vertex in an adjacency list representation you simply read its adjacency list with an adjacency matrix you must instead scan over an entire row taking o n time if you instead want to know if two given vertices have an edge between them this can be determined at once with an adjacency matrix while requiring time proportional to the minimum degree of the vertices with the adjacency list references endofarticle doc doc

 id=1347823 title list of wild foods nonfiltered 1205 processed 1187 dbindex 1561221 since prehistoric times humans have hunted wild animals and gathered wild plants after the invention of agriculture and herding more and more of the human race has switched to obtaining food from domesticated crops and animals even marine fishes are now commonly aquacultured rather wild fished today most inhabitants of developed nations eat almost entirely domesticated foods nevertheless some wild foods are still popular this article lists wild foods that are either traditional or still popular today the list is biased towards temperate climates warning extreme danger it is important to carefully identify the plant before use there are many poisonous plants and mushrooms that are very similar to edible species many guide books should be used and someone with a great degree of skill should be asked to confirm a species if one tries to eat a wild plant or mushroom it is a good idea to start with only a very small amount first and wait a few hours or even a few days some people may be allergic to a certain plant and it should be tested first in small amounts its great to enjoy wild edibles but please be very careful wild meats mammals and birds game wild animals taken in hunting are often eaten their meat is collectively called game in some countries wild game meat can be bought in grocery stores in others for example the usa you can purchase a government issued hunting license and kill the animal yourself with a firearm or bow seafood wild fish mollusks etc most wild populations of fish have been damaged by overfishing or pollution so many species are now being domesticated and grown artificially aquaculture this is not necessarily good for the environment as fish farms often cause pollution themselves most countries now strictly regulate fishing methods seasons and catch amounts in an attempt to keep fishing of the remaining wild species within sustainable limits some species commonly harvested commercially from wild stocks are cod crab lobster octopus oyster may be gathered from wild populations or tended beds salmon often released from hatcheries into the wild as young fish then caught when mature snail and many other too numerous to list in some countries particularly in asia many species of seaweed algae are eaten kelp kombu in japanese laver nori in japanese freshwater fish pickerel bass goldeye jackfish sunfish wild plants fruits wild gathered fruit may find its way into commerce this is quite common in scandinavia and finland where the law allows the public to gather berries from both public and private lands some fruits are almost entirely obtained from wild plants bilberry buffaloberry cowberry cloudberry lingonberry mayapple pawpaw juneberry juniper berry elderberry huckleberry saskatoons other kinds of fruit are usually cultivated for commerce but their wild ancestors and relatives are gathered in a small way blackberry black raspberry barberry blueberry crabapple damson raspberry canada grape persimmon plum canada plum high bush cranberry mountain cranberry oregon grape sallal berry salmonberry strawberry fruits which are gathered from the wild and rarely if ever cultivated are elderberry rosehip sloe pitaya cloudberry bake apple nuts acorn used to make ersatz coffee during wartime beech brazil nut allegedly

flower syrups rose black locust berry syrups greens wild greens are not commonly gathered today except in a very few areas although nearly one thousand species of plants with edible leaves are known the collection of wild greens can be a very enjoyable hobby if time and care are taken be sure to consult books with adequate descriptions of the plants themselves and how to gather and prepare them common names vary from one location to another some plants such as nettles are tasty but care must be taken to avoid being stung other plants such as milkweed are thought to be poisonous raw and to only be edible after boiling in 4 5 changes of water although this appears to vary from region to region still other plants like wood sorrel are fine to eat raw but not recommended in large quantities because of the oxalic acid content some children have been known to prefer wild greens goosefoot sorrel etc to commercial leaf vegetables other wild greens burdock used mainly for the edible root cattails miner s lettuce dandelion goosefoot lamb s quarters nettle purslane plantain seakale sorrel wild leek pokeweed balsam milkweed pods oxeye daisy spruce tips mushrooms mushroom hunting is a popular hobby in many parts of the world the majority of mushrooms in commerce are farmed but wild collection continues because some of the most valued kinds e g the truffles tuber spp are mycorrhizal species that are difficult to cultivate mushroom hunting has a high risk of poisoning when attempted without careful identification and expertise since many deadly poisonous mushrooms closely resemble edible species and occur in the same habitats some edible species commonly harvested from wild areas are chicken of the woods black truffles white truffles morel oyster mushroom field mushroom

its defense bowie impressed with neill s leadership wrote no other man in the army could have kept men at this post under the neglect they have experienced despite houston s orders to have the alamo destroyed as indefensible neill and bowie vowed we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy however neill was soon badly in need of supplies as well as soldiers in late december

 id=2899597 title history of agriculture nonfiltered 1210 processed 1192 dbindex 1561226 agriculture has existed for more than 10 000 years origins of agriculture when major climate change took place after the last ice age c 11 000 bc much of the earth became subject to long dry seasons these conditions favoured annual plants which die off in the long dry season leaving a dormant seed or tuber these plants tended to put more energy into producing seeds than into woody growth an abundance of readily storable wild grains and pulses enabled hunter gatherers in some areas to form the first settled villages at this time the practice of agriculture first began around 8000 bc in the fertile crescent of mesopotamia part of present day iraq turkey syria and jordan which was then greener this region was home to the greatest diversity of annual plants and according to one study 32 of the 56 largest grass seeds the first crops to be domesticated were all crops of edible seeds wheat barley peas lentils chickpeas bitter vetch and flax these plants were all readily storable easy to grow and grew quickly they had to undergo few genetic changes to be of use to farmers their wild relatives remaining easily recognisable to this day crop domestication took place independently in geographically distant human populations in china rice and millet were domesticated by 7500 bc followed by the beans mung soy and azuki in the sahel region of africa local rice and sorghum were domestic by 5000 bc local crops were domesticated independently in west africa and possibly in new guinea and ethiopia three regions of the americas independently domesticated corn squashes potato and sunflowers humans in many different areas of the earth took up farming in what is set against the 500 000 year age span of modern humans a very short time this is the most convincing evidence that global climate change and the resultant adaptations by vegetation were the cause of the beginning of agriculture ancient agriculture agriculture is believed to have been developed at multiple times in multiple areas the earliest of which seems to have been in southwest asia pinpointing the absolute beginnings of agriculture is problematic because the transition away from purely hunter gatherer societies in some areas began many thousands of years before the invention of writing nonetheless archaeobotanists paleoethnobotanists have traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics such as a semi tough rachis and larger seeds to just after the younger dryas about 9 500 bc in the early holocene in the levant region of the fertile crescent there is much earlier evidence for use of wild cereals anthropological and archaeological evidence from sites across southwest asia and north africa indicate use of wild grain e g from the ca 20 000 bc site of ohalo ii in israel many natufian sites in the levant and from sites along the nile in the 10th millennium bc there is even early evidence for planned cultivation and trait selection grains of rye with domestic traits have been recovered from epi palaeolithic 10 000 bc contexts at abu hureyra in syria but this appears to be a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye rather than a definitive step towards domestication it isn t until after 9 500 bc that the eight so called founder crops of agriculture appear first emmer and einkorn wheat then hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax these eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on ppnb sites in the levant although the consensus is that wheat was the first to be sown and harvested on a significant scale by 7000 bc sowing and harvesting reached mesopotamia and there in the super fertile soil just north of the persian gulf sumerian ingenuity systematized it and scaled it up by 6000 bc farming was entrenched on the banks of the nile river about this time agriculture was developed independently in the far east probably in china with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop maize was first domesticated probably from teosinte in the americas around 3000 2700 bc though there is some archaeological evidence of a much older development the potato the tomato the pepper squash several varieties of bean and several other plants were also developed in the new world as was quite extensive terracing of steep hillsides in much of andean south america agriculture was also independently developed on the island of new guinea the reasons for the development of farming may have included climate change but possibly there were also social reasons e g accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift giving as in the pacific northwest potlatch culture most certainly there was a gradual transition from hunter gatherer to agricultural economies after a lengthy period during which some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered in the wild although localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the levant the fact that farming was invented at least three times elsewhere and possibly more suggests that social reasons may have been instrumental full dependency on domestic crops and animals did not occur until the bronze age by which time wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the usual diet if the operative definition of agriculture includes large scale intensive cultivation of land mono cropping organized irrigation and use of a specialized labour force the title inventors of agriculture would fall to the sumerians starting ca 5 500 bc intensive farming allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product for off season use or to sell barter the ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of standing armies sumerian agriculture supported a substantial territorial expansion together with much internecine conflict between cities making them the first empire builders not long after the egyptians powered by farming in the fertile nile valley achieved a population density from which enough warriors could be drawn for a territorial expansion more than tripling the sumerian empire in area sumerian agriculture in sumer barley was the main crop but wheat flax dates apples plums and grapes were grown as well mesopotamia was blessed with flooding from the tigris and euphrates rivers but floods came in late spring or early summer from snow melting from the turkish mountains with salt deposits under the soil all of this made mesopotamia very hard to farm the earliest known sheep and goats were also domesticated and were in a much large quantity than cattle sheep were mainly kept for meat and milk and butter and cheese were made from it ur a large town that covered about 50 acres 20 hectares had 10 000 animals kept in sheepfolds and stables and 3 000 slaughtered every year the city s population of 6 000 included a labour force of 2 500 cultivated 3 000 acres of land the labour force contained storehouse recorders work foremen overseers and harvest supervisors to supplement labourers agricultural produce was given to temple personnel important people in the community and small farmers the land was plowed by teams of oxen pulling light unwheeled plows and grain was harvested with sickles in the spring wagons had solid wheels covered by leather tires kept in position by copper nails and were drawn by oxen and the syrian onager now extinct animals were harnessed by collars yokes and headstalls they were controlled by reins and a ring through the nose or upper lip and a strap under the jaw as many as four animals could pull a wagon at one time though some hypothises hold that domestication of the horse occured as early as 4000 bc in the ukraine the horse was definitely in use by the sumerians around 2000 bc aztec and maya agriculture further information agriculture in mesoamerica the aztecs were some of the most innovative farmers of the ancient world and farming provided the entire basis of their economy the land around lake texcoco was fertile but not large enough to produce the amount of food needed for the population of their expanding empire the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides and fertilized their soil however their greatest agricultural technique was the chinampa or artificial islands also known as floating gardens these were used to make the swampy areas around the lake suitable for farming to make chinampas canals were dug through the marshy islands and shores then mud was heaped on huge mats made of woven reeds the mats were anchored by tying them to posts driven into the lake bed and then planting trees at their corners that took root and secured the artificial islands permanently the aztecs grew corn squash vegetables and flowers on chinampas roman agriculture roman agriculture built off techniques pioneered by the sumerians with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export romans laid the groundwork for the manorial economic system involving serfdom which flourished in the middle ages agriculture in the middle ages serfdom became widespread in europe in the middle ages the middle ages owe much of its development to advances made in islamic areas which flourished culturally and materially while europe and other roman and byzantine administered lands entered an extended period of social and economic stagnation as early as the ninth century an essentially modern agricultural system became central to economic life and organization in the arab caliphates replacing the largely export driven roman model the great cities of the near east north africa and moorish spain were supported by elaborate agricultural systems which included extensive irrigation based on knowledge of hydraulic and hydrostatic principles some of which were continued from roman times in later centuries persian muslims began to function as a conduit transmitting cultural elements including advanced agricultural techniques into turkic lands and western india the muslims introduced what was to become an agricultural revolution based on four key areas development of a sophisticated system of irrigation using machines such as norias newly invented water raising machines dams and reservoirs with such technology they managed to greatly expand the exploitable land area the adoption of a scientific approach to farming enabled them to improve farming techniques derived from the collection and collation of relevant information throughout the whole of the known world farming manuals were produced in every corner of the muslim world detailing where when and how to plant and grow various crops advanced scientific techniques allowed leaders like ibn al baytar to introduce new crops and breeds and strains of livestock into areas where they were previously unknown incentives based on a new approach to land ownership and labourers rights combining the recognition of private ownership and the rewarding of cultivators with a harvest share commensurate with their efforts their counterparts in europe struggled under a feudal system in which they were almost slaves serfs with little hope of improving their lot by hard work the introduction of new crops transforming private farming into a new global industry exported everywhere including europe where farming was mostly restricted to wheat strains obtained much earlier via central asia spain received what she in turn transmitted to the rest of europe many agricultural and fruit growing processes together with many new plants fruit and vegetables these new crops included sugar cane rice citrus fruit apricots cotton artichokes aubergines and saffron others previously known were further developed muslims also brought to that country lemons oranges cotton almonds figs and sub tropical crops such as bananas and sugar cane several were later exported from spanish coastal areas to the spanish colonies in the new world also transmitted via muslim influence a silk industry flourished flax was cultivated and linen exported and esparto grass which grew wild in the more arid parts was collected and turned into various articles renaissance to industrial revolution the invention of a three field system of crop rotation during the middle ages and the importation of the chinese invented moldboard plow vastly improved agricultural efficiency after 1492 the world s agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the columbian exchange crops and animals that were previously only known in the old world were now transplanted to the new and vice versa perhaps most notably the tomato became a favorite in european cuisine and maize and potatoes were widely adopted other transplanted crops include pineapple coffee cocoa and tobacco in the other direction several wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native north central and south americans agriculture was a key element in the atlantic slave trade triangular trade and the expansion by european powers into the americas in the expanding plantation economy large plantations producing crops including sugar cotton and indigo were heavily dependent upon slave labor by the early 1800s agricultural practices particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages and before especially in the largely virgin soils of north and south america the 18th and 19th century also saw the development of glasshouses or greenhouses initially for the protection and cultivation of exotic plants imported to europe and north america from the tropics experiments on plant hybridization in the late 1800s yielded advances in the understanding of plant genetics and subsequently the development of hybrid crops increasing dependence upon monoculture crops lead to famines and food shortages most notably the irish potato famine 1845 1849 recent history new technologies with the rapid rise of mechanization in the late 19th and 20th centuries particularly in the form of the tractor farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible these advances joined to science driven innovations in methods and resources have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the united states argentina israel germany and a few other nations to output volumes of high quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit the development of rail and highway networks and the increasing use of container shipping and refrigeration in developed nations have also been essential to the growth of mechanized agriculture allowing for the economical long distance shipping of produce while chemical fertilizer and pesticide have existed since the 19th century their use grew significantly in the early twentieth century in the 1960s the green revolution applied western advances in fertilizer and pesticide use to farms worldwide with varying success other applications of scientific research since 1950 in agriculture include gene manipulation and hydroponics new criticisms though the intensive farming practices pioneered and extended in recent history generally led to increased outputs they have also led to the destruction of farmland most notably in the dust bowl area of the united states following world war i as global population increases agriculture continues to replace natural ecosystems with monoculture crops a practice particularly damaging when slash and burn techniques are employed in the past few decades western consumers have become increasingly aware of and in some cases critical of widely used intensive agriculture practices contributing to a rise in popularity of organic farming and an ongoing discussion surrounding the potential for sustainable agriculture agricultural revolutions british agricultural revolution green revolution neolithic revolution endofarticle doc doc

god and fellow man history colegio san josé is situated on a hill overlooking metropolitan río piedras and san juan it stands in the site of an academy founded in l920 by bishop william jones the purpose of that school was to provide for the poor children of the area with the aim of fostering priestly and religious vocations the good bishop died without seeing his dream become a reality it turned out to be one of the most expensive schools in puerto rico under the direction of a capuchin priest padre antonio del castillo and the principalship of mr george keelan the school officially opened on september 6 1920 as academia san agustín sama the ensuing years were such troubled ones that bishop jorge caruana contemplated selling the property to an american corporation to build a hotel at the site however the bishop decided to give it one more try and in 1924 he invited the trinitarians with father thomas judge s t to take over the administration of san agustín the school became a center of higher education because of a disastrous hurricane san ciprián 1932 followed by years of financial reverses the trinitarians were forced to withdraw in 1938 bishop edwin byrne invited the marianists under the leadership of father joseph tetzlaff s m and brother adolf eiben s m to assume responsibility for the school the diocese of san juan absorbed the debt of the defunct academy and the name was changed to colegio san josé the society of mary marianists sent eight religious to join the lay staff of the colegio which at that time had an enrollment of 140 students

pottenger sanatorium for treatment of tuberculosis in monrovia california he completed his residency at los angeles county hospital in 1930 he became a full time assistant at the sanatorium from 1932 to 1942 he also conducted what became known as the pottenger cat study in 1940 he founded the francis m pottenger jr hospital at monrovia until closing in 1960 the hospital specialized in treating non tubercular diseases of the lung especially asthma he served as president of several professional organizations including the los angeles county medical association the american academy of applied nutrition and the american therapeutic society work one particular question that pottenger addressed in his study has to do with the nutritive value of heat labile elements nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods he applied the principles of nutrition and endocrinology early in his practice dr pottenger was a pioneer in using crude extracts of the adrenal cortex for allergic states and the syndrome of depletion in his treatment of respiratory diseases such as tb asthma allergies and emphysema he always highlighted proper diet based on the principles discovered by weston price at his sanitorium in monrovia california he served liberal amounts of liver butter cream and eggs to convalescing patients he also gave supplements of adrenal cortex to treat exhaustion pottenger s cats pottenger noticed a disproportionately high death rate among cats undergoing adrenalectomy these laboratory cats were being used to test the potency of a hormone in an adrenal extract he was making the adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments unfortunately most of the cats died during the operation dr pottenger was feeding these cats the most nutritive diet he could according to the experts of his day the diet consisted of raw milk cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver tripe sweetbread brains heart and muscle when the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available dr pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from the local meat packing plant including organs meat and bone and fed a separate group of cats from this supply within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group their kittens were more energetic and most interestingly their post operative death rate was much lower at a certain point he decided to begin a controlled scientific study the pottenger cats study lasted for ten years with three generations of cats being studied approximately 900 cats were involved this study was specifically designed to show the difference between eating raw foods versus cooked and processed foods over a long period of time the experiment in which one group of cats received only raw milk and raw meat while other groups received part of the diet as pasteurized milk or cooked meat can be summarized as follows adequate diet a 1 3 raw milk cod liver oil and 2 3 raw meat defficient diet b 1 3 raw meat cod liver oil and 2 3 pasteurized milk defficient diet c 1 3 raw meat cod liver oil and 2 3 evaporated milk defficient diet d 1 3 raw meat cod liver oil and 2 3 sweetened condensed milk defficient diet e raw metabolized vitamin d milk only effects on cats the cats eating only raw food were disease free and healthy generation after generation after generation the cats eating the cooked and processed foods had all kinds of problems by the end of the first generation the cats started to develop degenerative diseases and became quite lazy by the end of the second generation the cats had developed degenerative diseases by mid life and started losing their coordination by the end of the third generation the cats had developed degenerative diseases very early in life and some were born blind and weak and had a much shorter life span many of the third generation cats couldn t even produce offspring there was an abundance of parasites and vermin while skin diseases and allergies increased from an incidence of five percent in normal cats to over 90 percent in the third generation of deficient cats kittens of the third generation did not survive six months bones became soft and pliable and the cats suffered from adverse personality changes males became docile while females became more aggressive the cats suffered from most of the degenerative diseases encountered in human medicine and died out totally by the fourth generation his conclusions were that a diet consisting exclusively of raw milk and raw meat was the only adequate intake which insured the maintenance of optimal health for the cats cats on the all raw diet showed good bone structure with wide palates and plenty of space for the teeth as well as excellent bone density shiny fur and lack of parasites and disease they reproduced with ease and were gentle and easy to handle cooking the meat or substituting heat processed milks for raw resulted in heterogeneous reproduction and physical degeneration that escalated with each successive generation the changes in facial structure and beginning of degenerative diseases that dr pottenger observed in cats on deficient diets

 id=2282465 title list of grand dukes of russia nonfiltered 1256 processed 1238 dbindex 1561272 this is a list of those members of the russian imperial family who bore the title velikiy knjaz usually translated into english as grand duke but more accurately grand prince this courtesy title was borne by the sons and male line grandsons of the emperors of russia along with the style of his imperial highness they were not sovereigns but members and dynasts of the house of the reigning emperor for those grand dukes who were rulers of russia see list of russian rulers the title grand prince is the english translation of the russian the slavic knyaz and the baltic kunigaitis both nowadays usually translated as prince is actually a cognate of king thus a sovereign veliki knjaz was more like high king than grand duke the title grand prince originated from 9th century when rulers of kievan rus were so styled in later medieval russian states the rus it already was used simultaneously by several rulers in the more expanded rurikid dynasty and additionally by rulers of neighboring lithuania gediminid dynasty the title velikiy knyaz continued as a courtesy title for all or several members of the dynasty such as the grand duke of russia velikiy knjaz that belonged to members of the family of the russian tsar in russia s imperial era from the 17th century although these grand princes were not sovereigns for those grand dukes who were rulers of russia see list of russian rulers bearing the title velikiy kniaz originally had no specific rules it traditionally belonged to all dynasts and additionally dynasts were created by the act of granting the title to some other heirs until the 19th century the russian imperial house was usually in a precarious situation having often no more than a couple of male dynasts if even that many the number to use the title was thus not abundant empress elisabeth of russia after all male line descent had been exhausted made her sister s son the future peter iii of russia a dynast and a grand duke although he was not of male line descent after the births of the numerous sons of nicholas i of russia the number of grand dukes increased into higher orders of magnitude this afforded russia a respite from earlier fragility that had plagued russian succession having led even as itself the country to instability the right to the title was not traditionally limited and in 1880 s when there existed well over twenty male dynasts alexander iii of russia felt that their high number if all allowed to use grand duke diminishes the prestige of the imperial house and the weight of the title itself alexander iii formalized the use of titles in the imperial house in 1886 on 2 july 1886 julian calendar 14 july 1886 gregorian by such amendment to the succession laws grand duke belonged henceforward only to sons and paternal grandsons of the emperors of russia and grand duchess correspondingly only to daughters and granddaughters as well as to legitimate wives of grand dukes one male infant already 9 days old at the time of alexander s edict thus lost the title those russian dynasts who genealogically were distant from emperors as not to be grand dukes were entitled to titulary prince of russia ioann konstantinovich of russia 1886 1918 was apparently the only who lost the grand ducal title accorded by convention at birth but removed by alexander iii alexander iii s own grandchildren children of his daughter xenia alexandrovna were not yet born at the time of the edict and accordingly became only princes of russia from their births as they were great grandchildren of nicholas i one generation too far when looking at the male lineage the numbers began to decrease for other reasons too in the last three decades before the revolution only a couple of boys were born who were entitled to grand ducal title after the revolution particularly morganatic marriages axed numbers of dynasts to increasingly low numbers alexander iii s edict has led to the situation where there is no longer any descendant to be uncontestedly entitled to grand ducal title great prince or grand prince would be a more accurate translation of this russian title but that term is neither standard nor widely used in english nor in french in german however a russian grand duke was known as a großfürst and in latin as magnus princeps grand duke is the traditional translation of the title velikiy kniaz in languages which do not have different words for prince as a substantive title and prince as a courtesy title english and french are such languages grand dukes of russia of the house of romanov holstein gottorp table amazingly enough after 1918 no such boy was born into the deposed imperial house who would have been entitled to the title grand duke i e had been a male line grandson of a reigning emperor although such would have been technically possible as there lived sons of reigning emperors and their sons would have been so entitled fictional grand dukes of russia a grand duke leonid of russia appears in the lucky luke comic book le grand duc first published in 1973 by morris and rené goscinny a grand duke alexei of russia appears in the sherlock holmes short story the adventure of the seven clocks by adrian conan doyle and john dickson carr about the grand duke of russia in translated contexts the title of sovereign grand duke and it as translation of velikiy knjaz have clearly different meanings this occurs particularly in languages which do not have different words for prince 1 signifying the non ruling relatives of a monarch i e as a courtesy title and 2 prince signifying a monarch sovereign or like i e as a substantive title because there grand duke usually is 1 the established translation of the post medieval courtesy title velikiy knjaz literally grand prince and they are not sovereigns but 2 several other post medieval grand dukes are being typically rulers of small states such as luxembourg english and french use the title grand duke for both these purposes in translations and such texts 2 grand duke of russia may also refer to some or all of the medieval reigning grand princes of the kievan rus and its successor states grand duke is the usual and established translation in english and french of the russian courtesy title velikiy knjaz grand prince of russia which from 17th century belonged to members of the family of the russian tsar although those grand dukes were not sovereigns note that a grand duke or grand duchess as a translation is thus not necessarily associated with a grand duchy see the relevant articles for more information these post medieval russian grand dukes are not associated with a grand duchy any other translation of velikiy knjaz of russia than grand duke is neither standard nor widely used in english nor in french in german however a russian grand duke is known as a großfürst and in latin as magnus princeps a russian grand duke

three he was discovered by john flaxman who was visiting seated on his mother s knee drawing with much gravity the sculptor admired his sketch adding do not let him be cramped with lessons in drawing let his genius follow its own bent he will astonish the world advice which was followed a mail coach done when he was six years old is already full of surprising vigour and variety in its galloping horses leech was educated at charterhouse school where william makepeace thackeray his lifelong friend was a fellow pupil and at sixteen he began to study for the medical profession at st bartholomew s hospital where he won praise for the accuracy and beauty of his anatomical drawings he was then placed under a mr whittle an eccentric practitioner the original of rawkins in albert smith s adventures of mr ledbury and afterwards under dr john cockle but gradually he drifted into the artistic profession artistic career he was eighteen when his first designs were published a quarto of four pages entitled etchings and sketchings by a pen esq comic character studies from the london streets then he drew some political lithographs did rough sketches for bell s life produced a popular parody on mulready s postal envelope and on the death of seymour applied unsuccessfully to illustrate the pickwick papers in 1840 leech began his contributions to the magazines with a series of etchings in bentley s miscellany where george cruikshank had published his plates to jack sheppard and oliver twist and was illustrating guy fawkes in feebler fashion in company with the elder master leech designed for the ingoldsby legends and stanley thorn and until 1847 produced many independent series of etchings these were not his best work their technique is imperfect and we never feel that they express the artist s individuality the richard savage plates for instance being strongly reminiscent of cruikshank and the dance at stamford hall of hablot browne in 1845 leech illustrated st giles and st james in douglas william jerrold s new shilling magazine with plates more vigorous and accomplished than those in bentley but it is in subjects of a somewhat later date and especially in those lightly etched and meant to be printed with colour that we see the artist s best powers with the needle and acid among such of his designs are four charming plates to charles dickens s a christmas carol 1844 the broadly humorous etchings in the comic history of england 1847 1848 and the still finer illustrations to the comic history of rome 1852 which last particularly in its minor woodcuts shows some exquisitely graceful touches as witness the fair faces that rise from the surging water in cloelia and her companions escaping from the etruscan camp among the other etchings which deserve very special reference are those in young master troublesome or master jacky s holidays and the frontispiece to hints on life or how to rise in society 1845 a series of minute subjects linked gracefully together by coils of smoke illustrating the various ranks and conditions of men one of them the doctor by his patient s bedside almost equalling in vivacity and precision the best of cruikshank s similar scenes then in the 1850s come the numerous etchings of sporting scenes contributed together with woodcuts to the handley cross novels lithographic work turning to leech s lithographic work we have in 1841 the portraits of the children of the mobility an important series dealing with the humorous and pathetic aspects of london street arabs which were afterwards so often and so effectively to employ the artist s pencil amid all the squalor which they depict they are full of individual beauties in the delicate or touching expression of a face in the graceful turn of a limb the book is scarce in its original form but in 1875 two reproductions of the outline sketches for the designs were published a lithographic issue of the whole series and a finer photographic transcript of six of the subjects which is more valuable than even the finished illustrations of 1841 in which the added light and shade is frequently spotty and ineffective arid the lining itself has not the freedom which we find in some of leech s other lithographs notably in the fly leaves published at the punch office and in the inimitable subject of the nuptial couch of the caudles which also appeared in woodcut form as a political cartoon with mrs caudle personated by brougham disturbing by untimely loquacity the slumbers of the lord chancellor whose haggard cheek rests on the woolsack for pillow wood engraving it was in work for the wood engravers that leech was most prolific and individual among the earlier of such designs are the illustrations to the comic english and latin grammars 1840 to written caricatures 1841 to hood s comic annual 1842 and to albert smith s wassail bowl 1843 subjects mainly of a small vignette size transcribed with the best skill of such woodcutters as orrin smith and not like the larger and later punch illustrations cut at speed by several engravers working at once on the subdivided block it was in 1841 that leech s connection with punch began a connexion which subsisted until his death and resulted in the production of the best known and most admirable of his designs his first contribution appeared in the issue of august 7 a full page illustration entitled foreign affairs of character studies from the neighbourhood of leicester square his cartoons deal at first mainly with social subjects and are rough and imperfect in execution but gradually their method gains in power and their subjects become more distinctly political and by 1849 the artist is strong enough to produce the splendidly humorous national personification which appears in disraeli measuring the british lion about 1845 we have the first of that long series of half page and quarter page pictures of life and manners executed with a hand as gentle as it was skilful containing as ruskin has said admittedly the finest definition and natural history of the classes of our society the kindest and subtlest analysis of its foibles the tenderest flattery of its pretty and well bred ways which has yet appeared in addition to his work for the weekly issue of punch leech contributed largely to the punch almanacks and pocket books to once a week from 1859 until 1862 to the illustrated london news where some of his largest and best sporting scenes appeared and to innumerable novels and miscellaneous volumes besides of which it is only necessary to specify a little tour in ireland 1859 which is noticeable as showing the artist s treatment of pure landscape though it also contains some of his daintiest figurepieces like that of the wind blown girl standing on the summit of a pedestal with the swifts darting around her and the breadth of sea beyond public exhibition in 1862 leech appealed to the public with a very successful exhibition of some of the most remarkable of his punch drawings these were enlarged by a mechanical process and coloured in oils by the artist himself with the assistance and under the direction of his friend john everett millais millais had earlier painted a portrait of a child reading leech s comic book mr briggs sporting tour character leech was a rapid and indefatigable worker dean hole claims to have produce three finished drawings on the wood designed traced and rectified without much effort as it seemed between breakfast and dinner the best technical qualities of leech s art his precision and vivacity in the use of the line are seen most clearly in the first sketches for his woodcuts and in the more finished drawings made on tracing paper from these first outlines before the chiaroscuro was added and the designs were transcribed by the engraver turning to the mental qualities of his art it would be a mistaken criticism which ranked him as a comic draughtsman like hogarth he was a true humorist a student of human life though he observed humanity mainly in its whimsical aspects hitting all he saw with shafts with gentle satire kin to charity that harmed nut the earnestness and gravity of moral purpose which is so constant a note in the work of hogarth is indeed far less characteristic of leech but there are touches of pathos and of tragedy in such of the punch designs as the poor man s friend 1845 and general février turned traitor 1855 and in the queen of the arena in the first volume of once a week which are sufficient to prove that more solemn powers for which his daily work afforded no scope lay dormant in their artist the purity and manliness of leech s own character are impressed on his art we find in it little of the exaggeration and grotesqueness and none of the fierce political enthusiasm of which the designs of james gillray are so full compared with that of his great contemporary george cruikshank his work is restricted both in compass of subject and in artistic dexterity see also john leech s pictures of life and character by thackeray quarterly review december 1854 letter by john ruskin arrows of the chace vol i p 161

in front of the building facing woodward avenue and the detroit public library across the street in 1949 the museum was among the first to return a work looted by the nazis when it returned claude monet s the seine at asnières to its rightful owner the art dealer they had purchased it from reimbursed the museum in 2002 the museum discovered that ludolf backhuysen s a man o war and other ships off the dutch coast a 17th century seascape painting under consideration for purchase by the museum had been looted from a private european collection by the nazis the museum contacted the original

included dia president ralph h booth william j gray architect albert kahn and industrialist edsel ford w r valentiner the museum director acted as art director and clyde h borroughs was the secretary

1927 later the murals by diego rivera were added to what had been a courtyard it was roofed over when the murals were executed and although widely held to be great works of art today this was not necessarily the case when they were done architect henry sheply a close friend of cret s would write unfortunately some years later the board of trustees in a misguided moment employed diego rivera the mexican artist to execute a series of murals on the walls of the garden these are harsh in color scale and composition they were designed without the slightest thought given to the delicate architecture and ornament they are quite simply a travesty in the name of art the building contained iron work by samuel yellin tile from the pewabic pottery works and architectural sculpture by leon

 id=165067 title watt steam engine nonfiltered 1305 processed 1286 dbindex 1561323 improving on the design of the 1711 newcomen engine the watt steam engine developed in 1765 was the next great step in the development of the steam engines offering a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency for what was a minor design change the new design was soon retrofitted to almost all existing newcomen engines and then went on to be used in place of most natural power sources such as wind and water james watt s design became synonymous with steam engines due in no small part to his partner matthew boulton introduction in 1698 the english mechanical designer thomas savery wrote out the designs for the world s first operational steam engine the newcomen engine was modeled on savery s designs thomas newcomen s design was both powerful and useful the first example from 1711 was able to replace a team of 500 horses that had powered a wheel to pump out a mine in over fifty years few detail changes had been made to the basic design seventy five of which could now be found at mines all over england however effective the system was it was also expensive to run it worked by creating a vacuum in a cylinder by condensing steam inside it this process was normally so slow that the engine was not very effective so to improve the condensation a small spray of water was introduced when the cylinder was filled with steam unfortunately the water also cooled the cylinder walls so when the next charge of steam was introduced it spent some time simply warming the cylinder back up to boiling temperatures condensing while this occurred separate condenser a scottish instrument maker james watt was given the job in 1763 of repairing a model newcomen engine for the university of glasgow and noted how inefficient it was in 1765 while wandering across glasgow green he conceived the idea of a separate condensing chamber for the steam engine watt s idea was to separate the condensation system from the cylinder injecting the cooling water spray in a second cylinder c attached to the main one through a valve v when the piston had reached the top of the cylinder the valve v was closed and v was opened external atmospheric pressure would then push the steam and piston towards the condenser thus the condenser could be kept cold and under less than atmospheric pressure while the cylinder remained hot matthew boulton watt met matthew boulton and became a member of the lunar society he told boulton about his ideas on improving the engine and boulton an avid entrepreneur agreed to fund development of a test engine at soho near birmingham this proved frustrating and watt repeatedly almost gave up on the project only to be convinced to continue by the ever cheery boulton the improvement due to this change was dramatic watt s design used about 75 less fuel than a similar newcomen engine since the changes were fairly limited boulton and watt licensed the idea to existing newcomen engine owners taking a share of the cost of fuel they saved watt was unwilling to rest on his laurels and continued to improve his designs throughout his life he realised that the new means of evacuating steam from the cylinder might quicken the operating engine cycle suppose low pressure steam could be substituted for atmospheric pressure if the top of the cylinder was closed off the steam could act upon the piston in the power stroke the steam pressure would not be able to move it in normal circumstances but it could if acting upon a vacuum this raised the possibility of reciprocal action an arrangement of valves could admit steam at either end or connect either end with the condenser consequently the direction of the power stroke might be reversed the resulting two strokes gave a very even movement of the beam later improvements he turned his attention to providing rotary power from his engines introducing the sun and planet gear system invented by his employee william murdoch and later adopting the more familiar crankshaft seen on most engines today this allowed the steam engine to be used to replace water wheels thereby freeing british industry from geographical constraints and becoming one of the main drivers in the industrial revolution in order to improve reliability he introduced further improvements the operation of the condensor was assisted by an air pump driven by an eccentric rod attached to the beam as the pace of the operation of the machine increased it needed to operate at a constant speed he employed a centrifugal governor earlier used in windmills to automatically control the pressure between the millstones automatically controlling steam flow to the engine and keeping it at a steady speed he also introduced the manometer to measure steam pressure within the engines which when connected to a linkage to the position of the piston and a pencil that recorded both could enable a record to be produced of the action of the machine throughout the cycle the indicator diagram the oldest working engine in the world is the smethwick engine brought into service in may 1779 and now at thinktank in birmingham formerly the birmingham museum of science industry the oldest still in its original engine house and still capable of doing the job for which it was installed is the 1812 boulton and watt engine at the crofton pumping station this was designed to pump water for the kennet and avon canal on certain weekends throughout the year the modern pumps are switched off and the two steam engines at crofton

personality was a slave to the one ring and would kill anyone who tried to take it critics at the time pointed out that this characterization is not faithful to the original work by j r r tolkien which merely ascribes conflicting motives to gollum it is samwise gamgee who refers to gollum s behavior with two names slinker and stinker while gollum consistently refers to himself as we in the books this is a matter of regional dialect and there are country people in england today who refer to themselves as we and us a slightly less stereotyped portrayal was essayed by french stewart in an

revealed niki once had a sister named jessica and that the trauma of her death also contributed in an episode of the usa network series psych 2006 the main character confronts a stereotypical multiple

making this a case of diachronic telepathy rather than straight ahead multiplicity yami appears as an older more confident version of yugi especially at the beginning yami is the strong somewhat short tempered protector and yugi the bewildered host apart from the stereotyped memory losses and conflicts at the beginning of the series the two communicate freely encourage one another and are able to overcome challenges by cooperating even co running both using the body at the same time one episode shows how they prevent a powerful opponent from reading their thoughts by mindshuffling deliberately

 id=6467468 title evacuation slide nonfiltered 1321 processed 1302 dbindex 1561339 an evacuation slide is an inflatable slide used to evacuate an aircraft quickly an escape slide is required on all commercial passenger carrying aircraft where the door sill height is such that in the event of an evacuation passengers would be unable to step down from the door uninjured escape slides are packed and held within the door structure inside the slide bustle a protruding part of the inside of an aircraft door that varies in size depending on both the size of the aircraft and the size of the door planes without slides airplanes such as the embraer 145 family and the bombardier crj family do not have escape slides because all exits are a safe distance from the ground on the primary entrance door 1l most of these aircraft have stairs that are either connected to the door or drop down window exits many airplanes have escape slides on the main doors of the plane but do not have slides over the wings due to the fact that when the flaps are fully lowered the wings are low enough to the ground that passengers can evacuate safely some of these aircraft are the embraer 190 boeing 707 717 727 and 737 however other aircraft require the use of overwing slides for the window exits to ensure passengers are able to reach the ground quickly and safely these include boeing 767 boeing 757 airbus a320 series aircraft typically overwing evacuation slides are not designed for use in ditching situations as they cannot be detached window exits usually come in two configurations an unhinged hatch type exit where the hatch is unlocked from the inside and pulled into the cabin whereupon it can be disposed some carriers recommend placing the hatch onto the adjacent seats while others may recommend dropping it in the next seat row or rotating the exit and throwing it outside the aircraft as far forward as possible a manual inflation handle for the evacuation slide if equipped can be found in the window frame most aircraft overwing exits are of this type a hinged self disposing exit hatch that opens automatically outward using a spring when the exit handle is pulled this exit design was designed in response to research generated after the manchester air disaster which indicated that unhinged hatch type exits were difficult to open by untrained passengers this design is currently found only on boeing 737 ng aircraft window exits are usually equipped with ditching or life lines these may be attached to the inside frame of the window exit or located in a nearby storage locker one end has a buckles to connect to attachments on the aircraft s wings history the first aircraft evacuation slide was developed and produced by air cruisers founded by james f boyle inventor of the wwii life vest the mae west prior to inflateables some passenger aircraft utilized canvas type slides which required the crew to undertake an extensive rigging procedure canvas type slides are still found on some russian aircraft types of slide there are two primary types of aircraft evacation slides slides and slide rafts a slide is for use only on land as a means of escape although it has sufficient buoyancy to allow passengers to hold on to a lanyard running the length of it and use it as a buoyancy aid a slide raft is an evacuation slide that can be used both as a means of escape in a land evacuation and also as a liferaft in a landing on water slide rafts ususally feature an erectable canopy outer compartments to hold passengers and survival packs containing items such as leak stoppers paddles and flares slide can also be single or dual lane depending on the width of the exit they are used at a dual lane slide being capable of evacuating a greater number of people in an evacuation slides and slide rafts can be detached from the girt bar usually by a two or three step procedures this may for example involve lifting up the flap on the girt bar and pulling the deatch handle these procedures are usually placarded red on the slide for ditching use only once the slide is separated the slide remains attached to the aircraft by a mooring line this line will break if the airframe submerges or can be disconnected with a pre supplied knife or disconnect handle a ramp slide is an evacuation slide that has a small platform between the exit and the slide itself and is used mainly where the proximity of the exit to an engine requires the slide to be angled away from the engine to prevent damage airbus a310 airbus 340 600 airbus a380 and boeing 747 aircraft have ramp slide attachments for their overwing evacuation slides the overwing exits on the airbus a320 series boeing 757 variant and boeing 767 variant aircraft also utilize ramp slide attachments another unique type of evacuation slide is found on certain dc 8 dc 9 md 80 and boeing 717 aircraft this type of slide is located in the aircraft s tailcone this slide deploys after the tailcone is jettisoned by flight attendants allowing for evacuation through the rear of the airframe the procedure to use this exit may involve removing a plug type pressure bulkhead or a swing type door that leads directly to a walkway at the end of the walkway is the slide pack and a manual tailcone jettison handle for use if the tailcone has not already been automatically jettisoned by opening the walkway entrance certain evacuation slides do not use a slide bustle on the door as a container instead the slide is fuselage mounted and is attached to a container located underneath or below the exit close to the aircraft exterior this design of slide is found in the airbus a321 aircraft at the emergency doors and typically at all overwing evacuation slides other than the boeing 747 400 series aircraft one of the newest development in evacuation slide technology can be found on the airbus a380 which was developed by goodrich aircraft interior products certain slides on board the aircraft have the tribrid inflation system which is connected to a sensing system within the door if the door is opened in emergency mode at an abnormal attitude e g nose up position due to the loss of landing gear the slide will inflate normally but will also inflate several feet of additional slide to ensure the slide reaches the ground this is compares differently to the boeing 747 as doors found on that aircraft have no such system should the slide not reach the ground the doors must be blocked to prevent passenger injury operation prior to departure usually before engine startup all the aircraft doors are places into the armed or automatic mode by the cabin crew methods of arming vary from aircraft to aircraft but ultimately what is involved is the girt bar a metal bar attached to the door end of the slide being physically attached to brackets either in or adjacent to the door sill on older aircraft such as the boeing 737 this is done physically by the cabin crew and on most other aircraft it involves pushing a lever on the door itself which arms the door internally if a rapid evacuation is required and the doors are opened while armed the opening of the door pulls the slide pack out of the bustle because the girt bar as physically attached to the aircraft floor due to the weight of both the door and the slide great effort is involved in pushing the door open sufficiently to free the slide from the bustle thus on larger aircraft a power assist function kicks in to aid the opening either electrically or from compressed gas once the slide is completely free it will fall under gravity and after travelling a certain distance a pin will be pulled from a squib containing compressed gas and the slide will inflate should this system fail the slide can be manually inflated by the cabin crew by pulling a manual inflation handle at the top of the slide should this also fail standard operating procedures require the cabin crew to send passengers away from the door and to one that has a functioning escape slide some russian built aircraft like the tupolev tu 154 have a very complicated process to activate and deploy the slides the slides are stored in cabinets usually beside the emergency exit inside the aircraft there are usually about the same width and height as a seat to activate the slide one must pull the front cover to a 90 degree angle the pull the slide out so its lying flat on the floor or door sill open the emergency exit and kick or push it out gravity will then pull the slide to the ground and it will inflate aircraft safety cards and in flight safety demonstrations show the passengers where the nearest emergency exits are and how to use the evacuation slides external links air cruisers producer of first evacuation slide goodrich another major

original fief of tokugawa iyeyasu who was the founder of the tokugawa sh gunate the feudal government that ruled japan from 1600 until the meiji restoration in 1868 language while the local mikawa dialect is considered to be generally indistinguishable from what is considered modern standard japanese there are very subtle and distinctive differences mikawa dialect has substantial differences when compared to the dialect of nagoya and western areas of aichi where the nagoya dialect also known as owari ben owari being the traditional name for the nagoya region is the traditional dialect cognitively mikawa ben and modern contemporary japanese are extremely close in part due to the influence of the tokugawa shogunate and accidents of history in recent decades the large number of people moving into okazaki and the surrounding cities particularly to work in the motor vehicle industry and the influence of mass media has had an impact on the local dialect with the result that more people are using standard japanese only in day to day life demographics as of may 1st 2006 the city government estimates the population at 368 201 the city remains young with 139 233 households 2 64 residents per household the population comprises 185 651 males and 182 550 females reflecting the number of young men who move to okazaki to work in the manufacturing sector this fast population growth reflects the low unemployment rate as well as affordable housing close to nagoya in april 2006 there were 263 births and 199 deaths for a natural increase of 64 people while for the same month 2 197 people moved into okazaki and 1 910 left for a net increase of 287 people overall density has fallen to 950 83 persons per km² following the annexation by okazaki of the neighboring town of

cities in japan i e t ky ky to saka etc okazaki nonetheless has a wide variety of historical sites museums and festivals that shouldn t be missed okazaki castle okazaki castle was originally built in 1455 by a warrior named saigo tsugiyori captured by the matsudaira family in 1524 and probably relocated from the other side of the river the castle remains associated with tokugawa iyeyasu even though the latter transferred to edo in 1590 during the edo period it served as the seat of the daimyo of the mikawa province and dominated the city until the new meiji government came into power which ordered obsolescent castle buildings demolished the main donjon was destroyed in order to earn foreign exchange from scrap metals in 1959 the donjon was reconstructed to its original style and specifications the walls are the same as those reconstructed in 1620 by lord honda fireworks aside from tokugawa iyeyasu okazaki is also well known and perhaps most famous for its fireworks the

 id=988751 title personal knowledge management nonfiltered 1357 processed 1338 dbindex 1561375 personal knowledge management pkm is a concept that has grown out of a combination of knowledge management km and personal information management pim and cognitive human abilities more particular the personal km is focused on helping an individual be more effective to work better while the focus is the individual the goal of the movement is to enable individuals to operate better in groups and in corporations as well this is as opposed to the traditional view of km which appears to be more centered on enabling the corporation to be more effective by recording and making available what its people know a core focus of pkm is personal inquiry a quest to find connect learn and explore pkm is a response to the idea that knowledge workers increasingly need to be responsible for their own growth and learning they need processes and tools by which they can evaluate what they know in a given situation and then seek out ways to fill the gaps when needed this frequently implies technology but one can be good at pkm without much in the way of special tools the nice thing about pkm is that the factor is taken care of immediately so you get quicker individual buy in the difficult thing is how do you show a traditional company that individual employee effectiveness necessarily leads to better organizational effectiveness pkm has recently been linked to social bookmarking blogging or k logs the idea is individuals use their blogs to capture ideas opinions or thoughts and this voicing will encourage cognitive diversity promote free exchanges away from a centralized policed knowledge repository that is additional to ordinary work some organizations are now introducing pkm systems with some or all of four components just in time canvassing templates and e mail canvassing lists that enable people looking for experts or expertise to identify and connect with the appropriate people quickly and effectively knowledge harvesting software tools that automatically collect appropriate knowledge residing on subject matter experts hard drives rather than waiting for it to be contributed to central repositories personal content management taxonomy processes and desktop search tools that enable employees to organize subscribe to publish and find information that resides on their own desktops personal productivity improvement knowledge fairs and one on one training sessions to help each employee make more effective personal use of the knowledge learning and technology resources available to them in the context of their own work pkm skills skills associated with personal knowledge management reflection continuous improvement on how the individual operates manage learning manage how and when the individual learns information literacy understanding what information is important and how to find unknown information organizational skills personal librarianship personal categorization and taxonomies networking with others knowing what your network of people knows knowing who might have additional knowledge and resources to help you researching canvassing paying attention interviewing and observational cultural anthropology skills communication skills perception intuition expression visualization and interpreting creative skills imagination pattern recognition appreciation innovation inference understanding of complex adaptive systems collaboration skills coordination synchronization experimentation cooperation and design criticisms of pkm not everyone agrees that the focus on the individual is a good thing or that pkm is anything more than a new wrapper around personal information management pim most notably some argue that knowledge is never an individual product that it emerges through connections dialog and social interaction see sociology of knowledge pkm has been associated with a focus on personal branding responsibility for personal learning personal networking using networking engines ryze friendster linkedin and management of individual documents thought and writings these activities do not illustrate the rich reach of the concept pkm software personalbrain desktop wikis mindmanager e mail calendar task managers weblogs with a web feed wiki semantic wiki weblogs with rss and wikis are

 id=7222823 title regeneration doctor who nonfiltered 1369 processed 1350 dbindex 1561387 regeneration in the fictional context of the long running british science fiction television series doctor who is a biological ability exhibited by the time lords a race of humanoids originating on the planet gallifrey this process allows a time lord who has become too old or mortally wounded to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality the main character of the programme the doctor is a time lord and has undergone this process several times over the course of the series run conceptual history the role of the doctor had been played by william hartnell since the programme s inception in 1963 however by 1966 it was increasingly apparent that hartnell s health was deteriorating and he was becoming more difficult to work with by the time the second story of season 4 the tenth planet was greenlighted the decision had been made to replace hartnell script editor gerry davis proposed that since the doctor had already been established as an alien that the character could die and return in a new body producer innes lloyd further suggested that the doctor could do this renewal regularly transforming from an older man to a younger one this would allow for the convenient recasting of the role when necessary at the conclusion of the tenth planet the first doctor collapses from apparent old age and exhaustion having commented earlier that his body was wearing a bit thin then before the eyes of his companions ben and polly and the viewing audience his features shift into that of the second doctor played by patrick troughton however on screen the process was not called regeneration but a renewal in the power of the daleks the second doctor s first story the doctor draws an analogy between the renewal and a caterpillar turning into a butterfly despite troughton s characterisation of the doctor differing from that of hartnell s the term renewal gave rise to an impression that the second doctor was just a younger version of the first rather than a separate incarnation with a radically different personality as later incarnations of the doctor were expected to be this impression lasted at least into 1982 as lawrence miles and tat wood point out in their about time reference series the officially licensed magazine doctor who monthly stated in a matrix data bank column that year that its readers should not confuse the regenerations of later incarnations with the rejuvenation of hartnell into troughton it was also not clear initially whether the renewal was a natural ability of the doctor s as opposed to a process initiated by technology in power the doctor describes his renewal as a function of his tardis time machine stating that without it couldn t survive when troughton left the series in 1969 the doctor was renewed again but this time it was forced on him by the time lords at the conclusion of the war games where it is referred to as a change of appearance once again this suggested that it was a superficial physical change not one of personality although jon pertwee s portrayal of the third doctor also differed quite substantially from troughton s in addition this change is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process the second doctor protests you can t just change what i look like without consulting me it was only at the end of the third doctor s era in planet of the spiders 1974 when pertwee s doctor turns into tom baker s fourth doctor that the change is finally called regeneration and is explained as a biological process that occurred when a time lord s body was dying it is also stated that following the regeneration the doctor s brain cells would be shaken up and his behaviour would be erratic for a time something that would be true for most subsequent regenerations as the series continued more aspects of the regenerative process were introduced but the basic concepts of regeneration as accepted by fans of the series today were only firmly established in the final scene of planet of the spiders this notwithstanding it is now generally accepted by fans from an in universe perspective that the renewal of the first doctor into the second and the change of appearance of the second doctor into the third were both part of the same process of regeneration transitions the regeneration effect was accomplished during the series original run from 1963 1989 primarily through the use of video mixing originally the plan was to have hartnell collapse at the end of the tenth planet with his cloak over his face which would then be pulled back to reveal troughton in the next serial however vision mixer shirley coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed hartnell s image to be overexposed to the point of almost whiting out the screen then fading back in to reveal troughton s face this also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of the tenth planet and troughton was accordingly signed up to participate subsequent regenerations retained essentially the same method with or without additional video or make up effects the transition from the fourth to the fifth doctor used an additional make up effect representing a transitional form known as the watcher but aside from this other regenerations in the original series run simply mixed the image of the incoming actor on top of the outgoing one the transition from the seventh to the eighth doctor in the 1996 television movie took advantage of the higher budget and modern computer animation technology to morph the features of sylvester mccoy into those of paul mcgann with the exception of the transitions from the second to third and the eighth to ninth doctors each regeneration was shown on screen with the previous incumbent in the role symbolically handing off the character to the next the second doctor was never seen to actually change into the third simply fading off into darkness at the end of the war games and then stumbling out of the tardis already regenerated at the start of spearhead from space 1970 the regeneration of the sixth doctor into the seventh is a special case colin baker declined the invitation to film the regeneration sequence at the start of time and the rani 1987 due to the circumstances in which the bbc dismissed him from the role as a result sylvester mccoy had to don his predecessor s costume and a blond curly wig lying face down with the mixing effect to the doctor s new features occurring as he was turned over the 2005 series which revived the programme after a 16 year hiatus began with the ninth doctor already regenerated with no explanation given in the documentary series doctor who confidential producer russell t davies explained his reasoning that after such a long hiatus a regeneration in the first episode would not just be confusing for new viewers but also lack dramatic impact as there would be no emotional investment in the character before he was replaced the regeneration of the ninth doctor into the tenth at the end of the parting of the ways 2005 was seen and also used computer effects to morph christopher eccleston into david tennant regeneration in the series the exact mechanism that makes regeneration possible is not stated in the television series but it is generally assumed in the spin off media that the ability to regenerate may be linked to what is known as the rassilon imprimatur named after the founder of time lord society the symbiotic nuclei of a time lord that bonds him or her to a tardis and allows his or her body to withstand the molecular stresses of time travel the two doctors 1985 in the christmas invasion 2005 it was stated the regenerative cycle generates a large amount of energy that suffuses the time lord s body as demonstrated by the tenth doctor in the first fifteen hours of regeneration this energy is enough to even rapidly regrow a severed hand it is first stated in the deadly assassin 1977 that a time lord can regenerate twelve times before dying thirteen incarnations in all there are exceptions to this rule however when the renegade time lord called the master finds himself the end of his regenerative cycle he takes possession of the body of another person to continue living the keeper of traken 1981 it may be that the time lords also have the ability to circumvent the limit in the five doctors 1983 the master is offered a new cycle of regenerations by the high council in exchange for his help the fact that the master is inhabiting a non gallifreyan body at the time implies that it is possible to grant them to a non gallifreyan albeit one inhabited by a time lord mind non gallifreyans are also seen to regenerate in underworld 1978 and mawdryn undead 1983 but with adverse side effects with regeneration also comes a change of personality which the viewing audience sees most often and most dramatically in the differing quirks and personality traits of the doctor s various incarnations however it appears that the doctor s core personality traits of heroism and intolerance of injustice are still retained the doctor also sometimes goes through a period of physical and psychological instability which may include partial amnesia following a regeneration but it is not clear if this is true of all time lord regenerations particularly since the doctor s regenerations tend to happen due to stressful and violent situations regenerations have been known to fail and may require assistance technological or otherwise or a period of recovery to successfully complete the process the brain of morbius suggests that time lords other than the doctor may experience difficult regenerations since the sisterhood of karn had been supplying them with an elixir of life that could assist the process in some cases future potential incarnations can achieve independent though temporary existence in planet of the spiders a time lord k anpo rimpoche creates a corporeal projection of a future incarnation which has such an existence until he regenerates into that incarnation in logopolis 1981 the fourth doctor encounters a similar projection the watcher which aids him during the course of the story and subsequently merges with him during his regeneration into his fifth incarnation the valeyard a distillation of the doctor s evil side that could potentially exist between his twelfth and final incarnations appears in the trial of a time lord 1986 and is offered the doctor s future regenerations to make his potential existence concrete the time lords ability to change species during regeneration is referred to by the eighth doctor in relation to the master in the television movie this is supported by the implication by the daleks that the first doctor s apparently human appearance was not his true form the daleks master plan 1965 and the fourth doctor s time lady companion romana s regeneration scene in destiny of the daleks 1979 in that scene romana demonstrates an apparent ability to try on different bodies from a number of different species during her regeneration before settling on a final gallifreyan form which physically resembles princess astra of atrios see romana s regeneration below while explaining the process of regeneration to rose at the end of the parting of the ways the ninth doctor suggests that his new form could have two heads or even no head although it is unclear if he is merely joking to reassure her in the 2005 children in need special which takes place immediately after the newly regenerated tenth doctor while examining his new body makes a point of checking that he has two arms two legs and two hands implying that regenerations can sometimes result in non humanoid forms whether this is also a joke is not clear in the runaway bride the tenth doctor tells donna noble that being human is optional for him whether or not time lords can recognise each other across regenerations is not made entirely clear in the television series in the deadly assassin an old classmate of the doctor s runcible does not recognise him in his fourth incarnation however in the armageddon factor 1978 drax another old classmate recognises the fourth doctor immediately although they had not seen each other since the academy the doctor takes a while to remember drax though in destiny of the daleks the doctor mistakes romana in her new form for the real princess astra and in the five doctors the third doctor is also unable to initially recognise the master in his non gallifreyan body similarly the eighth doctor does not recognise the master while he possesses a human body in the 1996 television movie however the master is able to recognise the seventh doctor on sight in survival 1989 although this may point to an earlier unseen encounter in school reunion 2006 k 9 mark iii recognises the tenth doctor despite having had no apparent contact with him since his fourth incarnation the doctor s regenerations main article the doctor s regenerations as noted the doctor frequently experiences a period of instability following regeneration some post regeneration experiences have been more difficult than others in particular the fifth doctor begins reverting to his previous personalities castrovalva and the sixth doctor experiences extreme paranoia flying into a murderous rage and nearly killing his companion the twin dilemma 1984 the eighth doctor not only experiences amnesia but some fans attribute his romantic actions towards his companion to post regeneration trauma the 1996 doctor who television movie the regeneration from the ninth doctor to the tenth doctor sees the doctor unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours the christmas invasion the experience is also traumatic enough to cause one of his hearts to temporarily stop beating the tardis also appears to aid in the regenerative process of the four occasions the doctor regenerates outside the tardis one is forced on him by the time lords the war games one requires a time lord to give the doctor s cells a little push to start the process planet of the spiders one needs the tardis s zero room a chamber sealed from all outside forces to help him recover castrovalva and the last occurs a few hours after he has actually died the 1996 television movie that last regeneration remains the only one that takes place significantly far away from the tardis without any obvious interaction from any time lords romana s regeneration romana s tongue in cheek regeneration scene in destiny of the daleks continues to be controversial with some fans the argument goes that since the doctor s own regenerations have usually been traumatic events and it had been established previously that time lords were limited to twelve regenerations it would therefore not make sense for romana to waste a number of regenerations so casually before settling on a form various theories have been advanced to resolve the apparent contradiction the change of appearance forced on the second doctor at the end of the war games suggests that some degree of control over the process can be asserted doctor who television writer and script editor eric saward suggests in his 1985 novelisation of the twin dilemma 1984 that time lords can control the appearance of their next body if they trigger the regeneration voluntarily but not if the regeneration is caused by death or injury the fan reference book the discontinuity guide by paul cornell martin day and keith topping suggests that the various try ons were projections of potential future incarnations like the watcher miles and wood s about time also mentions this along with theorising that the time lords had improved the technology of regeneration since the doctor s time romana being of a later generation than the doctor would therefore have finer control over the regenerative process in its early stages the regenerative energy present in the first hours of a regeneration as seen in the christmas invasion may provide another explanation for romana s ability to choose her regenerated form aside from the how of it at least two attempts have been made in the spin off media to explain the necessity for romana s regeneration in the short story the lying old witch in the wardrobe by mark michalowski published in the big finish productions anthology short trips companions unknown to the doctor romana suffers damage due to exposure to the key to time just as she is about to regenerate a humanoid manifestation of the tardis jealous of romana traps her in a force field and proceeds to pretend to be romana and changing into different forms finally becoming a double of princess astra this manifestation is the one who appears in destiny of the daleks realising the error of its ways after that adventure it releases romana but not before making the female time lord assume the image of astra the second explanation which may or may not be consistent with the first is given in the gallifrey audio series gallifrey

region right from the inception of the town the city was known earlier as pray ga a name that is still commonly used that it is an ancient town is illustrated by references in the vedas circa 1500 b c to prayag where brahma the hindu creator of the universe is believed to have attended a sacrificial ritual excavations have revealed northern black polished ware objects in prayag further corroborating the conjecture that prayag existed as a town as early as 1100 b c the puranas record that yayati left prayag and conquered the region of saptha sindhu his five sons yadu druhyu puru anu

romania in the aftermath of world war i a diverse community albeit an overwhelmingly urban one jews were the favorite target of religious persecution and racism in romanian society from the late 19th century debate over the jewish question and the jewish residents right to citizenship to the genocide carried out by romania as part of the holocaust the latter coupled with successive waves of aliyah has accounted for a dramatic decrease in the overall size of romania s present day jewish community early history jewish communities on what would later become romanian territory were attested as early as the 2nd century at a time when the roman empire had established its rule over what was then known as dacia inscriptions and coins have been found in such places as sarmizegetusa and or ova in the 8th century judaic khazars were present as far west as bessarabia three centuries later benjamin of tudela attested that jews from the byzantine empire were engaged in commerce with the vlachs

did not renew his persecutions after his return on the throne in 1564 the role of ottoman and local jews in financing various princes increased as ottoman economic demands were mounting after 1550 in the 1570s the influential jewish duke of the archipelago joseph nasi backed both heraclides and l pu neanu to the throne several violent incidents throughout the period were instigated by princes unable to repay their debts during the first short reign of peter the lame 1574 1579 the jews of moldavia mainly traders from poland who were competing with locals were taxed and ultimately expelled

moldavia by vasile lupu s carte româneasc de înv tur the latter ruler 1634 1653 treated the jews with consideration until the appearance of the cossacks 1648 who marched against the polish lithuanian

prohibited from wearing clothes of other colour that black or violet or to wear yellow or red boots the first blood accusation in moldavia and as such in romania was made april 5 1710 when the jews of târgu neam were charged with having killed a christian child for ritual purposes the instigator was a baptized jew who had helped to carry the body of a child murdered by christians into the courtyard of the synagogue on the next day five jews were killed others were maimed and every jewish house was pillaged while the representatives of the community were imprisoned and tortured meanwhile some influential jews appealed to prince nicholas mavrocordatos the first phanariote ruler in ia i who ordered an investigation resulting in the freeing of those arrested this was the first time that the orthodox clergy participated in attacks on jews it was due to the clergy s instigations that in 1714 a similar charge was brought against the jews of the city of roman the murder by a group of roman catholics of a christian girl servant to jewish family was immediately blamed on jews every jewish house was plundered and two prominent jews were hanged before the real criminals were discovered by the authorities another anti jewish riot occurred in bucharest in the 1760s and was encouraged by the visit of ephram ii patriarch of jerusalem under constantin brâncoveanu wallachian jews were

jewish savant daniel de fonseca at his court the most obvious effects on the condition of the jewish inhabitants of moldavia occurred during the reign of john mavrocordatos 1744 1747 a jewish farmer in the vicinity of suceava reported the prince to the porte for allegedly using his house to rape a number of kidnapped jewish women mavrocordatos had his accuser hanged this act aroused the anger of

moldavia and nicholas mavrogheni of wallachia pledged their special protection to the jews whose condition remained favorable until 1787 when both janissaries and the imperial russian army engaged in pogroms the community was also subject to persecutions by the locals jewish children were seized and forcibly baptized the ritual murder accusation became widespread one made at gala i in 1797 led to exceptionally severe results the jews were attacked by a large mob driven from their homes robbed waylaid on the streets and many killed on the spot while some were forced into the danube and drowned others who took refuge in the synagogue were burned to death in the building a few escaped after being given protection and refuge by a priest in 1803 shortly before his death the wallachian metropolitan iacob stamati instigated attacks on the bucharest community by publishing his înfruntarea jidovilor facing the yids which pretended to be the confession of a former rabbi however jews were offered refuge by stamati s replacement veniamin costachi a seminal event occurred in 1804 when ruler constantine ypsilanti dismissed accusations of ritual murder as the unfounded opinion of stupid people and ordered that their condemnation be read in churches throughout wallachia the allegations no longer surfaced during the following period during the russo turkish war of 1806 1812 the

carried out by joseph ii allowed jews to settle in towns directly subject to the hungarian crown however pressured placed on the community remained stringent for the following decades early 19th century by 1825 jewish population in wallachia almost completely sephardi was estimated at between 5 000 and 10 000 people of these the larger part resided in bucharest probably as much as 7 000 in

have reached 80 000 and over 195 000 or almost 12 of the country s population in 1859 with an additional 50 000 passing through to wallachia between the two estimates despite initial interdictions under the russian occupation of 1829 when it was first regulated that non christians were not to be regarded as citizens many of the new immigrants became leaseholders of estates and tavern keepers serving to increase both the revenue and demands of boyars leading in turn to an increase in economic pressures over those working the land or buying products usual prejudice against jews accused tavern keepers of encouraging alcoholism at the same time several jews rose to prominence and high social status most families involved in moldavian banking around the 1850s were of jewish origin

parties unionists and anti unionists each of which promised them full equality and proclamations to this effect were issued 1857 1858 in 1857 the community began issuing its first magazine israelitul român edited by the romanian radical iuliu barasch this process of gradual integration resulted in the creation of an informal romanian identity assumed by jews while conversion to christianity despite encouregement by the authorities remained confined to exceptional cases under alexander john cuza from the beginning of the reign of alexander john cuza 1859 1866 the first ruler domnitor of the united principalities the jews became a prominent factor in the politics of the country this period was however inaugurated by another riot motivated by blood libel accusations begun during easter 1859 in gala i in 1864 the prince owing to difficulties between his government and the general assembly dissolved the latter and decided to submit a draft of a constitution granting universal suffrage he purposed creating two chambers of senators and deputies respectively to extend the franchise to all citizens and to emancipate the peasants from forced labor expecting to nullify the remaining influence of the landowners no longer boyars after the land reform in the process cuza also expected financial support from both the jews and the armenians it appears that he kept the latter demand reduced asking for only 40 000 austrian guilder the standard gold coins about us 90 000 at the exchange rate of the time from the two groups the armenians discussed the matter with the jews but they were not able to come to a satisfactory agreement in the matter while cuza was pressing in his demands the jewish community debated the method of assessment the rich jews for unclear reasons refused to advance the money and the middle class argued that the sum would not lead to tangible enough results religious jews insisted that such rights would only interfere with the exercise of their religion cuza on being informed that the jews hesitated to pay their share inserted in his draft of a constitution a clause excluding from the right of suffrage all who did not profess christianity 1860s and 1870s when charles von hohenzollern succeeded cuza in 1866 as carol i of romania the first event that confronted him in the capital was a riot against the jews a draft of a constitution was then submitted by the government article 6 of which declared that religion is no obstacle to citizenship but with regard to the jews a special law will have to be framed in order to regulate their admission to naturalization and also to civil rights on june 30 1866 the bucharest synagogue was desecrated and demolished it was rebuilt in the same year then restored in 1932 and 1945 many jews were beaten maimed and robbed as a result article 6 was withdrawn and article 7 was added to the 1866 constitution it read that only such aliens as are of the christian faith may obtain citizenship for the following decades the issue of jewish rights occupied the forefront of the regat s political scene with few notable exceptions including some of junimea affiliates petre p carp george panu and ion luca caragiale most romanian intellectuals began professing anti semitism its most virulent form was the one present with advocates of liberalism in contradiction to their 1848 political roots especially moldavians who argued that jewish immigration had prevented the rise of an ethnic romanian middle class the first examples of modern prejudice were the moldavian frac iunea liber i independent later blended into the national liberal party pnl and the bucharest group formed around cezar bolliac their discourse saw jews as non assimilated and perpetually foreign this claim was however challenged by some contemporary sources and by the eventual acceptance of all immigrants other than jews anti semitism was carried into the pnl s mainstream and was officially enforced under the premierships of ion br tianu during his first years in office br tianu reinforced and applied old discrimination laws insisting that jews were not allowed to settle in the countryside and relocating those that had done so while declaring many jewish urban inhabitants to be vagrants and expelling them from the country according to the 1905 jewish encyclopedia a number of such jews who proved their romanian birth were forced across the danube and when ottoman empire refused to receive them were thrown into the river and drowned almost every country in europe was shocked at these barbarities the romanian government was warned by the powers and br tianu was subsequently dismissed from office cabinets formed by the conservative party although including junimeas leaders did not do much to improve the jews condition mainly due to pnl opposition nonetheless during this same era romania was the cradle of yiddish theatre the russian born abraham goldfaden started the first professional yiddish theatre company in ia i in 1876 and for several years especially during the russo turkish war of 1877 1878 romania was the home of yiddish theatre while its center of gravity would move first to russia then london then new york city both bucharest and ia i would continue to figure prominently in its history over the next century treaty of berlin and aftermath when br tianu resumed leadership romania faced the emerging conflict in the balkans and saw its change to declare independence from ottoman suzerainty by dispaching its troops on the russian side in the russo turkish war of 1877 1878 the war was concluded by the treaty of berlin 1878 which stipulated article 44 that the non christians in romania including both jews and muslims in the newly acquired region of northern dobruja should receive full citizenship after a prolonged debate at home and diplomatic negotiations abroad the romanian government ultimately agreed 1879 to abrogate article 7 of its constitution this was however reformulated to make procedures very difficult the naturalization of aliens not under foreign protection should in every individual case be decided by parliament the action involved among others a ten year term before the applicant was given an evaluation the gesture was doubled by a show of compliance 883 jews participants in the war were naturalized in a body by a vote of both chambers fifty seven persons voted upon as individuals were naturalized in 1880 6 in 1881 2 in 1882 2 in 1883 and 18 from 1886 to 1900 in all 85 jews in twenty one years 27 of whom in the meantime died cca 4 000 people had obtrained citizenship by 1912 various laws were passed until the pursuit of virtually all careers was made dependent on the possession of political rights which only romanians could exercise more than 40 of jewish working men including manual labourers were forced into unemployment by such legislation similar laws were passed in regard to jews exercising liberal professions in 1893 a piece of legislation was voted to deprive jewish children of the right to be educated in the public schools they were to be received only if and where children of citizens had been provided for and their parents were required to pay preferential tuition fees in 1898 it was passed into law that jews were to be excluded from secondary schools and the universities another notable measure was the expulsion of vocal jewish activists as objectionable aliens under the provisions of an 1881 law including those of moses gaster and elias schwarzfeld the courts exacted the oath more judaico in its most offensive form it was only abolished in 1904 following criticism in the french press in 1892 when the united states addressed a note to the signatory powers of the berlin treaty on the matter it was attacked by the romanian press the lasc r catargiu government was however concerned the issue was debated among ministers and as a result the romanian government issued pamphlets in french reiterating its accusations against the jews and maintaining that persecutions were deserved in exchange for the community s alleged exploitation of the rural population 20th century before and after world war i the emigration of romanian jews on a larger scale commenced soon after 1878 numbers rose and fell with a major wave of bessarabian jews after the kishinev pogrom in imperial russia 1905 the jewish encyclopedia wrote in 1905 shortly before the pogrom it is admitted that at least 70 per cent would leave the country at any time if the necessary traveling expenses were furnished there are no official statistics of emigration but it is safe to place the minimum number of jewish emigrants from 1898 to 1904 at 70 000 land issues and predominantly jewish presence among estate leaseholders accounted for the 1907 romanian peasants revolt partly anti semitic in message during the same period the anti jewish message first expanded beyond its national liberal base where it was soon an insignificant attitude to cover the succession of more radical and moldavian based organizations founded by a c cuza his democratic nationalist party created in 1910 had the first anti semitic program in romanian political history no longer present in the pnl s ideology by the 1920s anti semitism also tended to surface in on the left wing of the political spectrum in currents originating in poporanism which favoured the claim that peasants were being systematically exploited by jews world war i during which 882 jewish soldiers died defending romania and 825 were decorated brought about the creation of greater romania after the 1919 paris peace conference and subsequent treaties the enlarged state had an increased jewish population corresponding with the addition of communities in bessarabia bukovina and transylvania on signing the treaties romania agreed to change its policy towards the jews promising to award them both citizenship and minority rights the effective emancipation of jews the 1923 constitution of romania sanctioned these requirements meeting opposition from cuza s national christian defense league and rioting by far right students in ia i the land reform carried out by the ion i c br tianu cabinet also settled problems connected with land tenancy political representation for the jewish community in the inter war period was divided between the jewish party and the federation of jewish communities of romania the latter was re established after 1989 during the same period a division in ritual became apparent between reform jews in transylvania and usually orthodox ones in the rest of the country while bessarabia was the most open to zionism and especially the socialist labor zionism the popularity of anti jewish messages was nevertheless on the rise and merged itself with the appeal of fascism in the late 1920s both contributed to the creation and success of corneliu zelea codreanu s iron guard and the appearance of new types of anti semitic discourses tr irism and gândirism the idea of a jewish quota in higher education became highly popular among romanian students and teachers the threat posed by the iron guard the emergence of nazi germany as a european power and his own fascist sympathies made king carol ii who was still largely identified as a philo semite adopt racial discrimination as the norm on january 21 1938 carol s executive led by cuza and octavian goga passed a law aimed at reviewing criteria for citizenship after it cast allegations that previous cabinets had allowed ukrainian jews to obtain it illegally and requiring all jews who had received citizenship in 1918 1919 to reapply for it while providing a very short term in which this could be achieved 20 days in 1940 the ion gigurtu cabinet adopted romania s equivalent to the nuremberg laws forbidding jewish christian intermarriage and defining jews after racial criteria a person was jewish if he or she had a jewish grandparent on one side of the family the holocaust main articles romania during world war ii wiesel commission between the establishment of the national legionary state and 1942 80 anti jewish regulations were passed all sharply anti semitic starting at the end of october 1940 the iron guard began a massive anti semitic campaign torturing and beating jews and looting their shops culminating in the failed coup and a pogrom in bucharest in which 120 jews were killed antonescu eventually stopped the violence and chaos created by the iron guard by brutally suppressing the rebellion by the time romania entered the war however atrocities against the jews had become common most notably in the ia i pogrom where over 10 000 jews were killed in july 1941 even after the fall of the iron guard the antonescu regime allied with nazi germany continued the policy of oppression and massacre of jews and to a lesser extent roma according to an international commission report released by the romanian government in 2004 romania murdered in various forms between 280 000 to 380 000 jews in romania and in the war zone of bessarabia bukovina and transnistria in 1941 following the advancing romanian army after operation barbarossa and alleged attacks by jewish resistance groups antonescu ordered the deportation to transnistria of all jews of bessarabia and bukovina between 80 000 and 150 000 who were considered communist agents by the official propaganda deportation however was a euphemism as part of the process was to kill as many jews as possible before deporting the rest in the trains of death to the east of those who escaped the initial ethnic cleansing in bukovina and bessarabia only very few managed to survive trains and the concentration camps set up in transnistria further killings perpetrated by antonescu s death squads documents prove his direct orders and involvement targeted the jewish population that the romanian army managed to round up when occupying transnistria over one hundred thousand of these were in massacres staged in such places as odessa the odessa massacre when romanian troops shot of over 100 000 jews during the autumn of 1941 bogdanovka akmecetka in 1941 and 1942 antonescu did halt deportations despite german pressure in 1943 as he began to seek peace with the allies although at the same time he levied heavy taxes and forced labor on the remaining jewish communities also sometimes with the encouragement of antonescu s regime thirteen boats left romania for the british mandate of palestine during the war carrying 13 000 jews two of these ships sunk and the effort was discontinued after german pressure was applied half of the 320 000 jews living in bessarabia bukovina and the former dorohoi county in romania were murdered within months of the entry of the country into world war ii during 1941 even after the initial killing jews in moldavia bukovina and bessarabia were subject to frequent pogroms and were concentrated into ghettos from which they were sent to concentration camps including camps built and run by romanians the number of deaths in this area is not certain but even the lowest respectable estimates run to about 250 000 jews and 25 000 roma in these eastern regions while 120 000 of transylvania s 150 000 jews died at the hands of the hungarians later in the war see northern transylvania romanian soldiers also worked with the german einsatzkommando to massacre jews in conquered territories antonescu s government made plans for mass deportations from the regat to belzec but never carried them out nonetheless in stark contrast to many countries of eastern and central europe the majority of romanian jews survived the war although they were subject to a wide range of harsh conditions including forced labor financial penalties and discriminatory laws the number of victims however makes romania count as according to the wiesel commission of all the allies of nazi germany for the deaths of more jews than any country other than germany itself post war according to the world jewish congress there were 428 312 jews in romania in 1947 mass emigration ensued much of it to the british mandate of palestine and later israel and much of it technically illegal see berihah by 1956 there were 144 236 jews in romania from 1948 until 1960 more than 200 000 romanian jews went to israel reducing the population in romania to less than 100 000 by the 1960s during the period of transition towards a communist regime in romania following soviet occupation see soviet occupation of romania jewish society and culture were subject to the same increasingly tight control by the authorities the community leader wilhelm filderman was arrested in 1945 and had to flee the country in 1948 on april 22 1946 gheorghe gheorghiu dej attended a meeting of jewish organizations and called for the creation of a new body the jewish democratic committee which was in reality a section of the romanian communist party pcr after the proclamation of the people s republic the government formed by the pcr outlawed all jewish organizations at a meeting on june 10 june 11 1948 stating that the party must take a stand on every question concerning the jews of romania and fight vigorously against reactionary nationalist jewish currents is zionism in 1952 1953 the stalinist anti semitic charge of rootless cosmopolitanism brought the purging of the party s own leadership including ana pauker the charge was then inflicted on the larger part of the jewish community beginning with a trial engineered by iosif chi inevschi jews who were perceived as zionists were given harsh labour sentences in communist prisons such as pite ti where they were subject to torture and brainwashing experiments several died the 1952 trial of enginners made responsible for the failure of the danube black sea canal project also involved allegations of zionism notably aimed at aurel rozei rozenberg

the guinness book of records as the longest street in the world and is a national historic site yonge street is home or close to many attractions in toronto including street and theatre performances the eaton centre dundas square the hockey hall of fame sam the record man and at the very start of the road one yonge street the offices of the toronto star the yonge line of the toronto subway runs under and in open cuts beside yonge street from south of king street to finch avenue the viva blue brt line continues along yonge from finch to newmarket terminal history and significance yonge street was originally a military trail linking lake ontario with the northern great lakes for this reason it is unusually long and straight it was founded by john graves simcoe the lieutenant governor of upper canada now ontario in 1793 simcoe chose its beginning and end points based on a historical trail created by huron indians the trail was used by numerous european explorers such as samuel de champlain in 1615 simcoe named the street after sir george yonge the british secretary of war at the time because of fears of u s aggression simcoe wanted to move the capital of upper canada from newark now niagara on the lake to a more defensible position he chose yonge street to be the site of the new capital hence yonge street became the first street of the city that would become toronto yonge street was fundamental in the planning and layout of toronto and ontario it was used as the basis for concession roads in ontario it was the site of toronto s first subway line it also serves as the dividing line between the east and west parts of east west roads in toronto and york region yonge is the zero numbering point for those east west streets building numbers on such streets increase as one moves further away from yonge evolution of yonge street john graves simcoe used the queen s rangers to survey and build the road and established lots along it so that settlers would further clear and improve it by the early part of the 19th century yonge street ran from lake ontario to holland landing providing a link between the lower and upper great lakes through holland river and lake simcoe yonge street became the baseline around which the other concession lines of york county were drawn the lot numbers on this street reach into the 21000s in 1824 work began to extend yonge street to kempenfelt bay near barrie a northwestern extension branched off the original yonge street in holland landing and ran into the new settlement of bradford before turning north towards barrie work was completed by 1827 the road was further extended to penetanguishene on the shores of georgian bay serving a naval base this section of road was referred to not as yonge street but penetanguishene road the decision was made to withdraw the military garrison in penetanguishene in 1852 settlers by and large avoided the road preferring to follow the line of the railway established a few years before between barrie and collingwood confederation and the construction of the national transcontinental railroad further diminished the importance of yonge street as the new dominion of canada heralded the construction of east west trade routes from sea to sea by the 1870s dr scadding historian of toronto of old declared that penetanguishene did not have the importance to need an approach such as the extension of the yonge street road roads and railroads pushed settlement northeast along the shores of lake simcoe and north up the shores of georgian bay to north bay in the 1920s looking to support the rapidly developing mining and agricultural communities in northern ontario the government of ontario sought to connect these communities to the south by commissioning a highway between north bay and cochrane after construction crews pushed through the dense temagami forest the road was officially opened on july 2 1927 and named the ferguson highway after the hon g howard ferguson the premier of ontario and longtime supporter of northern development the ferguson highway as well as other roads leading to barrie and yonge street itself were incorporated into kings highway 11 in the 1930s the northern stretch of highway 11 became part of the trans canada highway and by 1965 highway 11 extended from the foot of yonge street on the shores of lake ontario to rainy river on the border between ontario and minnesota yonge street today today yonge street exists in name as two segments and a branch the current road runs from lake ontario through toronto and the york region to north of newmarket before breaking from the baseline and heading northwest along the holland landing bypass constructed 1959 into bradford at the holland river yonge street changes its name to bridge street 56 kilometres north of lake ontario and then changes its name to holland street a few blocks later to follow the old highway 11 one must turn right onto barrie street and drive out of bradford where the yonge street name is picked up again the name disappears in south barrie just over 100 kilometres north of lake ontario changing to burton avenue at a midblock location and the road itself ends a few blocks later at a t intersection with essa road the original baseline road continues through holland landing petering out roughly 56 kilometres north of lake ontario as it approaches cook s bay on lake simcoe penetanguishene road continues to exist it was incorporated into the kings highway network as highway 93 the modern penetanguishene road deviates from the original somewhat and is not as straight but the original can still be seen in some places labelled as old penetanguishene road there is also a yonge street in midland ontario which runs from penetanguishene road to the midland bay another yonge street can be found in elmvale ontario yonge street as the longest street in the world yonge street was a part of ontario provincial highway 11 which led to claims that yonge street was the longest street in the world running from the shores of lake ontario through central and northern ontario to the ontario minnesota border at rainy river highway 11 was over 1 896 kilometres long but yonge street could only be called the longest street in the world if highway 11 and yonge street were synonymous which was debatable however the guinness book of world records recognized this claim as late as 1998 changes in provincial responsibility separated the now locally funded and controlled yonge street from highway 11 during the 1990s as a result provincial highway 11 does not start until after the city of barrie or crown hill just north of where the name yonge street ends the guinness book of world records no longer lists yonge as the longest street in the world citing instead the pan american highway as the world s longest motorable road this has not stopped torontonians from clinging to the claim although current tourist campaigns do not make much of it its status as an urban myth is bolstered by an art installation at the foot of yonge street and a map of its length laid out into the sidewalk in bronze at the southwest corner of yonge and dundas streets configuration south of the former toronto north york city limit at yonge boulevard yonge street is a four lane historic urban arterial with heavy pedestrian traffic passing through commercial and residential areas between yonge boulevard and highway 401 exit 369 yonge opens up somewhat into parkland of the west don valley hoggs hollow and lower density residential areas between highways 401 and 407 exit 77 densities and traffic increase as yonge becomes a six lane principal urban arterial road through north york civic centre and an older section of thornhill beyond highway 407 remaining a principal arterial road yonge is a suburban commercial strip with several exceptions in historic areas with sections of residential and still undeveloped land through newmarket the speed limits are generally 50 km h 30 mph in most of the city of toronto and through thornhill 60 km h 35 mph on a short section through the west don valley and again in most of the suburban sections north of the 407 dropping back to 50 at times in some historic areas and 70 80 km h 45 50 mph in undeveloped or lightly developed areas in the northern sections north of steeles yonge street is signed as york regional road 1 in york region except in holland landing where it is york regional road 51 and simcoe county road 4 in simcoe county cultural significance yonge street is frequently considered to be toronto s main street because of its position dividing the city east and west and the presence of the yonge subway line as a result it is the traditional gathering place for public celebrations when the toronto blue jays won the world series in 1992 and 1993 it was estimated that 1 000 000 people gathered in the vicinity of the intersection of yonge and dundas and for many blocks north and south a similar gathering occurred in 2002 when the canadian olympic mens hockey team defeated the united states for the gold medal during lesser celebrations like stanley cup playoff victories by the toronto maple leafs motorists drive up and down the street honking their horns and flying flags it is predicted that if the leafs were to win the stanley cup something not achieved since 1967 yonge street would be home to the greatest party in sports history sections of the street are often closed for other events such as an annual street festival the intersection of yonge and dundas centred on the plaza at dundas square has been closed on occasion to host free concerts with a major one being a free concert put on by r e m on may 17 2001 attended by 20 000 people in 2006 beyoncé and john mayer performed at the square on september 15 and 16 respectively toronto s annual gay pride and santa claus parades also use yonge street for a significant portion of their routes in 1998 on the

 id=37171 title cray 1 nonfiltered 1450 processed 1430 dbindex 1561470 the cray 1 was a supercomputer designed by a team including seymour cray for cray research the first cray 1 system was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976 and it went on to become one of the best known and most successful supercomputers in history history in the early 1970s cray was working at control data on a new machine known as the cdc 8600 the logical successor to his earlier cdc 6600 and cdc 7600 designs the 8600 was essentially made up of four 7600 s in a box with an additional special mode that allowed them to operate lock step in a simd fashion jim thornton formerly cray s engineering partner on earlier designs had started a more radical project known as the cdc star 100 unlike the 8600 s brute force approach to performance the star took an entirely different route in fact the main processor of the star had less performance than the 7600 but added additional hardware and instructions to speed up particularly common supercomputer tasks in 1972 the 8600 had reached a dead end the machine was so incredibly complex that it was impossible to get one working properly even a single faulty component would render the machine non operational cray went to william norris control data s ceo saying that a redesign from scratch was needed at the time the company was in serious financial trouble and with the star in the pipeline as well norris simply couldn t invest the money cray left starting a new company hq only yards from the cdc lab both in the back yard of land he purchased in chippewa falls wi he and a group of former cdc employees started looking for ideas at first the concept of building another supercomputer seemed impossible if cdc couldn t afford it how could a tiny company with no funding but after the cto traveled to wall street and found a lineup of investors more than willing to back cray all that was needed was a design in 1975 the 80 mhz cray 1 was announced excitement was so high that a bidding war for the first machine broke out between llnl and los alamos the latter eventually winning and receiving serial number 001 in 1976 for a six month trial the national center for atmospheric research ncar was cray research s first official customer in july 1977 paying us 8 86 million 7 9 million plus 1 million for the disks the ncar machine was decommissioned in january 1989 the company expected to sell perhaps a dozen of the machines but over eighty cray 1s of all types were sold priced from 5m to 8m the machine made cray a celebrity and the company a success lasting until the supercomputer crash in the early 1990s the cray 1 was succeeded in 1982 by the 800 mflops cray x mp the first cray multi processing computer in 1985 the very advanced cray 2 capable of 1 9 gflops peak performance succeeded the two first models but met a somewhat limited commercial success because of certain problems at producing sustained performance in real world applications a more conservatively designed evolutionary successor of the cray 1 and x mp models was therefore made by the name cray y mp and launched in 1988 background typical scientific workloads consist of reading in large data sets transforming them in some way and then writing them back out again normally the transformations being applied are identical across all of the data points in the set for instance the program might add 5 to every number in a set of a million numbers in traditional computers the program would loop over all million numbers adding five thereby generating a million instructions saying a add b c internally the computer solves this instruction in several steps first it reads the instruction from memory and decodes it then it collects any additional information it needs in this case the numbers b and c and then finally runs the operation and stores the results vector machines in the star new instructions essentially wrote the loops for you you told the machine where in memory your big list of numbers was stored and then fed in a single instruction a 1 1000000 addv b 1 1000000 c 1 1000000 at first glance it appears the savings are limited in this case the machine fetches and decodes only a single instruction instead of 1000000 thereby saving 1000000 fetches and decodes perhaps of the overall time but the real savings are not so obvious internally the computer s cpu is built up from a number of parts dedicated to a single task for instance adding a number or fetching from memory normally as the instruction flows through the machine only one part is active at any time meaning the whole process has to complete before a value is written out but the addition of an instruction pipeline changes this in such machines the cpu will look ahead and start fetching the next instructions while the first is still being worked on in this assembly line fashion any one instruction still takes as long to process but as soon as one completes the next is already almost done vector processors use this technique with one additional trick because the data layout is known basically a set of numbers arranged linearly in memory the pipelines can be tuned to improve the performance of fetches on the receipt of a vector instruction special hardware sets up the memory access for the arrays and stuffs the data into the processor as fast as possible cdc s approach in the star used what is today known as a memory memory architecture this referred to the way the machine gathered data setting up its pipeline to read and write to memory directly this allowed it to use vectors of any length or width or stride as it is known making it highly flexible unfortunately the pipeline had to be very deep in order to allow it to have enough instructions in flight to make up for the slow memory and that meant the machine had a very high cost when switching from processing vectors to normal data additionally the slow normal performance of the machine meant that after the switch had taken place and the machine was running typical logic instructions the performance was quite poor the result was rather disappointing real world performance something that might have been obvious had the designers considered amdahl s law cray s approach cray was able to look at the failure of the star and learn from it he decided that in addition to fast vector processing his design would also require excellent all round logic performance as well that way when the machine switched modes it would still be the fastest out there additionally they noticed that the workloads could be dramatically improved in most cases through the use of registers just as earlier machines had ignored the fact that most operations were being applied to many data points the star ignored the fact that those same data points would be repeatedly operated on whereas the star would read and process the same memory five times to apply five vector operations on a set of data it would be much faster to read them in once and apply all five operations while sitting in cpu s registers registers are extremely expensive in terms of circuitry so only so many could be provided meaning that cray s design would have less flexibility in terms of vector sizes instead of reading any sized vector several times as in the star in the cray design the machine would have to read small parts of the data at a time but then run several operations at once given typical workloads cray felt that the small loss due to having to access memory in steps was a cost well worth paying since the typical vector operation would involve loading a small set of data into the vector registers and then running several operations on it the vector system of the new design had its own separate pipeline for instance the multiplication and addition units were implemented as separate hardware so the results of one could be internally pipelined into the next the instruction decode having already been handled in the machine s main pipeline cray referred to this concept as chaining as it allowed programmers to chain together several instructions and extract higher performance description the new machine was the first cray design to use integrated circuits ics although ics had been available since the 1960s it was only in the early 1970s that they reached the performance necessary for high speed applications the ics used in the cray 1 were extremely simple generally containing four gates each containing perhaps four transistors in all the cray 1 contained about 200 000 gates roughly the same as the intel 386 of the 1980s ics were mounted on large five layer printed circuit boards with up to 144 ics per board boards were then mounted back to back for cooling see below and placed in twenty four 28 inch high racks containing 72 double boards the typical module distinct processing unit required one or two boards in all the machine contained 1 662 modules in 113 varieties one problem discovered during initial design was that the operating speed of the machine was close enough to the signal times on the boards a deliberate design feature that standing waves could be set up in some of the electrical circuits this meant that the signal might be arriving at its destination ic at a low point in the standing wave making it difficult to detect this problem was solved by adding slight delays into the signal path either by placing foil beside the traces to add a small amount of capacitance or alternately adding additional ics at the signal s high points some estimates state that about 40 of the gates in the machine were there simply to add delay and clean up the signal as always cray spent a considerable time on the mechanical and electrical design of the system improving performance through shortened cycle times modules were wired to each other with high power circuits to reduce the effects of noise allowing the receivers to settle faster each cable between the modules was made of twisted pair and cut to very specific lengths in order to avoid electrical reflections every amplifier was balanced so if one wire was put to high power another was lowered thereby making the demand on the power supply constant and avoid switching noise all of this high power circuitry generates considerable heat and as always cray s designers spent as much effort on the refrigeration system as the rest of the mechanical design in this case each circuit board was paired with a second placed back to back with a sheet of copper between them the copper sheet conducted heat to the edges of the cage where liquid freon running in pipes draws it away to the cooling unit below the machine the first cray 1 was delayed six months due to problems in the cooling system lubricant that is normally mixed with the freon to keep the compressor running would leak through the seals and eventually coat the boards with oil until they shorted out new welding techniques had to be used to properly seal the tubing in order to wring every possible ounce of speed out of the machine the entire chassis was bent into a large c shape speed dependent portions of the system were placed on the inside edge of the chassis where the wire lengths were shorter this allowed the cycle time to be decreased to 12 5ns 80mhz not as fast as the 8ns 8600 he had given up on but fast enough to beat his earlier cdc 7600 and the star ncar estimated that the overall throughput on the system was 4 5 times the cdc 7600 the cray 1 was built as a 64 bit system a departure from the 7600 6600 which were 60 bit machines a change also planned for the 8600 addressing was 24 bit for a maximum of 1 megaword 8mb of main memory memory was spread across 16 banks each with a 50ns cycle time allowing up to four words to be read per cycle the main register set consisted of eight 64 bit scalar s registers and eight 24 bit address a registers these were backed by a set of sixty four registers each for s and a temporary storage known as t and b respectively which could not be seen by the functional units the vector system added another eight 64 word by 64 bit vector v registers as well as a vector length vl and vector mask vm finally the system also included a 64 bit clock and four 64 bit instruction buffers that held sixty four 16 bit instructions each the hardware was set up to allow the vector registers to be fed at one word per cycle while the address and scalar registers required two in contrast the entire sixteen word instruction buffer could be filled in four cycles the system used twelve functional units but had limited parallelism it could fetch one instruction per clock cycle into the units but operate on them in parallel and would retire two its theoretical performance was thus 160 mips 80 mhz 2 instructions although there were a few limitations that made floating point performance generally about 136 megaflops however by using vector instructions carefully and building useful chains the system could peak at 250 megaflops since the machine was designed to operate on large data sets the design also dedicated considerable circuitry to i o earlier cray designs at cdc had included separate computers dedicated to this task but this was no longer needed instead the cray 1 included four 6 channel controllers each of which was given access to main memory once every four cycles the channels were 16 bits wide and included 3 control bits and four for error correction so the maximum transfer speed was 1 word per 100ns or 500k words per second for the entire machine the initial model the cray 1a weighed 5 5 tons including the freon refrigeration system configured with 1 million words of ram the machine and its power supplies consumed about 115 kw of power cooling and storage likely more than doubled this figure a data general supernova s 200 was generally used as a front end to feed control instructions into the machine later replaced by the eclipse the later cray 1s had a slightly faster clockspeed of 12 0ns and main memory in sizes of 1 2 and 4 million words the data general machines were replaced with an in house 16 bit design running at 80 mips the i o system was separated from the main machine connected to the main system via a 6mb per second control channel and a 100mb per second high speed data channel this separation made the 1s look like two half crays separated by a few feet which allowed the i o system to be expanded as needed systems could be bought in a variety of configurations from the s 500 with no i o and m word of memory to the s 4400 with 4m words and 4 i o processors the cray 1 s was itself replaced by the cray 1m the m indicating that it used less expensive mos based ram in the i o system the 1m was supplied in only three versions the m 1200 with 1m word in 8 banks or the m 2200 and m 4200 with 2 or 4m in 16 banks all of these machines included two three or four i o processors and the system added an optional second high speed data channel users could also add an solid state storage device a ram disk with 8 to 32m words of mos ram software

 id=5741663 title lindy hop today nonfiltered 1454 processed 1434 dbindex 1561474 lindy hop is only one of many swing dances popular today and there are thriving local communities throughout the world structurally lindy hop s basic step the swing out combines both closed position and open position and is clearly related to the charleston dance it is the most popular swing dance in australia today and in many other swing dancing communities and its revival in the 1980s has since seen local communities develop in many cities international scenes while the united states is home to the largest number of lindy hoppers in the world there are thriving communities throughout europe including russia the ukraine hungary and other eastern european countries england ireland spain france nederlands denmark finland sweden switzerland germany and lithuania in australia canada new zealand japan korea singapore and buenos aires argentina the small village of herräng in sweden north of stockholm has unofficially become the international mecca of lindy hop due to the twenty year old annual herräng dance camp run by the harlem hot shots los angeles also features prominently in lindy hop culture today with many clubs exchanges and the annual camp hollywood demographics the majority of lindy hoppers today are middle class youth this is in part a result of the high costs of both learning the dance and attending dance events locally and internationally but also a result of the ways in which it is marketed by dance schools and promoted by dancers in the united states which is home to the vast majority of lindy hoppers today universities and colleges play central roles in organising events and classes and most of the on campus clubs are populated by students the high costs of studying at a tertiary level in that country therefore see a largely middle class demographic represented in these associations beyond the university based lindy hop communities in the united states the largest lindy hop communities are in larger cities such as new york and los angeles again the costs of classes and the time hungry demands of this difficult dance often exclude those without the time money and opportunity to devote to lindy hop internationally similar patterns are found in other countries from canada to the united kingdom though universities play a smaller role local dance communities are largely representative of the more affluent or dominant cultural groups within their wider social context in cities such as london there are often more older dancers as the higher costs of living in these cities often prevent many younger or less financially able dancers attending as many dances or events as they might wish in australia the general population of lindy hoppers is younger with most dancers in their teens and early twenties this is largely the result of promotional activities by larger dance schools for whom this group offers an ideal market and by once again the time and financial resources demanded by lindy hopping for countries such as australia and new zealand travel adds an additional financial requirement as the largest and most respected teachers and events are located in the united states and europe similar comments may be made about the lindy hop community in singapore korea and japan offer slightly different examples though there is again a preponderance of younger middle class youth in these local communities the lindy hop communities in russia however offer an interesting contrast dancers in these cities are occasionally subsidised by wealthier countries and as an example russian dancers have received subsidised passes for large dance camps such as herrang in sweden culture despite the cultural and social differences between local communties lindy hoppers have much in common they not only share specific dance forms but also dance cultures there is great enthusiasm for social dancing in most lindy hop communities with of course allowance for regional variation and lindy hoppers are often keen travellers the lindy exchange culture which developed in the united states and canada coupled with a european enthusiasm for holiday camps has seen the development of many large events held throughout the world which not only attract local dancers but also visitors from other communities there is a strong culture of hospitality in lindy hop culture today and many young lindy hoppers travel internationally or within their own country for the first time to visit dancers and dance events this emphasis on travel is encouraged and facilitated by the preponderance of online communication in lindy hop culture many internet forums have emerged in local lindy hop scenes these message boards serve to provide information to dancers about lindy hop and dance events in the geographic area yehoodi has become the largest of these and now caters to an international audience although many smaller local forums such as swingmonkey also exist local swing dance related internet forums often reflect the local variations in scenes cultures and dancing because swing dancers travel to dance quite regularly internet forums are an important medium for communication between local scenes and for dancers visiting a particular city or country music while lindy hop developed as a response to swing jazz in the 1920s and 30s its popularity today can be largely attributed to the popularity of neo swing music of the swing revival in the late 1990s and early 2000s as swing jazz is not the popular music of the twenty first century and jazz and its cousin blues have themselves undergone significant changes since the original swing era there are ongoing discussions within the lindy hop community about the types of music which best suit the dance lindy hop is frequently danced to a range of music beyond swing jazz including blues rhythm and blues jump blues jazz groove soul and hip hop as well as rockabilly and country in the american south and southeast despite these differences in taste lindy hop is historically and practically associated with artists such as duke ellington count basie ella fitzgerald benny goodman chick webb lionel hampton and so on lindy hoppers are particularly fond of big band arrangements by and featuring these and other musicians live music is still very popular with lindy hoppers and many dancers have formed close relationships with local artists in their own communities newer artists such as george gee bandleader and the lincoln center jazz orchestra have proved particularly popular with lndy hoppers despite this relationship with live music recorded music djed by dancers is the most popular musical medium for lindy hoppers today djing itself has assumed great signifiance in lindy hop culture with dancers and djs alike hotly debating which types of music should be played and when the discussion board is a clear example of an online community within the lindy hop community which has developed solely around the playing of music for dancing lindy hop local influences lindy hop as it is danced today varies not only between local scenes through the influence of local cultures and teachers but as individual dancers model their movements on the styles of influential dancers of both contemporary and past eras these historical influences may include the african american lindy hoppers of the savoy ballroom including frankie manning and the whitey s lindy hoppers white dancers from the west coast including dean collins and jewell mcgowan or dancers from even more specific periods in history the style wars of the 1990s and early 2000s where lindy hoppers debated the relative merits of different eras and dancers resulted in terms such as savoy style lindy hop generally associated with original new york city african american dancers and hollywood style lindy hop based on the lindy hop of white dancers in hollywood films the current international lindy hop community recognises a far greater diversity not only in lindy hop styles than is accounted for by these two terms but also in swing dances more generally lindy hop today is not only influenced by historic dance forms but also by popular contemporary dances and music such as soul groove funk hip hop styling and music west coast swing and salsa while others explore jazz tap blues and other traditional jazz and african american dances as resources to expand and enrich lindy hop types of lindy many dancers with an interest in lindy hop as a historical dance insist that social dancing is essential to developing the skills of an accomplished dancer these dancers frequently cite frankie manning s insistence that his dance troupes social dance every night as well as train for performances in order to maintain their dancing at its highest level lindy hop today however is danced as a social dance as a competitive dance as a performance dance and in classes and workshops in each partners may dance alone or together with improvisation a central part of social dancing and many performance and competition pieces solo sequences in lindy hop are sometimes executed as part of a partner dance when one or both of the partner initiates a breakaway causing the partners to separate their connection and dance solo with each other using if at all visual lead and follow cues these sequences may include charleston moves traditional jazz moves such as boogie steps shorty george suzie q etcetera and contemporary jazz and modern dance movements choreographed routines are frequently danced on the social floor as well as in competitions performances and classes with some of the most famous examples including shim sham dean collins shim sham jitterbug stroll lindy chorus big apple tranky doo first stops social dancing etiquette and traditions social lindy hop dancing varies in each city and country with each local scene having its own unique dance etiquette and social conventions generally lindy hop is danced by a lead and follow partnership with the lead most frequently being a man and the follow being a woman this gendering is not essential men are as capable of dancing the follow role as women and vice versa in many local scenes women often feel more comfortable dancing with other women though there are frequently wider social and cultural conventions which discourage men from dancing together dance floor etiquette varies in each scene where for example one scene may encourage men to ask women to dance another encourage advanced dancers to ask beginners and in a third only friends ask each other to dance in some scenes it is considered rude to leave a partner without having a second dance while in many scenes there are unspoken conventions about teachers dancing with students more experienced dancers dancing with beginners and so on there are no consistent rules between local scenes though there are often national or international patterns social lindy hop not only involves partners dancing unchoreographed dances but also a range of other traditions and activities jam circles are a tradition dating back to the 1930s and earlier in african american vernacular dance culture and have much in common with musical cutting contests in jazz malcolm x describes jam circles in his autobiography as a loose circle forming around a couple or individual whose dancing was so impressive it captured the attention of dancers around them who would stop and watch cheering and clapping this tradition continues in most lindy hop communities today with other couples interrupting joining or replacing the original couple in the cleared circle dancers usually leave or enter at the end of a musical phrase many lindy hoppers insist that these jams be unchoreographed with dancers entering or leaving the circle independently though many jams are choreographed whether as part of a performance or simply because a local scene does not practice unchoreographed jams the jam format is often used to celebrate a special event a birthday engagement wedding etc to welcome a visitor or to farewell a local these jams are often announced by the dj the focus dancer or couple begin in a cleared circle with other dancers gathering to clap and cheer these watching dancers will cut in or steal one of the partners in a couple or the special dancer to dance with them in the circle until they are in turn replaced events social dancing events run by dancers are diverse and vary in duration theme and venues between local communities dancers usually distinguish between regular events or after class practice sessions dancing to live bands at public events not run by dancers and special dances or the more formal ball social dancing events may be held as part of a lindy exchange or camp or be regular parts of the scene s calendar live bands frequently provide the opportunities for social dancing in many new or small scenes and attract groups of dancers attending gigs at local bars or clubs to dance socially social dancer run lindy hop dances are held in a range of spaces from private parties to church and town halls bars gymnasiums university halls night clubs pub function rooms and any other space with enough room for a dance floor individual events may attract anywhere from ten to a thousand dancers and may run from as little as half an hour to all night music may be provided by djs by live bands or by music left to play unattended on a sound system depending on the local scene s conventions and the nature of that particular event djs and bands may play a range of music from the 1920s to today tending to concentrate on big band music from the 1930s and 1940s live bands play a wide variety of music for lindy hoppers from big band standards and blues to original compositions there are ongoing debates about the types of music most appropriate for lindy hop and other swing dances with the discussions focussing on whether the music should be historically accurate ie matching a dance style with the popular music of the day or include other musical styles and forms social dances attract dancers from a range of ages and backgrounds and dress may range from rigorously vintage or historically accurate to a particular swing era 1920s 30s 40s 50s etc to casual sports or street wear again depending on local culture and the event itself performance dancing lindy hop is generally considered a very dynamic form of dance lindy performances may combine choreographed routines improvised sequences solo and partner dancing and frequently feature the aerial dance move steps for which it is perhaps most famous contemporary lindy hoppers often recreate or perform historical choreographed routines found in films or taught by swing era dancers such as frankie manning the most well known of these include the lindy chorus the hellzapoppin routine from the film hellzapoppin and the big apple from the film keep punchin performances are often held at social dancing events as part of a brief floor show often to showcase a visiting teacher a local troupe or to display a particular dance style solo performances and performances by couples are as important as troupes and performances of all types are often integrated into a social dancing event rather than held as separate events there are exceptions to this with the rhythm hot shots touring internationally and holding swing dance shows as part of teaching tour lindy hop dance schools and clubs frequently include a performance troupe with membership in these troupes determined by a range of factors from general auditions by invitation as a prerequisite for a teaching position with a school or to display a rare dancing skill or style performance groups that had an impact on the development of lindy hop include the following whitey s lindy hoppers aka harlem congaroos hot chocolates the big apple dancers new york city founded in 1935 the rhythm hot shots from sweden founded in 1985 now called the harlem hot shots the hot shots have been a major driving force in the worldwide revival of lindy hop from the 1980s onward minnie s moochers ithaca new york loose change san francisco california blends lindy hop with hip hop and african modern dance silver shadows american swedish troupe comprised of young dancers performing historical african american lindy hop lindy hop performance troupes are often quite different to a professional modern dance or ballet company they are usually amateur groups their members may vary in experience and ability and they often serve as promotional vehicles for lindy hop schools and clubs lindy hop s nature as a predominantly social dance with its roots as a self learned vernacular dance combined with the comparative lack of experts resources and public demand in many local communities also contribute to its differences as does the fact that most lindy hoppers come to the dance in the twenties or late teens rather than as children who train for many years before joining performance groups reasons to form or be in such a troupe vary but usually belong to one or more of the following categories artistic reasons pursuing the art of dancing and the continuous artistic expression through jazz dance and lindy hop commercial reasons to perform at paid gigs essentially continuing the tradition of vaudeville and supplying entertainment for those who pay for it competition to compete with a selected team set choreographies and test one s skills versus other dance teams practice to enhance the dancers of the participating dancers work on new materials or engage in dance movement that is not possible on the social dance floor such as aerials or other moves that require pre arranged agreement between the dancers partners pleasure in performing or dancing promotion for a particular lindy hop school or club or to encourage people to take up the dance competition dancing competitions have a long history in lindy hop from the informal dance rivalries carried out in jam circles and on the social dance floor to more formal competitions such as the harvest moon ball competitions of the 1920s and 30s where shorty george snowden is popularly attributed with naming the dance today lindy hop competitions vary in form and intent from lindy hop categories in ballroom dancing and dancesport competition to national events run by particular schools or dancing associations to competitions held as part of a camp or exchange weekend to small and informal competitions in local communities there are ongoing discussions and debates about the relevance of competitions in lindy hop culture from criticisms that formal showcase type events encourage a movement away from the improvised spontaneity and energy of lindy hop as a vernacular dance to arguments that competitions hone dancing and performance skills whichever position a dancer takes on the issue it is suffice to say that different competition forms and specific events develop different dancing skills and serve different social political and economic purposes there are a range of competition types and competition nights frequently feature categories in each of the following styles there are some exceptions such as the hellzapoppin competition which only features the no rules competition format almost all of these competitions are couple dances though some involve elements of solo dancing many lindy hop competitions distinguish between professional and amateur dancers include invitation only categories offer cash prizes and are judged by well respected lindy hop dancers most are not regulated by any national or international body jack and jill jack and jill competitions imitate social dancing dancers enter as individuals as either a jack leader or jill follower most competitions do not dictate jills be female or jacks male there are however jack and jack and jill and jill competitions where men and women are paired separately entrants are paired with partners randomly and then dance to music whose duration varies they are then allocated another random partner jack and jill competitions vary in strict format with some ending at this point and judges awarding points for performances to that stage many jack and jills often continue with dancers paired with a third partner or remaining with their second for the remaining rounds of the competition partners dance to different tempo and style songs either in all skates where all dancers are on the floor or shines where couples take to the floor alone usually at phrase long intervals entrants are judged on their ability to lead and follow though criteria and judging style and importance vary between competitions and scenes showcase entrants in showcase competitions perform choreographed performance routines showcases can be for pairs or groups though usually not in the same competition can involve pairings of amateur and professional dancers pro am and can be judged by any combination of criteria no rules the 2000s have seen the increasing popularity of lindy hop competitions without rules the hellzapoppin competition named for the film hellzapoppin was held for the first time in 2002 and coordinated by the american institute of vernacular jazz dance it was originally designed as an alternative to the strictly regulated and ruled showcase type competitions which dominated the lindy hop competition culture at that time these were frequently run by competitive or performance dance organisations such as dancesport or by dancing academies who did not emphasise or promote social lindy hop dancing the no rules style competition was presented as an alternative to these formal competitions and were designed to emphasise social dancing skills and some references to the vernacular dance tradition of lindy hop the no rules approach was just that any dance move or style was allowed again a reaction to the heavily codified showcase style competitions despite this no rules mandate couples are frequently disadvantaged if they use extensive choreography in their performance no rule competitions often involve some degree of audience approval judging these competitions usually involve the turn taking and shine all skate formats described in the jack and jill section though in a range of combinations while they may also be invitation only they are frequently open to all competitors from all experience levels despite the emphasis on partner dancing in these sorts of competitions there is often much interaction between competitors and between the audience and competitors frequently in the employment of comic devices such as silly walks or impersonations or showy and physically impressive stunt moves such as aerials this type of interaction is typical of the call and response of west african and african american music and dance in this call and response audiences and fellow competitors encourage dancers with cheers shouts applause physical gestures and other feedback major competitions hellzapoppin lindy competition a no rules competition

harvest moon ball national jitterbug championship world jitterbug championship technique and steps dance movement moves and patterns see list of lindy hop moves for a list of lindy hop dance moves partnering technique partnering technique is the element of lindy hop which controls the communication of the dancers engaged in the dance the dance partners partnering technique allows both dancers to lead and follow dance movement move together and or communicate dance ideas to each other either in an open conversation or a call and response structure see also connection dancers at social events usually have a wide range of skill levels so cooperating with one s partner matters as much as dancing skill dancing with a new partner is a study in flexibility and calibration what can the new partner do what are his or her limitations what does he or she like to do dancing with a regular partner is an opportunity to play and practice difficult moves such as aerials which are dangerous without regular practice more important than moves is connection in simple form any point of body contact between partners is connection which allows both partners to communicate social dancers are generally concerned about connection whether their partner feels good rather than whether their partner is capable of doing a number of moves in succession this connection also allows both partners to style with each other and the music resulting in a totally improvised musical dance musicality musicality is the skill allowing the dancer to create and execute choreography either prepared in advance or improvised on the spot on the dance floor to match and more significately represent the music including the melody and the rhythm dancers with a good sense of musicality respond to all elements of the music to which they are dancing they may choose to accentuate certain elements to make an artistic statement about the music through movement when watching dancers with good musicality viewers should be able to see the song in the dancers movements so that even without music the song would still be recognizable through the dance itself in jazz music there are many elements in a song to which a dancer could respond these elements could be the melody the counter melody the phrases and breaks in the melody the beat the back beat the drums the bass the keys of the piano and any other musical or rhythmic components the musicality develops slowly over time new dancers frequently focus on moves independent of the music whereas more advanced dancers will match their movements to what they hear in the music in order to dance with musicality a dancer must have a strong sense of rhythm and a good ear for music as well as a solid base of knowledge about the techniques and basic moves

revolt against the british state in ireland in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century the irb played an important role in the history of ireland it was the chief group advocating armed revolt during the campaign for ireland s independence from the united kingdom during the latter half of the nineteenth century it was formed in the 1850s by james stephens and organised an abortive revolt in 1867 although the irb co operated with charles stewart parnell s irish parliamentary party which opposed violent action in the 1870s and 1880s during the land war it also was associated with a dynamite campaign in english cities in the 1880s its members often referred to themselves as fenians its counterpart in the united states of america was organized by john o mahony and known as the fenian brotherhood later clan na gael which would organize several raids into british canada from 1866 to 1871 in an effort aimed at exchanging control of canada for ireland s freedom origins james stephens one of the men of 1848 a participant in the 1848 revolt had established himself in paris and was in correspondence with o mahony in the united states and other radical nationalists at home and abroad a club called the phoenix national and literary society with jeremiah donovan afterwards known as o donovan rossa among its more prominent members had recently been formed at skibbereen stephens visited it in may 1858 and made it the centre of his preparations for armed rebellion the object of stephens o mahony and other leaders of the movement was to form a league of irishmen in all parts of the world against british rule in ireland the organization was modelled on that of the jacobins of the french revolution they even formed a committee of public safety in paris with a number of subsidiary committees and affiliated clubs the fenians were soon found in australia south america canada and above all in the united states as well as in the large cities of great britain such as london manchester and glasgow the fenians had more trouble gaining the support of the tenant farmers or agricultural labourers in ireland because of their fears of british government reprisals the early movement was also denounced by the roman catholic church as indeed were all irish separatist movements that advocated the use of force one irish bishop famously declared that hell is not hot enough nor eternity long enough for the fenians it would be a few years after its foundation before the irb made much headway the phoenix club conspiracy in county kerry had been betrayed by an informer and was crushed by the government some twenty ringleaders were put on trial including donovan and when they pleaded guilty were with a single exception treated with leniency 1867 revolt and land agitation about the same time the irish people a revolutionary journal was started in dublin by stephens and for two years advocated armed rebellion and appealed for aid to irishmen who had received military training and experience in the american civil war at the close of that war in 1865 numbers of irish who had borne arms flocked to ireland and the plans for a rising were worked on the government well served as usual by informers now took action in september 1865 the irish people was suppressed and several of the more prominent fenians were sentenced to terms of penal servitude stephens through the connivance of a prison warder escaped to france the habeas corpus act was suspended in the beginning of 1866 and a considerable number of persons were arrested the failed revolt the following year proved a serious setback to the irb s hopes with numerous arrests in both ireland and britain in the years following the failed revolt leaders of the irb carried out their own foreign policy and courted support from ambassadors of nations they perceived as enemies of england when the chances of war with england were fading irb looked for allies among other irish national groups and on the cusp of the 1870 1880s their attempts at coalition building were successful from amongst the many irish nationalist organisations a coalition was formed among the irb and sections of the irish land league in 1882 a breakaway irb faction calling themselves the irish national invincibles assassinated the british chief secretary for ireland lord frederick cavendish and his secretary see phoenix park murders in march 1883 the london metropolitan police s special irish branch was formed initially as a small section of the criminal investigation department cid to monitor irb activities subsequently the term irish branch was replaced by the special branch title as over time it took on responsibility for countering a wider range of revolutionary and anarchist activity nineteenth century fenianism was among the most important movements in modern irish history its radicalism influenced later leaders like patrick pearse and éamon de valera and the irb was well placed in the subsequent independence movement with michael collins at the helm however though influential in radical nationalism the early irb never gained widespread popular support and its attempts to stage rebellions in ireland failed dismally its impact was through the ideas it developed among later irish nationalists later history revitalised from about 1910 the irb was the chief organising force behind the easter rising of 1916 under the leadership of such men as tom clarke sean macdermott and patrick pearse the irb infiltrated the irish volunteers and commandeered them to act as the military wing of the republican movement against the wishes of the volunteers leadership it was also a major influence during the 1919 21 irish war of independence its president since the summer of 1919 was michael collins who was also a chief organising force behind the irish republican army due to collins leadership the irb accepted the anglo irish treaty agreed by collins with the british government as compatible with its aims and dissolved itself in fact collins used the irb in 1922 as a vehicle for getting the treaty accepted by ira officers this was somewhat strange as the irb had up to this point been the most extreme irish republican organisation anti treaty republicans like ernie o malley who fought a civil war against the treaty saw the irb at this time as being used to undermine the irish republic following the civl war in 1924 the supreme council under collins protoge richard mulcahy as chairman voted to dissolve the organization deeming that its goals had been achieved organisation the irish republican brotherhood was led by an eleven member supreme council consisting of representatives from the seven districts in which the organization was active the irish provinces of ulster munster leinster and connacht as well as scotland north england and south england four other members were co opted and together this council elected three of its members to the executive which consisted of president secretary and treasurer the oath the oath of the irish republican brotherhood changed throughout the years though the one probably best known goes as follows in the presence of god i do solemnly swear that i will do my utmost to establish the independence of ireland and that i will bear true allegiance to the supreme council of the irish republican brotherhood and the government of the irish republic and implicitly obey the constitution of the irish republican brotherhood and all my superior officers and that i will preserve inviolable the

 id=3180335 title the practice of everyday life nonfiltered 1492 processed 1472 dbindex 1561512 the practice of everyday life is a book by michel de certeau which examines the ways in which people individualise mass culture altering things from utilitarian objects to street plans to rituals laws and language in order to make them their own it was originally published in french as l invention du quotidien vol 1 arts de faire 1974 the 1984 english translation is by steven rendall the practice of everyday life re examines related fragments and theories from kant and wittgenstein to bourdieu foucault and détienne in the light of a proposed theoretical model some consider it as being enormously influential in pushing cultural studies away from producer product to the consumer introductory chapter the practice of everyday life begins by pointing out that while social science possesses the ability to study the traditions language symbols art and articles of exchange that make up a culture it lacks a formal means by which to examine the ways in which people reappropriate them in everyday situations this is a dangerous omission de certeau argues because in the activity of re use lies an abundance of opportunities for ordinary people to subvert the rituals and representations that institutions seek to impose upon them with no clear understanding of such activity social science is bound to create nothing other than a picture of people who are non artists meaning non creators and non producers passive and heavily subject to received culture indeed such a misinterpretation is borne out in the term consumer in the book the word user is offered instead the concept of consumption is expanded in the phrase procedures of consumption which then further transforms to tactics of consumption in the book ordinary life is depicted as a constant subconscious struggle against the institutions competing to assimilate everyday man the chief aim of practice is to compile a vocabulary of concepts questions and perspectives that would make possible the formal discussion of the everyday tactical activities which lie hidden behind the cloak of conformity the main concepts de certeau defines two kinds of behaviour the strategic and the tactical he takes the terms out of their military context and injects them with new meaning he describes institutions in general as strategic and everyday people who are non producers as tactical a strategy is an entity that is recognised as an authority it may be anything from an institution or a commercial outfit to an individual whose behaviour coincides with the author s proposed definition of strategic a strategy may enjoy status as the dominant order or be sanctioned by the powers that be it manifests itself physically in its site s of operations offices headquarters and in its products laws language rituals commercial goods literature art inventions discourse it has use of dedicated resources and is expected to incur considerable overheads because it represents an enormous investment in space actual buildings and assets and time its own history traditions its ways are set it cannot be expected to be capable of breaking up and regrouping easily something which a tactical model does naturally in other words a strategy is relatively inflexible because it is embedded in its proper its spatial or institutional localization the goal of a strategy is to perpetuate itself through the things that it makes maximum efficiency means being able to sell the narrowest array of products to the widest possible market thus its concerns are mass production and the homogenising of its audience besides creating its products it may work by creating its market by creating uniformity and need uniformity is of benefit to a strategy therefore it is engaged in the work of systematising of imposing order the strategy is capable of defining itself as producer manufacturer as opposed to user and has only indirect contact with its audience its input from users may come from polls focus groups and case studies while its contact with the outside world might come in the form of advertising and public relations campaigns de certeau s tactical model describes individuals or groups which are fragmented in terms of space and maintain no specific site of operation no headquarters but who are capable of swiftly combining according to a current necessity therefore necessity spurs a tactic into existence while with a strategy need is a thing that might have to be created after the product with no ownership of dedicated resources a tactic manages to be lean compared to a strategy it is essentially makeshift in nature and cannot rely on a proper instead it depends on a gift economy on time it waits for resources it does not own or did not make to go idle and on loopholes it will infiltrate but will not try to take over the last detail is a feature that distinguishes it from guerrilla warfare a tactic does not seek to win or take over it does not engage in sabotage alert to its status as the weak it makes no attempt to take a strategy on but seeks to fulfill its needs behind an appearance of conformity aware that the things around it have been created to cater to the lowest common denominator it expects to have to work on things in order to make them its own or to make them habitable its products are not necessarily objects e g they may be as invisible and personal as the alteration of a story during the process of reading or of a recipe while cooking the tactic manifests itself not in its products but in its methodology it might be performed by an individual or a transient grouping that does not last long enough to require a label unlike the strategy it lacks the centralised structure and permanence that would enable it to set itself up as a competitor to some other entity de certeau says that the tactic s diffuse form does two things it effectively deflects a strategy s influence and it renders its own activities an unmappable form of subversion he pointed out that in its slipperiness lies a good deal of its power this occurs through the unconscious ways people try to make things like books and city street systems habitable in their minds social science or science in general cannot hope to be able to map tactical activity but it can try at least to make its formal discussion possible bibliography de certeau michel the practice of everyday life trans steven rendall university of california press berkeley 1984 cummings neil reading things chance books london 1993

 id=4109203 title the geologic origins of natchez mississippi nonfiltered 1518 processed 1498 dbindex 1561538 most every city is located where it is for very logical reasons because cities are at the most basic level commercial centers they were usually located with direct access to rivers lakes seas or oceans as roads and railroads were developed cities grew up on those routes some cities came about for more complex reasons and they are a more interesting study for that reason natchez ms u s a is such a place natchez was settled because its location is at the junction of two very different means of transportation that developed over thousands of years this succession of events and conditions traces its origin back to geologic history natchez s history begins more than 12 000 years ago when the most recent ice age is ending and the river is about 30 miles wide at the point where the city of natchez stands today the land on the east is higher about 75ft above sea level than the west about 65 ft today lower then as the deluge begins ending the land to the west becomes a vast plain of finely ground dust washed down by the river for a long period a strong west wind carried this dust loess across the river and it began to accumulate east to a series of ridges about 6 10miles from the river over eons this accumulation reached more than100 feet just yards from the river s eastern edge these bluffs are among the highest on the lower mississippi south of memphis the east side of the river is home to a vast hardwood forest containing many species of trees not usually associated with the lower south elm ash walnut and many others the west side is a delta flat and fertile herds of large animals began to migrate through this area but because the forest was so dense with very little grasslands they were forced to continually move between the river at present natchez and salt licks on a river about 500 miles to the northwest the cumberland near present day nashville over time a series of game trails were etched into the landscape about 6 000 bc the first humans moved into this area probably about 8 000 years ago where they came from will start an argument among any group of natchez history lovers they were small groups usually related by blood and ranged throughout the area on the east bank of the river because the west flooded every spring over the millennia they coalesced into tribes which began the civilization of the area they discovered the game trails and used them for their travels throughout the area they had a very obvious though not generally thought about problem you could use the streams to get goods down to the great river and trade but you couldn t paddle upstream they used the game trails to return back north to their homes in fact the tribal centers were all located very near to what became the trace to the north of milepost 62 the dominant tribe was the choctaw south of them and extending their reach to the river were the natchez named so by the french the natchez became a highly developed and civilized def permanently domiciled tribe they had a clear sense of property ownership laws and social propriety so advanced were they that by the time the french arrived they had no warrior class because they had established long standing arrangements with the tribes surrounding them they had great wealth so wealthy in fact they became some of the most prolific mound builders in what is now the united states by the 1690s the natchez were the only mound building society still existing in the u s canada area mound building was a religious ritual the building was done by members of the tribe not by slaves emerald mound just a mile or so off the trace is the second largest such structure in the country by the time the europeans arrived the natchez had abandoned the emerald mound site and moved very close to the river within the present natchez city limits to a site called the grand village now a state dept of archives and history park about 1690 the coasts of america are being settled by europeans the spanish on the pacific and more actively the british on the atlantic the french by now confined their north american colonies to canada british colonialization had mostly ended its western movement the major means of moving goods and material to ports for shipping was by barge on the rivers on the eastern coast and once they got to the allegheny s the rivers ran the wrong way into the vast uncharted wilderness the french had come to realize that whatever nation got control of the mississippi river would gain the real potential of north america they began to search for a place to settle that would become the most powerful trading center on the continent a site located as near as possible to the mouth of the mississippi that also met two very important criteria 1 a friendly tribe who could help them survive and 2 a way to get back to civilization after the long journey down the river

 id=8076363 title robin in other media nonfiltered 1531 processed 1511 dbindex 1561551 this article is about the comic book superhero robin as he appears in other media such as films television and radio in almost all mediums his secret identity is dick grayson from the 1940s to 1980s he wore a costume much like the classic suit of grayson since the 1990s dick grayson s original pixie outfit has been avoided instead robin grayson usually wears a costume matching the original uniform of tim drake drake the third and current robin in the comics has only been identified as the secret identity of one robin in other media 1940s in director lambert hillyer s 1943 film serial the batman robin was played by douglas croft batman s radio series with robin the batman mystery club in which batman told ghost stories never aired one episode was made monster of dumphrey s hall during radio broadcasts of the adventures of superman radio drama batman and robin were paired with superman over the years from september 15 1945 to 1949 the pairing was pure novelty the batman and robin appearances provided time off for bud collyer the voice of superman on radio these episodes called for superman to be occupied elsewhere and the crime fighting would be handled by batman and robin on that series the voice of robin was played by ronald liss in the 1949 columbia pictures movie serial robin the boy wonder was played by 26 year old johnny duncan in the adventures of batman and robin 1949 directed by spencer gordon bennet 1960s to early 1980s in the campy 1960s batman television series and its 1966 movie offshoot robin dick grayson was played by burt ward burt s version of robin was known for the catchphrase holy pun batman in dc comics related cartoon series produced by filmation and hanna barbera throughout the 1970s and 1980s such as the super friends robin dick grayson was voiced by casey kasem or burt ward both the live action and animated versions wore the standard robin costume much like the film serial versions of the 1940s late 1980s to late 1990s film robin did not appear in the tim burton movies batman 1989 and batman returns 1992 this was the first time in which batman and robin were not presented as an inseparable pair to those who did not read the comics at all an unused idea from the first film shows his parents murdered by the joker the special edition version of the dvd has an animated storyboard sequence of one of the scenes from this subplot the scene in which dick grayson s parents are killed he would have been played by ricky addison reed appeared as robin by the end of the film burton felt it was unimportant to the story and cut robin altogether due to loren lester being absent dick grayson s voice was provided by jason hillhouse in this special feature in an earlier script of batman returns he was portrayed as a technologically savvy street kid who would help batman following his narrow escape when the penguin tried to kill him later on he would play a crucial role in batman s final confrontation with the penguin he is simply known as robin and has no known real name he was to be played by marlon wayans after the 1980s robin would appear again but not in dick grayson s classic costume in joel schumacher s batman forever 1995 with val kilmer as the dark knight grayson s parents were murdered by two face during a hostage situation at the annual gotham circus the movie featured chris o donnell at age 24 portraying the role of a robin who met batman and became a costumed hero in his late teens o donnell reprised the role again in the 1997 film batman robin with george clooney as the batman in those films the tension between batman and robin was greater than in most adaptations in batman forever his costume closely resembles the robin uniform worn by tim drake in the latter film robin s costume resembled dick grayson s third nightwing costume but with rubber nipples a cape and red crimson coloring instead of blue this latter outfit has been compared to the renegade outfit dick grayson wore in comic books many years after the films animation the first two seasons of which debuted in 1992 featured robin dick grayson voiced by loren lester only occasionally because he was attending college in its third and final season 1994 1995 the show was retitled the adventures of batman and robin as robin appeared regularly in the series dick grayson wore a costume much like tim drake s original suit in the reinvention of the series 1997 1999 dick grayson became nightwing and his place as robin was taken by tim drake voiced by mathew valencia the animated series continuity does not include jason todd by name but the cartoon s drake is described as a combination of a young grayson todd and drake between his origin and appearance in he mostly resembled todd in storyline while bearing little resemblance to the comic book s tim drake a 2006 costume adopted by drake in the comics seems very similar to the animated drake s red and black outfit a version of the carrie kelly robin also makes a short appearance in batman gotham knights in a dream sequence in the episode legends of the dark knight 2000s in the krypto the superdog episode bathound and the robin a robin called robbie is saved by ace the bathound and wants to be ace s sidekick much to the dismay of ace robbie s costume resembled the classic outfit of dick grayson in a june 2005 interview christopher nolan the director of batman begins and the dark knight revealed that as long as he is directing the franchise robin will not be appearing since christian bale is portraying batman as a young man at the time of robin is still a little kid at this point when asked who he would cast if he was forced to nolan replied frankie muniz jokingly saying if he doesn t age too quickly lego produced its lego batman line of licensed sets in 2006 currently into its first wave the 7783 the batcave the penguin and mr freeze s invasion set features robin in the classic costume with a mini speedboat 7785 arkham asylum includes nightwing and his motorcycle as well robin is a playable character in the teen titans video game for game boy advanced robin is a playable character in both the story and master of games modes for the console teen titans game robin will be featured in the dc dtv movie justice league new frontier teen titans animated series the cartoon network series teen titans appears to be an adaptation of the new teen titans comic book series one similarity is that both series have the character robin who also acts as the team s leader in the comic book series as noted above dick grayson is robin in the animated series his costume is still closely modeled on tim drake s as in the 1990s robin voiced by scott menville has not been referred to by any full name this non identity is intentional according to both sam register and glen murikami however several clues have indicated that this robin is dick grayson a time travel themed episode of the animated series showed a future where robin has taken on the role of nightwing a role taken up by dick grayson in a later episode an alternate universe robin with the exact same dna shows up named nosyarg kcid which is dick grayson spelled backwards this latter clue was confirmed by the creators at a panel at the 2005 san diego comic con in many instances robin s relationship to batman is heavily referenced in the season 5 episode go just before robin attacks a thief bats fly at him after a while the thief says aren t you supposed to be with only to be interrupted by robin who says just moved here i work alone now throughout the episode he says he doesn t want to be in a team again so soon in another episode haunted raven uses her powers to enter robin s mind one of the images she sees is robin s shadow in a cave area swearing an oath to someone when robin rejects slade in apprentice part 2 he mentions i already have a father and then the screen shows a shot of a dark sky with bats flying through it also referring to batman in that same episode a battle ensues on top of a building that says wayne enterprises the batman tv series in the batman dick grayson was an energetic gifted acrobat and one of the main attractions of hayley s circus along with his mother mary and father john as part of the amazing flying grayson s act his life was changed forever when tony zucco and his brothers tried to threaten john into taking a protection policy when john grayson refused an altercation resulted in the police and the batman being called the zuccos were easily defeated for the moment one of tony s brothers was even captured an angered zucco altered the rigs on the flying graysons trapeze act causing john and mary to fall to their deaths right in front of dick during a performance young grayson with no surviving family members was taken in by bruce wayne who saw shades of himself in dick after his own parent s murder after dick discovered that wayne was batman the two worked together to capture tony zucco dick chose the codename robin because that is what his mother had called him grayson sports a costume much

 id=166138 title power of attorney nonfiltered 1547 processed 1526 dbindex 1561568 a power of attorney or letter of attorney in common law systems or mandate in civil law systems is an authorization to act on someone else s behalf in a legal or business matter the person authorizing the other to act is the principal or grantor of the power and the one authorized to act is the agent or attorney in fact the attorney in fact acts in the principal s name for example by signing the principal s name to documents attorney in fact as one kind of agent an attorney in fact is a fiduciary for the principal so the law requires an attorney in fact to be completely honest with and loyal to the principal in their dealings with each other if the attorney in fact is being paid to act for the principal the contract is a separate matter from the power of attorney itself so if that contract is in writing it is a separate document kept private between them whereas the power of attorney is intended to be shown to various other people in the context of the unincorporated reciprocal inter insurance exchange the attorney in fact is a stakeholder trustee who takes custody of the subscriber funds placed on deposit with him and then uses those funds to pay insurance claims when all the claims are paid the attorney in fact then returns the leftover funds to the subscribers the term attorney in fact should not be confused with the term attorney at law an attorney at law in the united states is a lawyer someone licensed to practice law in a particular jurisdiction in most other common law jurisdictions lawyers are not called attorneys and the term attorney generally refers to either attorneys in fact or lawyers from the united states oral and written powers of attorney the power of attorney often called poa for short may be verbal such as asking someone else to sign your name on a cheque because your arm is broken or may be in writing many institutions such as hospitals banks and in the united states the internal revenue service require a power of attorney to be in writing before they will honor it and they usually want to keep an original for their records the equal dignity rule the equal dignity rule is a principle of law that requires a document authorizing someone representing someone else to have been appointed with the same formality as required for the act the representative is going to perform and it applies to powers of attorney this means for example that if you give someone your power of attorney to sign the papers to sell your house and the law requires that signature on the deed to be notarized then your power of attorney authorizing that attorney in fact to sign the deed must be notarized too kinds of powers of attorney a power of attorney may be special or limited to one specified act or type of act or it may be general and whatever it defines as its scope is what a court will enforce as being its scope it may also be limited as to time under the common law a power of attorney becomes ineffective if its grantor dies or becomes incapacitated meaning unable to grant such a power because of physical injury or mental illness for example unless the grantor or principal specifies that the power of attorney will continue to be effective even if the grantor becomes incapacitated but any such power ends when the grantor dies this type of power of attorney is called a durable power of attorney in some jurisdictions such a durable power of attorney can also function as a living will which can be used to appoint someone to make health care decisions for the grantor up to and including pulling the plug on machines keeping them clinically alive new york state has enacted a health care proxy law that requires a separate document be prepared appointing one as your health care agent in some u s states and other jurisdictions it is possible to enact a springing power of attorney i e a power that only takes effect after incapacitation of the grantor or some other definite future act or circumstance after such incapacitation the power is identical to a durable power but unlike a durable power cannot be invoked before the incapacity this is often used to allow a spouse or family member to manage the grantor s affairs in case illness or injury makes him unable to act while retaining the power for himself before the incapacity occurs if a springing power is used care should be given to specifying exactly how and when the power springs into effect as the result of privacy legislation in the u s medical doctors

a five second time limit from 1973 to 1975 in a spoof of the word would self destruct in a scanimate animation sequence after the time limit expired the word you see here will self destruct in five seconds can you read it before it does after 1975 the viewers had to read the word before a cast member often a member of the short circus did giggles goggles two friends usually rita moreno and judy graubart conversed when one of them misused a word e g flack as in flap when the other was talking about something with the word flap several words similarly tied by prefix or suffix were humorously misused until they get back to the original word that s what i was trying to tell you remarked one of the characters after which the other fumed in frustration here s cooking at you send up of julia child with judy graubart playing julia grown up j arthur crank jim boyd s plaid wearing character who often interrupted sketches to complain when spellings or pronunciations confused him in early episodes he was just a voice on the phone much like an irate viewer on a radio call in show in one sketch he sang a song devoted to his spiritual cousin oscar the grouch crank is named after british film mogul j arthur rank and refers to what would be later known as crank calling jennifer of the jungle george of the jungle send up with judy graubart and paul the gorilla jim boyd usually opened with jennifer swinging on viney the vine yeling oy yoi yoi yoi the last word always came at the end of the show featured in season 1 instead of the next show teasers from later seasons the camera would show a barely lit incandescent bulb on a pull chain switch hanging from a wire the voice of ken roberts would state and now the last word gravely a single word would appear usually one that had been featured earlier in the episode an unseen cast member would read the word aloud reach his her arm into the shot and turn the light off by tugging the pull chain love of chair spoof of the soap opera love of life about a boy skip hinnant sitting on a chair announcer ken roberts who appropriately enough also announced for love of life read the day s story told in the style of the old dick and jane primers with questions asked at the end in a dramatic tone the last question asked was always and what about naomi this would be followed by for the answer to these and other questions at which point a cast member would be shown briefly on screen uttering a completely unrelated question such as what time is it seen primarily during the 1971 1972 season a shot of the boy sitting on the chair was used for the friday closing credits during the first season mad scientist another monster based parody this time with an evil scientist morgan freeman and his assistant igor luis avalos trying to read words mel mounds a disc jockey morgan freeman who introduced songs usually by the short circus known for the phrase sounds righteous delightious and out of sighteous heavy heavy finger snap heavy ha ah millie the helper rita moreno as an eager but point missing trainee in various professions millie s bellowed catchphrase hey you guys soon became a part of the show s opening monolith an animated short set in outer space used to introduce segments discussing a sound cluster a huge washington monument type structure begins to collapse to the strains of the richard strauss composition also sprach zarathustra also the theme of the film and the appropriate sound cluster would be chisled from the structure such as alk oo ow all ee a skit based on a scene from the film 2001 was usually built around this segment with the characters always cowering in fear and awe as the music begins pandora rita moreno s bratty but lovable curly headed blonde girl who tried to outwit the adults around her phyllis the pharaohs a 1950s doo wop group with rita moreno on lead vocals its hits include phantom of love grease and is it love road runner new segments of the looney tunes character and his pursuer wile e coyote produced and directed by chuck jones these segments reinforced reading skills these segments unlike the classic warner bros shorts were completely devoid of sound save for sound vocal effects such as laughing and sound effects such as the switching of a traffic light or the bouncing on a trampoline sign sing along sometimes the last sketch on a friday episode filmed segments were married to a sing along type song e g i like fish food you do too don t look now your hair is blue with filmed snippets of a sign with said words sung once through after which the viewers were expected to supply the lyrics the second time around all right now we ll be quiet and you sing it while a wah wah muted trumpet and bassoon duo played the melody of the words alternate vignettes depicting literal translations of road signs for example slow motion action of children playing for a slow children sign the six dollar and thirty nine cent man a spoof of the six million dollar man with jim boyd as steve awesome who had far more bionic features than his more serious counterpart introduced in season 5 and became a recurring sketch in season 6 slow reader originally a set of animated shorts but at least one live action sketch was shot based on the same characters and theme a bald headed slow reader is given a message to read by a delivery man and has trouble sounding out the words each message is advice he needs to follow such as do not bother this giant person go away duck keep off the grass but winds up not understanding the words or meaning until it is too late in later years however a few of the original sketches were slightly rewritten and reanimated with a much smarter slow reader who does not fall victim to any impending dangers soft shoe silhouettes two cast members appeared in silhouette one giving the prefix of the word the other the suffix to form a new word e g th and ing to form thing most notable for the soft shoe type music that played during the segment done twice through sometimes with the viewer trying to read the word the second time through the song usually ended with the two saying a soft yeah parodies of this skit have aired on the following family guy in the episode mr saturday knight where peter is one of the silhouetted characters reading the words he quickly becomes frustrated at his inability to keep up with the other character and attacks him madtv part of a larger sesame street parody depicting big bird catching and spreading avian flu on the street the silhouetted characters sound out the words flu fever and fatal saturday night live miranda richardson hosted in a short film called dieter s dream the silhouettes alternate with the words whore and nun to make the nonsense word whorenun describing miranda richardson s character in the film nike athletic wear s boom television advertisement campaign from the late 1990s avenue q broadway musical adult parody of sesame street between two scenes a male silhouette appears saying the word come followed by a female who says the word mitment the two alternate until the female takes over saying the word commitment spidey super stories short pieces that featured the marvel comics character spider man which was provided to ctw free of charge and cast members from the show stories involved the web masked superhero danny seagren foiling mischievous characters involved in petty criminal activities such as burglary or assault interestingly spider man spoke only in cartoon word balloons appearing over his head which were accompanied by electronic punctuation sounds for emphasis when the appeared on screen also unlike in the pages of marvel comics he was never seen out of costume as his alter ego peter parker debuted during season 4 and was the basis for a spin off comic book the segment s theme song also claimed spider man nobody knows who you are vaudeville revue also called the stage skits and songs were presented variety show style on stage with music fanfare and canned applause to introduce and end each segment a very short book typically the last sketch of an episode in which a very short story is read by a member of the cast based on nursery rhymes or fairy tales and having a humorous ending always finished with the words the end vi s diner customers tried to read simple menus to place their order at proprietor vi s lee chamberlin eatery grover from sesame street made a guest appearance in a season two skit because he was lost and in tears and he needed the help of vi and j arthur crank to get back home the short circus june angela julie irene cara 1971 1972 iris stephen gustafson 1971 1975 buddy melanie henderson 1971 1975 kathy douglas grant 1971 1973 zach denise nickerson 1972

another regular part of the show was the short circus the name a pun on short circuit a singing group of kids whose songs also facilitated reading comprehension june angela was the only short circus member to remain with the show during its entire six year run she was 11 when production began and 17 during its final season others lasted anywhere from one to four years irene cara appeared only during the first season and would go on to become a pop music star fame flashdance cara was replaced by denise nickerson best known for her appearance as violet beauregarde in the 1971 film willy wonka and the chocolate factory the other three original members of the short circus were melanie henderson who at 13 was the oldest of the original group stephen gustafson and douglas grant for the show s third and fourth seasons grant and nickerson were replaced by talented dancer gregg burge and broadway actress bayn johnson except for june angela an entirely new short circus was cast for the 1975 1977 seasons because previous members were getting too old the new hires were todd graff ilene graff s brother rodney lewis réjane magloire and janina matthews in the first season a number of unbilled children were also used on camera with the show s cast as on sesame street but this concept was very quickly dropped because of the frequent reuse of segments a practice derived from sesame street actors continued to appear after their departures from the cast music joe raposo who was famous for his work on sesame street was the music director of the series for seasons 1 3 gary william friedman served as the music director of the series for season 4 writing some 40 songs including the popular spider man theme song tom lehrer wrote ten songs for the series l y and silent e are among the more memorable dave conner was the music director of the last two seasons of the series clark gesner wrote several songs for the series including most of the sign songs but never served as the show s music director the original soundtrack album won a grammy award for the show s cast visuals the series was notable for its extensive innovative use of early computer generated imagery especially scanimation a then state of the art analog video synthesizer system they were often used for presenting words with particular sounds sometimes a cast member would be seen alongside or interacting in another way with one for instance june angela in a cute costume was shown dancing alongside the word tap the font featured for most of the words displayed on screen is franklin gothic it was used for the entire series closing credits each show ended with one of the cast members announcing the electric company gets its power from the children s television workshop after the copyright notice the list of corporate sponsors would be flashed on the screen an instrumental version of the show s theme starting in 1973 and changed each season played beneath the music prior to this a specific musical score played during the corporate credits the corporate sponsors which included such entities as the ford foundation and the carnegie corporation of new york were flashed one or two at a time for the first five seasons and scrolled during the sixth season the actual corporate credits for all seasons production funding for the electric company is provided by the bureau of libraries and educational technology the national center for educational technology the united states office of education mobil oil corporation the department of health education and welfare pbs affiliated stations unrestricted general program grants from the corporation for public broadcasting and the ford foundation and by a grant from the carnegie corporation of new york friday closing credits as with most pbs children s related programming produced by ctw the friday episodes featured closing credits along with a full length version of the same music that played over the corporate credits list the video that played beneath the scrolling list of credits changed from season to season and were as follows season 1 skip hinnant in his love of chair character sitting completely still or doing some other action such as sleeping midway through the season the music changed from a full length instrumental specific to the corporate credits to an upbeat marching band type instrumental version of the show s theme the second theme ended with crashing sound effects momentarily startling the boy from his sleep season 2 cast members entering the room one by one the short circus dressed in marching band uniforms entered the room first followed by dual versions of the adults each actor in dual roles who entered as him herself along with the character he she is most noted for playing e g morgan freeman entering both as himself and as easy reader at the end of this sequence the last one in the room would close the door and the picture would break up in pieces and crash down other times a hammer would appear in the bottom right of the screen and hit it causing the same type of breakage the same instrumental theme from latter season 1 episodes was used season 3 begins with the short circus playing their musical instruments over a chroma key then walking off as they dance to the beat of the music about midway through came a montage of clips from various skits capped with a clip of paul the gorilla dancing across the screen the theme was rescored it had more of a rock feel thanks to a prominently heard electric guitar the corporate credits theme was a hybrid of the friday credits theme the first part and a slower tempoed instrumental version of the opening theme for the second half season 4 not featured on shortened episodes that aired on noggin or on either of the dvd sets but is believed to be clips from the spidey super stories skits the closing theme was again rescored for the first time since early in the series it was the same version used in the corporate credits and featured a moog synthesizer season 5 filmed clips of the short circus along with focus group clips from an elementary school and behind the scenes action from the teletape production studio another rescore of the theme could be heard with horns prominent this time to create a definite easy listening feel it was played at a slower tempo for the corporate credits this sequence was used as the opening of a 1975 documentary on the success of the series in schools that was included in the best of the electric company vol 2 dvd boxed set season 6 clips from classic skits sometimes tied together such as sneezing people coping with high wind gusts water etc once again the theme was rescored this time using a prominently heard moog synthesizer leading the acoustic instruments show numbering a total of 780 episodes were produced in the show s six season run 130 per season the first four seasons 1971 1975 were numbered 1 520 the season five shows 1975 1976 were numbered 1a 130a and the season six shows 1976 1977 were numbered 1b 130b this was done because these two seasons were designed as year long curriculum for schools starting with season 3 episode 261 a show s number would be presented in the sketch of the day teaser segment which would highlight a particular sketch that would be shown during that episode the voice of a cast member would say a variant of today on the electric company the so and so says censored and the action would freeze as the graphic of the word of the day or card with the word of the day printed on it became visible to viewers the censored words were replaced by a series of harsh electronic sounds that sounded something like a theremin played out of tune in the amount of syllables required for each word the still action would linger on the screen for several seconds then fade to black where the show number would become visible in a scanimate animation the next show teaser which was introduced in season 2 without music worked in the same way and usually used a different take of the music heard during the sketch of the day teaser except that there was no show number shown in season 6 the electronic sounds were made less harsh sounding in season 1 however after the title sequence the sound of a striking match would be heard and a fade up from black would reveal a hand holding a lit match and show x handwritten on a piece of paper that was placed in such a way so that it could blend with the surrounding objects in frame instead of the next show teaser ken roberts s voice could be heard saying and now the last word and the trademark light bulb would be shut off by a hand doing whatever the last word was in season 2 after the opening sequence the words the electric company would disappear from the familiar logo and the show number would appear in its place through the use of a scanimate animation and an electronic whooshing sound it is interesting to note that some episodes in seasons 3 5 have serious technical errors with either their sketch of the day teaser segments or their next show teaser segments which is probably because of the failure of the linear analog video editing equipment episodes that have these errors in their sketch of the day teasers include 1a 8a 15a and 60a sometimes the music starts too late ends too early or plays too long sometimes the video does not appear at all only a show number appears and only part of the teaser music plays sometimes the errors are negligible with the teaser music only playing a fraction of a second longer than usual for season 6 because the teaser music was changed to a shorter self contained composition these errors do not occur credits season 1 executive producer david d connell producers samuel y gibbon joan ganz

april 15 1977 the series continued on pbs in reruns until october 1985 with the final two seasons 1a 130a and 1b 130b shown in rotation these are the episodes that are the most familiar to viewers the earlier 1971 1975 shows did not resurface until january 31 1999 when the noggin network which was partly owned by sesame workshop at the time rebroadcasted the show as a result of its co ownership of the network a two hour feature length compilation special which was aired on tv land re introduced the series to a new generation whose parents grew up watching the show noggin ran 65 select episodes until 2003 when they were pulled from the program lineup because sesame workshop sold its half of the network to viacom which already owned the other half the shows were cut subtly to fit noggin s shorter running time and free up time for various interstitial segments produced for the network these deletions included the episode numbers the scanimate word animations the segments 15 seconds and shorter and the teasers for the next episodes in seasons 2 6 dvd releases the series was not seen since it was pulled from noggin s schedule until sesame workshop under license to shout factory and sony bmg music entertainment released a dvd boxed set on february 7 2006 the best of the electric company that included 20 uncut episodes from all six seasons plus outtakes and introductions and commentary by rita moreno and june angela due to the overwhelming and somewhat unexpected popularity of the initial dvd release a second boxed set was released on november 14 2006 the best of the electric company volume 2 this second volume contained 20 episodes from seasons 1 5 and a 30 minute documentary on the effects of in school viewings of the electric company from 1975 cast members luis avalos jim boyd judy graubart skip hinnant and hattie winston provided commentary and reflected on their years on the show however the original content of seven of the episodes presented in the second dvd set were altered in some cases material that was originally broadcast in a particular episode was removed completely while material from other episodes was included for example episode 60a which is included in the second boxed set originally contained the spider man episode spidey meets the prankster and used a scene from that sketch as the opening teaser the teaser was removed completely after the opening credits leaving only the episode number and at the start is an episode of the six dollar and thirty nine cent man which supposedly aired only during season 6 also removed following the letterman sketch in this episode is the clip of the short circus singing stop and a road runner wile e coyote cartoon clayton appears in this episode as well even though he supposedly only appeared in season 6 as well these altered episodes also contain special effects used to segue from one sketch to another that were not used in the show s original run the material seen in these altered episodes was not what was originally shown when the episodes were first broadcast it is believed that hese changes were probably made to avoid repeats of segments that were on the first dvd set but it is more likely that it is an issue over ownership rights the segments that were used to cover up the material that sesame workshop does not own were longer than the excised segments and the episodes were cut further to get them down to their required 28 minute length it is rumored that additional dvds may be produced in the future possible television revival in 2005 rumors surfaced that sesame workshop was planning a new version of the electric company if the plans go forward the updated revival could return to the airwaves in 2007 which will coincide with the 26th anniversary of the

 id=5537785 title mv george prince ferry disaster nonfiltered 1556 processed 1535 dbindex 1561577 on the morning of october 20 1976 the ferry george prince was struck by the norwegian tanker ss frosta which was traveling upriver on the mississippi river the collision occurred at mile post 120 8 above head of passes less than three quarters of a mile from the construction site of the bridge that would replace the ferry 7 years later the ferry was crossing from destrehan louisiana on the east bank to luling louisiana on the west bank ninety six passengers and crew were aboard the ferry when it was struck and seventy eight perished vessels involved luling destrehan ferry operations the luling destrehan ferry was one of three routes then operated by the louisiana department of highways district 2 the others were a pedestrian ferry between norco and taft and a vehicle ferry between edgard and reserve only the edgard reserve ferry operates today the ferry operated with two boats the ollie k wilds and the george prince the george prince was the larger and operated around the clock while the smaller boat only worked at peak hours during peak hours the ferries did not operate on a fixed schedule the ferry landings are pontoons connected to a shell road by a small ramp and are held in place by pilings in the river bottom the ferries made a figure 8 transit always running upriver when departing letting the current carry the boat downriver then turning upriver to land on the opposite bank the east bank ferry landing was situated between two busy grain elevators limiting the boats ability to maneuver and when ships were present obscuring the boats radar visibility was often limited by clouds of grain dust from transfer operations although no transfer was taking place the morning of the accident the motor vessel george prince the george prince was a ferry owned and operated by the louisiana department of highways originally built in 1937 at slidell la and converted for its final use at avondale la in 1969 the us coast guard ceased inspection and certification of the vessel at the request of the state of louisiana since it was a free ferry and was not carrying passengers for hire the coast guard complied with the request the george prince was 120 feet in length and 34 feet in breadth with a gross weight of 259 tons and powered by a 670 horsepower diesel engine she was equipped with two radar units although only one was turned on at the time of the accident her crew of five consisted of a pilot and engineer and three deckhands the entire crew of the george prince had duties while afloat none of these duties were to serve as lookout had there been a designated lookout there was no way for the lookout to communicate with the pilot except by hand signals the ss frosta history the ss frosta was a tanker ship built in 1961 in germany and owned by a s ludwig of bergen norway the frosta was 664 feet in length 90 feet in breadth with a gross weight of 22 850 tons and powered by a steam turbine engine rated at 16 800 horsepower transatlantic voyage and up the river the frosta departed empty from rotterdam holland on october 4 bound for baton rouge louisiana the voyage was uneventful at the southwest pass of the mississippi river on the night of october 19 the frosta took aboard her first of three pilots to guide her up the river the pilot at the time of the collision was nicholas colombo a member of the new orleans baton rouge steamship pilots association and the third pilot aboard the ship for the journey upstream colombo directed the ship take a speed equivalent to 12 miles per hour upstream his preferred speed the crew ordered a speed of half ahead which gave them a forward momentum of 11 4 mph stemming a current of 1 1 miles per hour when the ship was about a mile below the luling destrehan ferry crossing the pilot spotted a ferry cross from the west bank to the east bank of the river this was the mv ollie k wilds which worked the route with the george prince at this time the ship was on the west side of the channel and was passing two ships moored to grain elevators on the east bank of the river the collision george prince at about 6 00 on the morning the george prince was berthed at the east bank landing taking on vehicles she was facing upriver and took on a full load of vehicles consisting of 20 cars 8 trucks 6 motorcycles and an unknown number of pedestrians of the passengers aboard there is no accounting of people in vehicles versus pedestrians about 20 people were crowded in a waiting room to avoid the pre dawn chill once loaded the george prince departed and made a short run upriver before turning to cross the river she did not give any indication of her departure by radio or horn when operating in tandem the ferries operated by sight with each other the george prince proceeded across the river never changing course nor acknowledging radio traffic according to the survivors some of the passengers were aware of the frosta as it traveled upriver and there was a growing anxiety over what appeared to be a collision course although this anxiety was somewhat tempered by their belief that the ferry would maneuver to avoid the ship especially since there was no indication of danger from the george prince when the frosta sounded the danger signal there was an immediate panic from those who could see the ship and their flight from danger alerted others to what point the passengers on the side opposite the ship were aware of the danger can never be known as all the survivors were on the side of the impact when the ferry had nearly finished its voyage across the river she was struck near the middle of the port side by the bow of the frosta the force of the collision drove the stem of the frosta 8 feet into the side impaled on the port side and being pushed sideways up the river the starboard side of the george prince was quickly submerged and the vessel capsized almost immediately after capsizing the ferry was driven under the ship where the bottoms of the vessels collided all the vehicles were thrown off of the deck except for a motorcycle which was entangled in the railing one vehicle floated briefly before filling with water and sinking the rest sank immediately less than two minutes had elapsed since departing the dock ss frosta with the east bank ferry landing obstructed by ships the frosta could not see any activity at the landing until a quarter mile away at the point of collision though the river is more than half a mile wide having spotted the oscar k wilds crossing the pilot was aware of the ferry operation the pilot observed a ferry depart the east bank landing heading upriver he called twice on his hand held transceiver waiting ample time between transmissions for a reply but receiving none he blew the ship s horn twice indicating his desire to pass in front of the ferry while the two blast signal had no standing or meaning according to the western river rules of the road it was commonly understood at the time for the ferry to give way and allow the ship to pass at the time of the horn signal the ferry had already turned to port beginning to cross the river and was less than a quarter mile away the ferry did not respond and the pilot again called on the radio and repeated the two blast signal on the ship s horn the ferry still did not respond and proceeded directly in the path of the frosta at this point the pilot began continuous radio calls and horn blasts he also ordered the frosta full astern the pilot made no attempt to turn the ship though recall that he was traveling on the west side of the channel this gave him no choice but to turn the ship to the starboard which had the ferry turned would have meant that the ship turned toward the ferry the pilot also feared striking a bridge pier construction site just upriver or running aground or into one of the ships docked at the grain elevator the ferry was on a constant bearing less than 500 feet away when it passed out of sight of the frosta s bridge crew the crew felt a slight bump as the ship collided with the ferry the ferry rolled off the bow of the ship to the starboard side then rolled under emerging on the ship s port side 275 yards from the bank as the ferry came into view it was nearly totally capsized a vehicle was seen floating down the river with its headlights still on before filling with water and sinking the pilot ordered all stop on the engines to avoid hazarding any survivors with a churning propeller the captain of the ship and the pilot both called for assistance from any vessel in the area and notified the coast guard the ship maneuvered through the construction area and anchored midstream over a mile upriver carried most of this way by forward momentum once anchored frosta launched two of her life boats in a futile attempt to rescue survivors none of the crew of the ship ever saw any survivors in the water rescue and recovery rescue a total of 18 passengers survived the collision passengers who were able to see downstream became aware of the rapidly closing motions of the vessels and rightly concluded that the collision was imminent fourteen of the survivors were thrown clear and surfaced without difficulty three others were briefly trapped under the george prince the last survivor had run back to his vehicle thinking he would be safer in his truck after the collision he managed to escape his sinking vehicle through a window only one survivor had a life jacket before going into the water but had not had time to put it on two others found life jackets floating in the river which they used for a short time but neither man had time to properly don the life jackets aboard the ollie k wilds the crew in the pilot house did not see the collison as they were preparing to offload vehicles an engineer burst through the door saying a passenger saw a ship run over the ferry the captain of the ferry immediately ordered his vessel to cast off having offloaded just one of his 15 vehicle load he contacted the pilot of the frosta and asked him if the ferry had sunk he went in front of me and i ran him over was the pilot s reply a st charles parish sheriff s deputy who had ridden aboard the ollie k wilds used a radio aboard to report the collision to his dispatcher in hahnville and requested assistance the ollie k wilds proceeded across the river cautiously so as to not run over any survivors as the ferries touched passengers bridged the gap with benches from the waiting room and sixteen survivors perched on the overturned hull came across to safety as the ollie k wilds was crossing the river a deck hand and the deputy had launched the small rescue boat they pulled one survivor from the water the tugboat mv alma s was preparing to help turn one of the ships at the grain elevator he heard the frosta s pilot making the emergency calls and heard the horn sounding the crew cast off from the ship and proceeded slowly across the river toward the overturned ferry with the survivors standing on the hull fifteen yards from the george prince the crew heard a man call for help the crew threw a life ring to him and pulled him aboard all the survivors were taken to the west bank ferry landing for the expected arrival of aid all the passengers were taken to hospitals and had stays in the hospital of at least 72 hours recovery the coast guard immediately notified of the collision from the frantic radio calls dispatched helicopters to the scene one helicopter stopped at lakefront airport to pick up a diving team the divers were airborne at 7 14 and arrived at 7 25 they were on the vessel at 7 34 they checked for survivors by tapping on the hull with no response at 8 33 they reported that there were no signs of life and that other divers were needed to search inside the hull for bodies having heard news media reports of the tragedy a professional dive team drove themselves to the site and offered assistance being commercial divers they were equipped with air line masks instead of tanks and were much less restricted in their movements they were also accustomed to working in the blackout conditions of the river large amounts of sediment obscure any vision in the river the dive team recovered nine bodies from the passenger compartment of the george prince two more were recovered from the pilot house the engine room held five bodies one was found in a bathroom doorway and another was found in a storeroom fifty seven bodies and a portion of another were found in submerged vehicles as they were recovered from the river bottom between october 23 and october 27 1976 one body was found in the river on may 22 1977 salvage investigation salvage coordination and responsibility for salvage of the george prince and her vehicles was assumed by the state s director of administration charles roemer ii father of future governor buddy roemer that afternoon a crane barge arrived on scene and prepared to right and raise the ferry which by now rested on the river bottom near the west bank with the hull barely protruding from the water overnight the ferry was turned over by the salvage crew the next morning lifting operations began and continued late into the night at 10 00 p m the ferry was raised enough to permit dewatering operations and the river reopened to limited marine traffic the ferry was towed to the louisiana department of highways yard in plaquemine la for further investigation the damage was deemed irreparable and the george prince never sailed again investigation investigators used the weather conditions from moisant international airport now louis armstrong new orleans international airport less than seven miles away conditions there were recorded as a clear crisp pre dawn darkness without fog haze or other local environmental impairment to visibility winds were from the north northeast at 13 knots with gusts to 20 knots the river conditions were measured at the carrollton gauge eighteen miles downriver maximum velocity was 1 5 miles per hour with average velocity of 1 16 mph and the river was 2 feet above sea level once it was raised coast guard officials from the marine investigation office boarded the ferry and examined the pilot house one of the radar sets was off another was on the radio was turned on and tuned to channel 13 the same channel used by the river pilot a plywood box was found in the pilot house containing various logbooks and other documents along with a half pint bottle of seagrams v o whiskey with about an inch of whiskey remaining no fingerprints could be recovered from the bottle despite the efforts of the fbi lab in washington dc the body of the ferry pilot was autopsied by orleans parish coroner dr frank minyard the blood alcohol level was determined to be 0 09 just shy of the legal definition of intoxication of 0 10 no other drugs were present minyard s report stated that auletta had been drinking and was experiencing some degree of impairment at the time of his death at the helm conclusions of the investigation findings regarding the ferry from the coast guard investigation report the george prince under the control of egidio auletta departed and turned almost immediately to cross the river because the current was slow and the volume of automobile traffic made it attractive to cross as quickly as possible the departure into stream traffic created a situation where risk of collision could exist but did not signal his intent to cross the river by radio or horn had he announced his departure with the proper signal and signaled his intent to cross in front of the frosta he would have made a rude but acceptable crossing of the river due to complacency fatigue and or the effects of alcohol auletta failed to detect the approaching ship until the final seconds before collision when she disappeared from the view of the frosta s pilot by which time the collision was inevitable the investigators concluded that he had time to maneuver to lessen the collision by making it a glancing blow but the forward momentum and downstream current made the collision beyond human remedy the primary cause of the tragedy was the navigation of george prince into the channel without due regard to or awareness of river traffic and the risk of collision the investigators stated that they could not imagine a more vivid example to prove that keeping a proper lookout is the first rule of seamanship there was evidence of numerous violations on the part of egidio auletta they are failure to sound a horn upon departing a dock failure to keep a proper lookout failure to slacken speed or if necessary stop and reverse when approaching another vessel so as to avoid risk of collision failure to signal intentions when crossing failure to navigate with caution until danger of collision is over use of a vessel in a negligent manner so as to endanger life limb and property findings regarding the pilot again from the coast guard report frosta s pilot nicholas colombo correctly assessed the risk of collision and sought agreement on a safe passage for both vessels local custom was for small vessels to give way to large vessels in stream traffic due to the relative difficulty in maneuvering ships in the channel but could not absolve him of the legal requirement to yield to traffic approaching from his starboard according to the investigators this casualty is a classic example of the tragic consequences which can result from conflict between established custom and the law when each mandates a different response by the persons involved after sighting the ollie k wilds cross colombo the frosta s pilot made numerous attempts to contact the ferry and saw the george prince turn into his path immediately after departure as the ferry continued into harm s way failing to respond to the attempts to make contact colombo did not order a reduction in speed or reversal of engine until less than a minute before collision and the ship finally responded to the full astern order with barely 15 seconds before striking the ferry having chosen first to follow custom and then failing to make contact colombo should have considered the george prince unresponsive and acted quickly and decisively to avert a collision altering course colombo did not consider any turn to starboard practical if he made a slight turn to starboard and the ferry responded according to practice to yield to the larger vessel then he would have turned toward the ferry and a collision if he made a radical turn to starboard he would have been in jeopardy of collision with the moored at the grain elevator he also did not consider a turn to port since the ship was already favoring that side of the channel there was little room to turn therefore colombo was forced to continue ahead altering speed given the bulk of the ship and the time it would take to make an appreciable change in speed the option to accelerate from the setting of half ahead to full ahead would have been futile colombo was obliged to slow frosta given the close quarters for any reduction in speed to be effective it would have to be applied quickly if he had decisively slowed the frosta after not receiving a response to his first call the collision could have been avoided or lessened and the panel deemed this the prudent response the panel concluded that colombo navigated the ss frosta in a negligent manner findings regarding the ss frosta s captain the captain of the frosta kjell sletten was supervising his vessel s journey upriver via periodic visits to the pilothouse observations he made by looking out his cabin window and by the presence of his mate peder gasvaer who was on the bridge the mate was responsible to call the captain to the bridge in a situation that required his presence although such situations were not defined the mate did not notify sletten until the sounding of the danger signal and the order for full astern seconds before the collision the panel concluded that although the bridge watch was not deficient had the mate called for the captain earlier that the captain may have had a lower threshold for the ferry s actions and might have acted sooner a master of the ship can delegate but does not abdicate responsibility for safe navigation to the mate therefore as captain sletten is ultimately responsible for the safe navigation of the frosta the panel concluded that sletten allowed the frosta to be used in a negligent manner miscellaneous findings the 18 persons who never escaped from the interior of the george prince drowned almost immediately as the interior flooded through numerous openings in the hull including doors and windows there was not sufficient air trapped in the hull to sustain life most of the people who died were trapped under the overturned hull or in their vehicles and could not find a clear path to the surface an unknown number may have reached the surface but because of injuries or inability to swim did not survive there is no evidence of equipment or material failure of either vessel which caused or contributed to the tragedy life saving equipment provided aboard the george prince was of little use in this accident life jackets are designed to aid in escaping a vessel which is slowly sinking not the sudden collision and immediate capsizing which occurred which was beyond the scope of the life saving equipment available life jackets floating free in the river did aid two people remain afloat and reaching the safety of the overturned ferry the rescue boat of the ollie k wilds served its designed purpose that is rescue of a few individuals from the river it could not have coped with a large number of survivors in the water if for instance the overturned ferry did not remain afloat the response of the ollie k wilds commercial towboats and the local coast guard units was commendable had ferry not overturned so rapidly their immediate response would have been instrumental in saving a number of lives unfortunately the first rescuers were only able to find and rescue two survivors from the river other survivors made their way onto the overturned hull coast guard commandant s remarks circumstances of the collision prevent the usual application of the western rivers rules of the road which state that a vessel to the starboard has right of way thus the red light facing to port and the green light facing to starboard george prince was expected to do one of three things head down river to pass behind the frosta slow and or stop midstream and wait for the frosta to pass or proceed directly across to the west bank only two minutes elapsed between the departure of the ferry and the collision since there was doubt as to the intention of the george prince and there was no response to attempts to determine the ferry s intentions the duty of the pilot of the frosta was to immediately reverse engine and sound the danger signal the george prince proceeded across the busy waterway apparently oblivious to the imminent danger auletta apparently never sighted the frosta never heard the radio calls or horn signals a reasonably alert pilot would have seen the ship coming upriver even though a strict application of the rules of the road gave the george prince the right of way this of course does not give the right to proceed into harm s way without taking any evasive maneuvers neither vessel took any early or substantial action to avoid the collision auletta s judgement and reaction were certainly impaired by the 0 09 blood alcohol content although to what degree can not be known although three areas have been well established as effected by alcohol levels under 0 10 steadiness orientation and balance attention memory and information processing peripheral vision and visual field in this circustance the ability of the eyes to adjust to darkness to detect moving targets at low levels of illumination and mental attentiveness are all effected the commandant states it is imperative that the deck watch of any vessel be in complete control of his faculties and the evidence shows that auletta was not in control of his faculties as it is inconceivable that such an experienced mariner could either ignore or fail to see the frosta unless his faculties were impaired the captain of the ollie k wilds stated that the windows of his pilot house were closed and that he did not hear the frosta s horn a previous accident involving the george prince followed a similar scenario on that occasion the captain of the ferry stated that he did not hear the sounding of vehicle horns or the shouts of passengers the morning of the accident the windows were likely closed and this may have prevented auletta from hearing the frosta s horn therefore it is imperative that a lookout be designated and posted outside to listen for and relay signals from other vessels closing of the ferry with the opening of the destrehan luling bridge in october 1983 barely a mile upstream from the ferry landings the ferry ceased operations at the

opportunity for a military base to benefit the economy of southwestern new brunswick the area under consideration was an expansive plateau west of the st john river between the cities of saint john and fredericton measuring approximately 60 km in length and 40 km in width more accurately it runs between oromocto in the north to welsford in the south and between the st john river in the east and the south branch of the oromocto river in the west over 900 families inhabited the area living in dozens of active vibrant rural communities primarily engaged in agriculture and forestry industries the terrain was variable providing mixed acadian forest swamp and marshland as well as open farming areas similar to the northern european plain the influence of the st croix highlands part of the appalachian mountain range creates hilly terrain and valleys in the southern and western part of the region close to the nerepis and oromocto rivers the expropriation of lands began in the early 1950s much to the surprise of local residents who had been kept in the dark about the expropriation until the last minute the base was surveyed so as to not affect some of the historic communities along the western bank of the st john river such as gagetown hampstead and browns flat the expropriation began several kilometres west of the river and eliminated the communities of petersville hibernia new jerusalem and many others this remains the largest single land expropriation in the history of new brunswick and is still a subject of rancour for those families removed from their historic homes and communities the base headquarters were chosen for the northern part of the base adjacent to the small then village of oromocto in preparation for the influx of service personnel oromocto was redesigned as a planned town with buried electrical utilities and residential and commercial clustering typical of larger planned towns such as richmond hill ontario oromocto s futuristic design became a source of conversation throughout the centuries old loyalist towns and villages spread throughout the st john river valley construction of the base facilities in oromocto benefitted from convenient railway connections provided by canadian national and canadian pacific railways a new alignment of the trans canada highway was built on the eastern bank of the st john river opposite from oromocto in the early 1960s see new brunswick highway 2 and a new highway bridge across the st john river connected the trans canada highway to the village of burton just south of oromocto and near the east gate for the base the gagetown military camp or camp gagetown opened in 1956 and was named after the village of gagetown although the base was located west of this historic village and was headquartered 25 miles to its north in oromocto an act that has caused no end of confusion over the years the base s territory measured 1 129 km² and included numerous live fire ranges for infantry armoured and artillery units as well as aerial weapons ranges at the time of its opening in 1956 until the opening of cfb suffield in 1971 camp gagetown was the largest military training facility in canada and the entire commonwealth of nations by comparison suffield has 2 690 km² with 2 270 km² usable by the military and 420 km² designated as a national wildlife refuge operations initially camp gagetown was the home base for many army regiments including the black watch and the royal canadian regiment however defence cutbacks in the 1960s saw a gradual reduction and the demise of their parent formation 3 brigade group on february 1 1968 the canadian army the royal canadian air force and the royal canadian navy were merged to form the canadian armed forces following this unification camp gagetown was renamed canadian forces base gagetown cfb gagetown the training area was subject to tests by the us armed forces of the defoliants agent orange and agent purple during the 1960s which has lead to an inquiry as to its long term effects upon the soldiers and civilian base personnel which were exposed to it in the post unification armed forces cfb gagetown functioned as the primary combat training centre for force mobile command renamed land force command in the 1990s in the early 1970s cfb gagetown began to simultaneously refer to itself as combat training centre gagetown ctc gagetown referring to its comprehensive artillery armour infantry and engineer training schools which were relocated from elsewhwere a role that continues to the present day many still refer to it as camp gagetown or home of the army due to the history and current involvement with land forces increased defence spending in the 1980s saw numerous new training facilities built and ranges modernized and this continued into the 1990s as the canadian forces closed obsolete bases cfb gagetown continues to function as the army s primary training facility although due to risk of forest fires in recent years live fire training has been pushed primarily to the fall winter spring seasons trivia cfb gagetown is often referred to as gag town by soldiers who train at or are posted to the base the training area is also referred to as the only place in the world where one can find swamps at the top of hills the training area has been heavily landscaped over the years by military

 id=491986 title common bean nonfiltered 1567 processed 1546 dbindex 1561588 the common bean phaseolus vulgaris indigenous to the americas is an herbaceous annual plant domesticated independently in ancient mesoamerica and the andes and now grown worldwide for its edible bean popular both dry and as a green bean the leaf is occasionally used as a leaf vegetable and the straw is used for fodder botanically the common bean is classified as a dicotyledon beans squash and maize comprised the three sisters that provided the foundation of native american agriculture as a legume beans provided the nitrogen fixing bacteria which supplied that essential nutrient to the other two crops description the common bean is a highly variable species bush varieties form erect bushes 20 60 cm tall while pole or running varieties form vines 2 3 m long all varieties bear alternate green or purple leaves divided into three oval smooth edged leaflets each 6 15 cm long and 3 11 cm wide the white pink or purple flowers are about 1 cm long and give way to pods 8 20 cm long 1 1 5 cm wide green yellow black or purple in color each containing 4 6 beans the beans are smooth plump kidney shaped up to 1 5 cm long range widely in color and are often mottled in two or more colors as the common bean is a dicot it germinates as such the primary root emerges through the seed coats while the seed is still buried in the soil the hypocotyl emerges from the seed coats and pushes its way up through the soil it is bent in a hairpin shape the hypocotyl arch crozier s hook as it grows up the two cotyledons protect the epicotyl structures the plumule from mechanical damage once the hypocotyl arch emerges from the soil it straightens out this response is triggered by light phototropism both red light absorbed by phytochrome and blue light absorbed by cryptochrome can do the job the cotyledons spread apart exposing the epicotyl consisting of two primary leaves and the apical meristem in many dicots the cotyledons not only supply their food stores to the developing plant but also turn green and make more food by photosynthesis until they drop off nutrition and preparation toxicity before they are eaten the raw bean seeds should be boiled for at least ten minutes to degrade a toxic compound the lectin phytohaemagglutinin found in the bean which would otherwise cause severe gastric upset this compound is present in many varieties and in some other species of bean but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans although in the case of dry beans the ten minutes required to degrade the toxin is much shorter than the hours required to fully cook the beans themselves outbreaks of poisoning have been associated with the use of slow cookers whose low cooking temperatures may be unable to degrade the toxin sprouts of pulses high in haemaglutins should not be eaten red kidney beans especially should not be sprouted dry beans similar to other beans the common bean is high in starch protein and dietary fiber and an excellent source of iron potassium selenium molybdenum thiamine vitamin b6 and folic acid dry beans will keep indefinitely if stored in a cool dry place but as time passes their nutritive value and flavor degrades and cooking times lengthen dried beans are almost always cooked by boiling often after having been soaked for several hours while the soaking step is not necessary it shortens cooking time somewhat and results in a more evenly textured pot of beans in addition discarding one or more soaking waters leaches out hard to digest complex sugars that can cause flatulence there are several methods the power soak method is to boil beans for three minutes then set aside 2 4 hours then drain and discard water and proceed with cooking common beans take longer to cook than most pulses cooking times vary from one to four hours but are substantially reduced with pressure cooking the traditional spice to use with beans is epazote which is also said to aid digestion and kombu a type of seaweed can be added to beans as they cook to improve their digestion as well salt sugar and acidic foods like tomatoes will harden uncooked beans and therefore should be added last after the beans have been completely cooked dry beans may also be bought pre cooked and canned as refried beans or whole with water salt and sometimes sugar green beans green common beans are also called string beans stringless beans depending on whether the pod has a tough fibrous string running along its length or snap beans compared to the dry beans they provide less starch and protein and more vitamin a and vitamin c the green beans are often steamed stir fried or baked in casseroles shelling beans as with other beans prominently among them lima beans soybeans

criticism channel one has been controversial largely due to the commercial content of the show critics claim that it is a problem in classrooms because it consumes class time and forces commercial activity in a public domain supporters argue that the ads are necessary to help keep the program running and provide free tvs vcrs and satellite dishes to schools as well as commercial free educational video through channel one connection channel one also airs commercials such as military recruitment in high schools and cell phone ads another criticism noted by media education foundation s documentary captive audience is that very little time is dedicated to actual news and the majority of the programming is soft sensationalistic fluff with corporate marketing and pr tie ins to promote products and services arguing that it further corrupts the school setting with consumerism channel one s contract with schools requires that the program be shown to students on 90 of all regular school days at some schools teachers are allowed to preview the show and decide if they want to show it or not however they must still show it at least 90 of the time some believe this is too strict the teachers are also instructed to make sure students watch the complete program and leave the volume at an audible level throughout the whole program including the advertising content however according to critics many schools do not follow the contract verbatim and let the teachers decide whether or not it should be shown channel one s home state of new york has banned channel one news

 id=190186 title symphony no 2 mahler nonfiltered 1578 processed 1557 dbindex 1561599 the symphony no 2 in c minor by gustav mahler known as the resurrection was written between 1888 and 1894 apart from the eighth symphony this symphony is one of mahler s most popular and successful works the work has a duration of about eighty to ninety minutes origin the symphony began life as totenfeier funeral rites a one movement symphonic poem based on an epic poem by adam mickiewicz which mahler completed in 1888 later he returned to the movement and added three others so that by late 1893 the first four movements of the symphony as we now know it were complete he then set the work aside for a while aware that it needed something else to complete it but lacking inspiration as to what that something else might be in 1894 the conductor hans von bülow died and mahler went to his funeral there he heard a setting of friedrich gottlieb klopstock s die auferstehung the resurrection and this inspired him to complete his symphony with a massive choral movement with text based on klopstock s poem die auferstehung is not as is commonly believed one of klopstock s odes but is instead part of a set of poems which he called geseimtliche leider spiritual songs mahler devised a narrative programme for the work which he told to a number of friends he did not approve of audiences being made aware of it but it is often recounted nowadays in this programme the first movement represents a funeral and asks questions such as is there life after death the second movement is a remembrance of happy times in the life of the deceased the third movement represents a complete loss of faith and belief in life as meaningless the fourth movement a song is a rebirth of faith i am from god and will return to god and the fifth movement after a return of the doubts of the third movement and the questions of the first ends with a realization of god s love and recognition of everlasting life publication the work was first published in 1897 by friedrich hofmeister the rights were transferred to josef weinberger shortly thereafter and finally to universal edition which released a second edition in 1910 a third edition was published in 1952 and a fourth critical edition in 1970 both by universal edition as part of the new complete critical edition of mahler s symphonies being undertaken by the gustav mahler society a new critical edition of the second symphony is due to be released in late 2007 as a joint venture between universal edition and the kaplan foundation reproductions of earlier editions have been released by dover and by boosey hawkes the kaplan foundation published an extensive facsimile edition with additional materials in 1986 instrumentation the symphony is written for an orchestra a mixed choir two soloists and an offstage ensemble of brass and percussion woodwinds 4 flutes all four doubling 4 piccolos 4 oboes two doubling 2 english horns 3 clarinets in b flat a c one doubling bass clarinet 2 e flat clarinets one doubling clarinet both doubled in ff where possible 3 bassoons contrabassoon doubling bassoon brass 10 horns four used

triangles one offstage snare drum more than one where possible glockenspiel 3 bells steel rods with deep unpitched sound 2 bass drums one offstage rute or switch to be played on the bass drum 2 tam tams high and low keyboards organ voices soprano solo used in fifth movement only alto solo used in fourth fifth movements only choir used in fifth movement only strings harps i ii several to a part the largest possible contingent of strings first and second violins violas violoncellos double basses form the work in its finished form has five movements allegro maestoso andante moderato in ruhig fliessender bewegung with quietly flowing movement urlicht primeval light in tempo des scherzos in the tempo of the scherzo first movement musically the first movement though passing through a number of different moods often resembles a funeral march and is violent and angry it is in a very extended sonata form the form of this movement is still debated it is undoubtedly in an extended sonata form and organization of the final section beginning with the recapitulation just after rehearsal 20 is clear the first theme group includes the bass theme that opens the movement and the dirge in the woodwinds that follows and the second theme group is introduced in the distant key of e major in the violins at rehearsal 3 after this it is difficult to say whether there is a second exposition a large development section or two or some combination thereof one possible reading has two expositions the second one beginning at rehearsal 4 and a long development section beginning after rehearsal 9 the development presents several ideas that will be used later in the symphony including a theme based on the dies irae plainchant mahler uses a somewhat modified tonal framework for the movement the secondary theme first presented in e major begins its second statement in c major a key in which it is not expected until the recapitulation the statement in the recapitulation ironically is in the original e major the eventual goal of the symphony e flat major is briefly hinted at after rehearsal 17 with a theme in the trumpets that returns in the finale following this movement mahler calls in the score for a gap of five minutes before the second movement this pause is rarely followed today often conductors will meet mahler half way pausing for roughly two and a half minutes or so while the chorus that is used in later movements files in second movement the second movement is a delicate ländler with two contrasting sections of slightly darker music this slow movement itself is contrasting to the two adjacent movements structurally it is one of mahler s simplest movements in his whole output third movement the third movement is a scherzo based on the music of mahler s des knaben wunderhorn song about st anthony preaching to the fishes des antonius von padua fischpredigt it opens with two strong short timpani strokes it is followed by two softer strokes then followed by even softer strokes that provide the tempo to this movement mahler called the climax of the movement which occurs near the end sometimes a cry of despair and sometimes a death shriek fourth movement the fourth movement urlicht is another wunderhorn song actually sung this time by an alto who mahler requests should sound like a small child in heaven this is a surprisingly short movement almost acting like an introduction to the giant last movement fifth movement the finale is the longest typically lasting over half an hour it is divided into two large parts the second of which begins with the entry of the chorus and whose form is governed by the text of this movement the first part is instrumental and very episodic containing a wide variety of moods tempi and keys with much of the material based on what has been heard in the previous movements although it also loosely follows sonata principles new themes introduced are used repeatedly and altered the movement opens with a long introduction beginning with the cry of despair that was the climax of the third movement followed by the quiet presentation of a theme which re appears as structural music in the choral section and by a call in the offstage horns the first theme group reiterates the dies irae theme from the first movement and then introduces the resurrection theme to which the chorus will sing their first words and finally a fanfare the second theme is a long orchestral recitative which provides the music for the alto solo in the choral section the exposition concludes with a re statement of the first theme group this long opening section serves to introduce a number of themes which will become important in the choral part of the finale the development section is what mahler calls the march of the dead in addition to developing the dies irae and resurrection themes and motives from the opening cry of despair this section also states episodically a number of other themes based on earlier material the recapitulation overlaps with the march and only brief statements of the first theme group are re stated the orchestral recitative is fully recapitulated and is accompanied this time by offstage interruptions from a band of brass and percussion this builds to a climax which leads into a re statement of the opening introductory section the horn call is expanded into mahler s great summons a transition into the choral section tonally this first large part the instrumental half of the movement is organized in f minor after the introduction which recalls two keys from earlier movements the first theme group is presented wholly in f minor and the second theme group in the subdominant b flat minor the re statement of the first theme group occurs in the dominant c major the development explores a number of keys including the mediant a flat major and the parallel major f major unlike the first movement the second theme is recapitulated as expected in the tonic key the re statement of the introduction is thematically and tonally a transition to the second large part moving from c sharp minor to the parallel d flat major the dominant of f sharp minor in which the great summons is stated the choral section begins in g flat major the chorus comes in quietly a little past the half way point of the movement the choral section is organized primarily by the text using musical material from earlier in the movement each of the first two verses is followed by an instrumental interlude the alto and soprano solos o glaube based on the recitative melody precede the fourth verse sung by the chorus and the fifth verse is a duet for the two soloists the opening two verses are presented in g flat major the solos and the fourth verse in b flat minor the key in which the recitative was originally stated and the duet in a flat major the goal of the symphony e flat major the relative major of the opening c minor is achieved when the chorus picks up the words from the duet mit flügeln and the final verse and instrumental coda are in this ultimate key this tremendous finale is overwhelmingly powerful in effect text note this text has been translated from the original german to english on a very literal and line for line basis without regard for the preservation of meter or rhyming patterns fourth movement text from des knaben wunderhorn original german urlicht o röschen rot der mensch liegt in größter not der mensch liegt in größter pein je lieber möcht ich im himmel sein da kam ich auf einen breiten weg da kam ein engelein und wollt mich abweisen ach nein ich ließ mich nicht abweisen ich bin von gott und will wieder zu gott der liebe gott wird mir ein lichtchen geben wird leuchten mir bis in das ewig selig leben in english primeval light o red

from god and will return to god the dear god will give me a little light which will light my way to eternal blessed life fifth movement note the first eight lines were taken from the poem die auferstehung by friedrich gottlieb klopstock mahler omitted the final four lines of this poem and wrote the rest himself beginning at o glaube original german aufersteh n ja aufersteh n wirst du mein

1931 london conducted by bruno walter trivia the symphony was a favorite of pope john paul ii the use of a chorus in this last movement has led to comparisons with ludwig van beethoven s symphony no 9 this comparison is supported also by the opening of the last movement which like beethoven s symphony contains references to music from earlier movements otto klemperer s famous recording clocks to 79 minutes despite his reputation for using slow tempos leonard bernstein s two well known recordings of the work take 85 and 93 minutes respectively among performances the amateur conductor gilbert kaplan has a renowned interpretation as he carried out extensive research into the symphony the third movement of luciano berio s sinfonia 1968 69 is based on the third movement of this symphony the b flat below the bass clef occurs four times in the bass part three at the chorus hushed entrance into the symphony and again on the words hör auf zu beben it is the lowest vocal note in standard classical repertoire mahler instructs that any basses incapable of singing the note remain silent rather than sing the note an octave higher interestingly mahler used two tam tams one high and one low instead of his usual one the effect of this difference is clearly heard in the final measures of the symphony when mahler repeatedly uses the tam tams in alternation in 1899 an arrangement by bruno

michigan it is considered to be a magnet school and it maintains high test scores in the mid michigan tri cities region enrollment is approximately 600 students overall sasa s concentration program is unusual even for a magnet school middle school concentration programs include global studies language arts voice keyboard 2 d art 3 d art dance math science high school concentrations include global studies math science language arts voice keyboard 2 d art 3 d art dance and theatre due to budget cuts the middle school theater concentration has been suspended for an unknown duration but it may be reinstated by the 2006 07 school year in a statement released by the principal history the saginaw arts sciences academy is located in a building that originally housed a montgomery ward department store in the early 1980s the school district of the city of saginaw purchased the building and announced plans to convert it into a half day specialized high school and middle school program for advanced students called the center for the arts sciences cas at the time the announcement was made to the local press district spokesman michael manley recalled that discarded mannequins still filled the building new dividing walls were constructed to create classrooms although the fact that the building was originally a department store is still somewhat apparent especially due to the lack of windows during the 1980s and 1990s the cas shared its building with the ruben daniels center for lifelong education an adult and alternative high school also run by the saginaw school district the cas met with surprising success and began drawing students from throughout the saginaw valley area including saginaw bay and midland counties in the late 1990s a committee of students parents and teachers began a campaign to expand the school to include a full day option this committee took on the name the river school project owing to the school s location on the banks of the saginaw river near downtown saginaw although the committee met with much doubt and resistance support gradually built and after several meetings the saginaw school board eventually unanimously approved plans to expand the school and change the name to the saginaw arts sciences academy in 1999 full day programs were added for the 9th and 10th grade with the 11th grade following in 2000 and the 12th grade in 2001 the school initially had far fewer full day students than half day but since the early days of the full day program full time enrollment has greatly expanded the history of cas sasa would not be complete without the mention of outstanding principal mr birdsall during the nineties u of m alum mr birdsall would strike awe in the hearts of the incoming students during his welcoming speech he emphasized respect and once he retired the halls of cas sasa seemed to get a little louder a little rowdier he also ran driver s ed on the site during the summer accolades sasa students have repeatedly performed well in standardized tests art sciences math and more sasa typically has a handful of students represented at the intel international science and engineering fair every year and the school has produced two grand award winners as well as dozens of students who have placed at isef in the 2001 teams engineering competition sasa s team scored highest nationally the school has well regarded math competition teams and participation in certain competitions such as the american mathematics contest and the michigan mathematics prize competition is mandatory for all students in the math science concentration the school s model united nations club one of the longest running organizations at the school has become very successful recently in the past two years sasamun has won 7 best delegate awards and 6 best delegation awards at regional national conferences the school s arts programs are especially well designed and developed and usually send an impressive delegation to the michigan youth arts festival and several of the school s visual artists have won national art competitions finally the school publishes an annual literary magazine icons which is edited and run entirely by students icons has won numerous awards of excellence from columbia scholastic press sasa is the site of the saginaw county science and engineering fair participation in this event is a requirement for students in the math science concentration but other students may apply if they wish student culture the sasa student body is extremely diverse there are students from both working class and wealthy families and the school s racial makeup is also very mixed sasa draws students from both the east and west sides of saginaw city traditionally the province of saginaw high school and arthur hill high school respectively as well as outlying suburbs and the cities of bay city and midland to name only a few the school s athletics programs are limited in scope but have grown in recent years to affiliate with the inter state athletic conference isac for varsity boys and girls sports in basketball and soccer and girls volleyball for some major sports including football and baseball students elect to attend sasa for the half day program and play on their home school s team recent changes in policy in the saginaw public school district have been met with various attitudes from sasa students a recent amendment to the district dress code policy has altered the usual lax environment to a business casual code the proscription of hooded sweatshirts hoodies and compulsory tucking have been met with resistance however it appears that academic resolve remains supreme student life has advanced well beyond the originating days of sasa while it once was a unique school several teachers students and administrators have been trying to create sasa into a real school this has been done by adding several things a real school would have a winter formal dance held in february of 2006

church early christianity the bulgarian orthodox church has its origin in the flourishing christian communities and churches set up in the balkans as early as the first centuries of the christian era christianity was brought to the bulgarian lands and the rest of the balkans by apostle paul in the 1st century ad when the first organised christian communities were also formed by the beginning of the 4th century christianity had become the dominant religion in the region and towns like serdica sofia philipopolis plovdiv and adrianople edirne were significant centres of christianity in the roman empire the barbaric raids and incursions in the 4th and the 5th and the settlement of slavs and bulgars in the 6th and the 7th century wrought considerable damage to the ecclesiastical organisation of the christian church in the bulgarian lands yet they were far from destroying it christianity started to pave its way from the surviving christian communities to the surrounding slavic mass and by the middle of the 9th century the majority of the bulgarian slavs especially those living in thrace and macedonia were already christianised the process of conversion also enjoyed some success among the bulgar nobility however it was not until the official adoption of christianity by tsar boris i in 865 that conditions for the establishment of an independent bulgarian ecclesiastical entity were created establishment of the bulgarian orthodox church from the very start boris i was aware that the cultural advancement and the re affirmation of the sovereignty and prestige of a christian bulgaria could be achieved through an enlightened and zealous clergy governed by an autocephalous church to this end he manoeuvred between the patriarchate of constantinople and the roman pope for a period of five years until the fourth council of constantinople granted in 870 ad the bulgarians an autonomous bulgarian archbishopric the archbishopric had its seat in the bulgarian capital of pliska and its diocese covered the whole territory of the bulgarian state the pull of war between rome and constantinople was also resolved by putting the bulgarian archbishopric under the jurisdiction of the patriarch of constantinople from whom it obtained its first primate its clergy and theological books although the archbishopric enjoyed full internal autonomy the goals of boris i were scarcely fulfilled a greek liturgy offered by a byzantine clergy furthered neither the cultural development of the bulgarians nor the consolidation of the bulgarian state it would have eventually resulted in the loss of both the identity of the people and the statehood of bulgaria thus the arrival of the most distinguished disciples of saints cyril and methodius to bulgaria in 886 came as a highly beneficial opportunity boris i entrusted the disciples with the task to instruct the future bulgarian clergy in the glagolitic alphabet and the slavonic liturgy prepared by cyril and based on the vernacular of the bulgarian slavs from the region of thessaloniki in 893 the greek clergy was expelled from the country and the greek language was replaced with the slav bulgarian vernacular autocephaly of the bulgarian orthodox church patriarchate following two decisive victories over the byzantines at acheloy near the present day city of burgas and katassyrti near constantinople the autonomous bulgarian archbishopric was proclaimed autocephalous and elevated to the rank of patriarchate at an ecclesiastical and national council held in 919 after bulgaria and the byzantine empire signed in 927 a peace treaty concluding the incessant almost 20 year long war between them the patriarchate of constantinople recognised the autocephalous status of the bulgarian orthodox church and acknowledged its patriarchal dignity thus the bulgarian patriarchate became the first autocephalous slavic orthodox church its autocephalous status preceded the autocephaly of the serbian orthodox church 1219 by 300 years and of the russian orthodox church 1596 by some 600 years and the 6th patriarchate after rome constantinople jerusalem alexandria and antioch the seat of the patriarchate was the new bulgarian capital of preslav although the patriarch is likely to have resided in the town of drastar silistra an old christian centre famous for its martyrs and christian traditions the ohrid archbishopric on april 5 972 byzantine emperor john i tzimisces conquered and burned down preslav capturing bulgarian tsar boris ii patriarch damyan managed to escape initially to sredetz sofia in western bulgaria in the coming years the residence of the bulgarian patriarchs remained closely connected to the developments in the war between the next bulgarian monarchist dynasty the comitopuli and the byzantine empire thus patriarch german resided consecutively in moglen voden edessa and prespa both in present day north western greece around 990 the next patriarch philip moved to ohrid which also became the permanent seat of the patriarchate after the fall of bulgaria under byzantium domination in 1018 emperor basil ii bulgaroktonus the bulgar slayer acknowledged the autocephalous status of the bulgarian orthodox church and by virtue of special charters royal decrees set up its boundaries dioceses property and other privileges the church was however deprived of its patriarchal title and reduced to the rank of an archbishopric although the first appointed archbishop john of debar was a bulgarian his successors as well as the whole higher clergy were invariably greeks the monks and the ordinary priests remained however predominantly bulgarian thus allowing the archbishopric to preserve to a large extent its national character to uphold the slavonic liturgy and to continue its contribution to the development of the bulgarian literature the autocephaly of the ohrid archbishopric remained respected during the periods of byzantine bulgarian serbian and ottoman rule and the church continued to exist under the name archbishopric of the justiniana prima and all bulgaria until its unlawful abolition in 1767 the turnovo patriarchate as a results of the successful uprising of the brothers theodore i peter and ivan asen i in 1185 1186 the foundations of the second bulgarian state were laid with turnovo as its capital following boris i s principle that the sovereignty of the state is inextricably linked to the autocephaly of the church the two brothers immediately took steps for the restoration of the bulgarian patriarchate as a start an independent archbishopric was established in turnovo in 1186 the struggle for the recognition of the archbishopric according to the existing canonical order and its elevation to the rank of a patriarchate took however almost 50 years following the example of boris i bulgarian tsar kaloyan manoeuvered for years between the patriarch of constantinople and pope innocent iii until the latter finally proclaimed the turnovo archbishop vassily primate and archbishop of all bulgaria and walachia in 1203 the union with the roman catholic church continued for well over three decades under the reign of tsar ivan asen ii 1218 1241 conditions finally were created for the termination of the union with rome and for the recognition of the autocephalous status of the bulgarian orthodox church in 1235 a church council was convened in the town of lampsakos under the presidency of patriarch german ii of constantinople and with the consent of all eastern patriarchs the council confirmed the patriarchal dignity of the bulgarian orthodox church and consecrated the bulgarian archbishop german patriarch despite the shrinking of the diocese of the turnovo patriarchate at the end of the 13th century its authority in the eastern orthodox world remained high it was the patriarch of turnovo who confirmed the patriarchal dignity of the serbian orthodox church in 1346 despite protests by the constantinople it was also under the wing of the patriarchate that the turnovo literary school developed in the 14th century with scholars of the rank of patriarch evtimiy grigorii tsamblak konstantin of kostenets a considerable upsurge was noted in the field of literature architecture and painting the religious and theological literature flourished after the fall of turnovo under the ottomans in 1393 and the sending of patriarch evtimiy into exile the autocephalous church organization was destroyed once again the bulgarian diocese was subordinated to the patriarchate of constantinople the other bulgarian religious centre the ohrid archbishopric managed to survive a few centuries more until 1767 as a stronghold of faith and piety ottoman rule the period of the ottoman rule was the hardest in the history of the bulgarian orthodox church to the same extent to which it was also the hardest in the history of the bulgarian people during and immediately after the ottoman conquest the vast majority of the bulgarian churches and monasteries including the patriarchal cathedral church of the holy ascension in turnovo were razed to the ground with most of the surviving ones being turned into mosques most of the clergy perished while the intelligentsia around the turnovo literary school fled to neighbouring serbia wallachia moldova or to russia the church gave a number of martyrs as many districts and almost all larger towns in the bulgarian provinces of the ottoman empire were subjected to forceful conversion to islam as early as the first years after the conquest stunning were the feats of st george of kratovo 1515 st nicholas of sofia 1515 bishop vissarion of smolen 1670 damaskin of gabrovo 1771 st zlata of muglen 1795 st john the bulgarian 1814 st ignatius of stara zagora 1814 st onouphry of gabrovo 1818 and of many others who perished defending their faith the virtual decapitation of the bulgarian orthodox church was further emphasised by its full subordination to the patriarch of constantinople the millet system in the ottoman empire granted a number of important civil and judicial functions to the patriarch of constantinople and the diocesan metropolitans as the higher bulgarian church clerics were replaced by greek ones at the very beginning of the ottoman domination the bulgarian population was subjected before long to double oppression political by the ottomans and cultural by the greek clergy with the rise of greek nationalism in the second half of the 18th century the cultural oppression turned into an open assimilatory policy which was aimed at imposing the greek language and a greek consciousness on the emerging bulgarian bourgeoisie and which used as its basic tool the patriarchate of constantinople the opening of a number of schools with all round greek language curriculum and the virtual banning of the bulgarian liturgy at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century threatened the very survival of the bulgarians as a separate nation with its own distinct national culture if something was however instrumental in the preservation of the bulgarian language and the bulgarian national consciousness throughout the centuries of ottoman domination it was the monasteries especially the zograph and hilendar monasteries on mount athos as well as the rila troyan etropole dryanovo cherepish and dragalevtsi monasteries in bulgaria the monasteries managed to preserve their national character and continued the traditions of the slavonic liturgy and the bulgarian literature they also kept monastery schools and carried out other educational activities which if not more managed to keep the flame of the bulgarian culture burning until better times came the bulgarian exarchate in 1762 st paisius of hilendar 1722 1773 a monk from the south western bulgarian town of bansko wrote a short historical work which apart from being the first work written in the modern bulgarian vernacular was also the first ardent call for a national awakening in history of slav bulgarians paissiy urged his compatriots to throw off the subjugation to the greek language and culture the example of paissiy was followed by a number of other awakeners including st sophroniy of vratsa sofroni vrachanski 1739 1813 hieromonk spiridon of gabrovo hieromonk yoakim kurchovski d 1820 hieromonk kiril peichinovich d 1845 the result of the work of paissiy and his followers began before long to give fruit discontent with the supremacy of the greek clergy started to flare up in several bulgarian dioceses as early as the 1820s it was not however until the 1850 that the bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the greek clerics in a number of bishoprics demanding their replacement with bulgarian ones by that time most bulgarian religious leaders had realised that any further struggle for the rights of the bulgarians in the ottoman empire could not succeed unless they managed to obtain at least some degree of autonomy from the patriarchate of constantinople as the ottomans identified nationality with religion and the bulgarians were eastern orthodox they were automatically added to the roum milet i e the greeks thus if the bulgarians wanted to have bulgarian schools and liturgy in bulgarian they needed an independent ecclesiastical organisation the struggle between the bulgarians led by neofit bozveli and ilarion makariopolski and the greeks intensified throughout the 1860s as the greek clerics were ousted from most bulgarian bishoprics at the end of the decade the whole of northern bulgaria as well as the northern parts of thrace and macedonia had by all intents and purposes seceded from the patriarchate in recognition of that the ottoman government restored the once unlawfully destroyed bulgarian patriarchate under the name of bulgarian exarchate by a decree firman of the sultan promulgated on february 28 1870 the original exarchate extended over present day northern bulgaria moesia thrace without the vilayet of adrianople as well as over north eastern macedonia after the christian population of the bishoprics of skopje and ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the exarchate skopje by 91 ohrid by 97 the bulgarian exarchate became in control of the whole of vardar and pirin macedonia the exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern macedonia and the vilayet of adrianople by vicars thus the borders of the exarchate included all bulgarian districts in the ottoman empire the decision on the secession of the bulgarian orthodox church was far from well accepted by the patriarchate of constantinople which promptly declared the bulgarian exarchate schismatic and declared its adherents heretics although there was nothing non canonical about the status and the guiding principles of the exarchate the patriarchate argued that surrender of orthodoxy to ethnic nationalism was essentially a manifestation of heresy the first bulgarian exarch was antim i who was elected by the holy synod of the exarchate in february 1872 he was discharged by the ottoman government immediately after the outbreak of the russo turkish war 1877 78 on april 24 1877 and was sent into exile in ankara under the guidance of his successor joseph i the exarchate managed to develop and considerably extend its church and school network in the bulgarian principality eastern rumelia macedonia and the adrianople vilayet in 1895 the tarnovo constitution formally established the bulgarian orthodox church as the national religion of the nation on the eve of the balkan wars in macedonia and the adrianople vilayet alone the bulgarian exarchate disposed of seven dioceses with prelates and eight more with acting chairmen in charge and 38 vicariates 1 218 parishes and 1 212 parish priests 64 monasteries and 202 chapels as well as of 1 373 schools with 2 266 teachers and 78 854 pupils after world war i by virtue of the peace treaties the bulgarian exarchate was deprived of its dioceses in macedonia and aegean thrace exarch joseph i transferred his offices from istanbul to sofia as early as 1913 after the death of joseph i in 1915 the bulgarian orthodox church was not in a position to elect its regular head for a total of three decades second restoration of the bulgarian patriarchate conditions for the restoration of the bulgarian patriarchate and the election of head of the bulgarian church were created after world war ii in 1945 the schism was lifted and the patriarch of constantinople recognised the autocephaly of the bulgarian church in 1950 the holy synod adopted a new statute which paved the way for the restoration of the patriarchate and in 1953 it elected the metropolitan of plovdiv cyril bulgarian patriarch after the death of

 id=2569378 title hurricane katrina nonfiltered 1599 processed 1577 dbindex 1561620 hurricane katrina was the costliest and one of the deadliest hurricanes in the history of the united states it was the sixth strongest atlantic hurricane ever recorded and the third strongest hurricane on record that made landfall in the united states katrina formed on august 23rd during the 2005 atlantic hurricane season and caused devastation along much of the north central gulf coast of the united states most notable in media coverage were the catastrophic effects on the city of new orleans louisiana and in coastal mississippi due to its sheer size katrina devastated the gulf coast as far as 100 miles 160 km from the storm s center katrina was the eleventh tropical storm fifth hurricane third major hurricane and second category 5 hurricane of the 2005 atlantic season it formed over the bahamas on august 23 2005 and crossed southern florida as a moderate category 1 hurricane causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the gulf of mexico and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea the storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a category 3 storm on the morning of august 29 in southeast louisiana and at the louisiana mississippi state line respectively the storm surge caused severe and catastrophic damage along the gulf coast devastating the cities of mobile alabama bay st louis waveland and biloxi gulfport in mississippi and new orleans and other towns in louisiana levees separating lake pontchartrain and several canals from new orleans were breached by the surge subsequently flooding 80 of the city and many areas of neighboring parishes for weeks severe wind damage was reported well inland at least 1 836 people lost their lives in hurricane katrina and in the subsequent floods making it the deadliest u s hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane the storm is estimated to have been responsible for 81 2 billion 2005 u s dollars in damage making it the costliest natural disaster in u s history criticism of the federal state and local governments reaction to the storm was widespread and resulted in an investigation by the united states congress and the resignation of fema director michael brown storm history hurricane katrina formed as tropical depression twelve over the southeastern bahamas on august 23 2005 as the result of an interaction of a tropical wave and the remains of tropical depression ten the system was upgraded to tropical storm status on the morning of august 24 and at this point the storm was given the name katrina the tropical storm continued to move towards florida and became a hurricane only two hours before it made landfall between hallandale beach and aventura florida on the morning of august 25 the storm weakened over land but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the gulf of mexico the storm rapidly intensified after entering the gulf partly because of the storm s movement over the warm waters of the loop current on august 27 the storm reached category 3 intensity on the saffir simpson hurricane scale becoming the third major hurricane of the season an eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size katrina again rapidly intensified attaining category 5 status on the morning of august 28 and reaching its peak strength at 1 00 p m cdt that day with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 km h and a minimum central pressure of 902 mbar the pressure measurement made katrina the fourth most intense atlantic hurricane on record at the time only to be surpassed by hurricanes rita and wilma later in the season it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the gulf of mexico at the time a record also later broken by rita katrina made its second landfall at 6 10 a m cdt on august 29 as a category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h near buras triumph louisiana at landfall hurricane force winds extended outward 120 miles 190 km from the center and the storm s central pressure was 920 mbar after moving over southeastern louisiana and breton sound it made its third landfall near the louisiana mississippi border with 120 mph 195 km h sustained winds still at category 3 intensity katrina maintained hurricane strength well into mississippi but weakened thereafter finally losing hurricane strength more than 150 miles 240 km inland near meridian mississippi it was downgraded to a tropical depression near clarksville tennessee but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern great lakes region on august 31 when it was absorbed by a frontal boundary the resulting extratropical storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected ontario and quebec preparations florida many people living in the area were unaware when katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane in one day and struck southern florida near the miami dade broward county line the hurricane struck between the cities of aventura in miami dade county and hallandale in broward county on august 25 2005 however national hurricane center nhc forecasts had correctly predicted that katrina would intensify to hurricane strength before landfall and hurricane watches and warnings were issued 31 5 hours and 19 5 hours before landfall respectively only slightly less than the target thresholds of 36 and 24 hours florida governor jeb bush declared a state of emergency on august 24 in advance of katrina s landfall in florida shelters were opened and schools closed in several counties in the southern part of the state a number of evacuation orders were also issued mostly voluntary although a mandatory evacuation was ordered for at risk housing in martin county federal government on the morning of august 26 at 10 a m cdt 1500 utc katrina had strengthened to a category 3 storm in the gulf of mexico later that afternoon the nhc realized that katrina had yet to make the turn toward the florida panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the mississippi coast the nhc issued a hurricane watch for southeastern louisiana including the new orleans area at 10 a m cdt august 27 that afternoon the nhc extended the watch to cover the mississippi and alabama coastlines as well as the louisiana coast to intracoastal city the united states coast guard began pre positioning resources beyond the expected impact zone starting on august 26 and activated more than 400 reservists aircrews from the aviation training center in mobile staged rescue aircraft from texas to florida all aircraft were returning back towards the gulf of mexico by the afternoon of august 29 air crews many who lost their homes during the hurricane began a round the clock rescue effort in new orleans and along the mississippi and alabama coastlines president george w bush declared a state of emergency in louisiana alabama and mississippi two days before the hurricane made landfall that same evening the nhc upgraded the section of the hurricane watch from morgan city louisiana to the alabama florida border to a hurricane warning 12 hours after it was issued and also issued a tropical storm warning for the westernmost florida panhandle on august 28 as the sheer size of katrina became clear the nhc extended the tropical storm warning zone to cover most of the louisiana coastline and a larger proportion of the florida panhandle the national weather service s new orleans baton rouge office issued a vividly worded bulletin predicting that the area would be uninhabitable for weeks after devastating damage caused by katrina which at that time rivaled the intensity of hurricane camille voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast louisiana as well as coastal mississippi and alabama about 1 2 million residents of the gulf coast were covered under a voluntary or mandatory evacuation order gulf coast on august 26 the state of mississippi activated its national guard in preparation of the storm s landfall additionally the state government activated its emergency operations center the next day and local governments began issuing evacuation orders by 7 00 p m edt on august 28 11 counties and eleven cities issued evacuation orders a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities by the following morning moreover 57 emergency shelters were established on coastal communities with 31 additional shelters available to open if needed louisiana s hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to evacuate in three phases starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds persons in areas designated phase ii begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in phase iii areas including new orleans evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds many private care taking facilities that relied on bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges fuel and rental cars were in short supply and many forms of public transportation had been shut down well before the storm arrived some estimates claimed that 80 of the 1 3 million residents of the greater new orleans metropolitan area evacuated leaving behind substantially fewer people than remained in the city during the hurricane ivan evacuation by sunday august 28 most infrastructure along the gulf coast had been shut down including all canadian national railway and amtrak rail traffic into the evacuation areas as well as the waterford nuclear generating station the nhc maintained the coastal warnings until late on august 29 by which time hurricane katrina was over central mississippi greater new orleans area by august 26 the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered many of the computer models had shifted the potential path of katrina 150 miles westward from the florida panhandle putting the city of new orleans right in the center of their track probabilities the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17 with strike probability rising to 29 by august 28 this scenario was considered a potential catastrophe because 80 of the city of new orleans and the metro area on the southern shore is below sea level along lake pontchartrain since the storm surge produced by the hurricane s right front quadrant containing the strongest winds was forecast to be 28 feet 8 5 m emergency management officials in new orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city causing major flooding this risk of devastation was well known previous studies by fema and the army corps of engineers had warned that a direct hurricane strike on new orleans could lead to massive flooding which would lead to thousands of drowning deaths as well as many more suffering from disease and dehydration as the flood waters slowly receded from the city at a news conference at 10 00 a m on august 28 shortly after katrina was upgraded to a category 5 storm new orleans mayor ray nagin ordered the first ever mandatory evacuation of the city calling katrina a storm that most of us have long feared the city government also established several refuges of last resort for citizens who could not leave the city including the massive louisiana superdome which sheltered approximately 26 000 people and provided them with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore impact on august 29 katrina s storm surge caused several breaches in levees around new orleans most of the city was subsequently flooded as the breached drainage and navigation canals allowed water to flow from the lake into low areas of the city and saint bernard parish storm surge also devastated the coasts of mississippi and alabama making katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the united states and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane the total damage from katrina is estimated at 81 2 billion 2005 u s dollars nearly double the cost of the previously most expensive storm hurricane andrew when adjusted for inflation as of may 19 2006 the confirmed death toll total of direct and indirect deaths stood at 1 836 mainly from louisiana 1 577 and mississippi 238 however 705 people remain categorized as missing in louisiana so this number is not final even a year after the storm many of the deaths are indirect but it is almost impossible to determine the exact cause of some of the fatalities federal disaster declarations covered 90 000 square miles 233 000 km² of the united states an area almost as large as the united kingdom the hurricane left an estimated three million people without electricity on september 3 2005 homeland security secretary michael chertoff described the aftermath of hurricane katrina as probably the worst catastrophe or set of catastrophes in the country s history referring to the hurricane itself plus the flooding of new orleans south florida and cuba hurricane katrina first made landfall on august 25 2005 in south florida where it hit as a category 1 hurricane with 80 mph 130 km h winds rainfall was heavy in places and exceeded 14 inches 350 mm in homestead florida and a storm surge of 3 5 feet was measured in parts of monroe county more than 1 million customers were left without electricity and damage in florida was estimated at between 1 and 2 billion dollars with most of the damage coming from flooding and overturned trees there were 11 fatalities reported in florida as a result of hurricane katrina most of the florida keys experienced tropical storm force winds from katrina as the storm s center passed to the north with hurricane force winds reported in the dry tortugas rainfall was also high in the islands with 10 inches 250 mm falling on key west on august 26 a strong f1 tornado formed from an outer rain band of katrina and struck marathon the tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated 5 million dollars in damage although hurricane katrina stayed well to the north of cuba on august 29 it brought tropical storm force winds and rainfall of over 8 inches 200 mm to western regions of the island telephone and power lines were damaged and around 8 000 people were evacuated in the pinar del río province according to cuban television reports the coastal city of surgidero de batabano was 90 underwater louisiana on august 29 hurricane katrina made landfall near buras louisiana with 125 mph 205 km h winds as a strong category 3 storm however as it had only just weakened from category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large it is possible that sustained winds of category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern louisiana although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in mississippi was higher a very significant surge affected the louisiana coast the height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data although a tide gauge in plaquemines parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet 4 3 m and a 12 foot 3 m storm surge was recorded in grand isle hurricane katrina also brought heavy rain to louisiana with 8 10 inches 200 250 mm falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state in the area around slidell the rainfall was even higher and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15 inches 380 mm as a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of lake pontchartrain rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore affecting communities from slidell to mandeville several bridges were destroyed including the i 10 twin span bridge connecting slidell to new orleans almost 900 000 people in louisiana lost power as a result of hurricane katrina in hard hit st bernard parish which was entirely flooded by katrina the search for the missing was slow according to an interview in the new orleans times picayune the coroner was still trying to get a list of missing from the red cross in november 2005 while there were some victims on this list whose bodies were found in their homes the vast majority were tracked down through word of mouth and credit card records as of december 2005 the official missing list in the parish stood at 47 new orleans as the eye of hurricane katrina swept to the northeast it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in new orleans there were a few measurements of hurricane force winds from this the nhc concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of category 1 or category 2 strength however wind speeds increase with height and therefore the winds experienced on upper floors of high rise structures were likely to have been significantly higher the heavy winds and storm surges from katrina severely weakened the city s levee system and there were reports of extensive failures of the levees and flood walls protecting new orleans louisiana and surrounding communities the mississippi river gulf outlet mr go breached its levees in approximately 20 places flooding much of east new orleans east side most of saint bernard parish and the east bank of plaquemines parish the major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th street canal levee the london avenue canal and the wide navigable industrial canal which left approximately 80 of the city flooded most of the major roads traveling into and out of the city were damaged the only routes out of the city were the westbound crescent city connection and the huey p long bridge as large portions of the i 10 twin span bridge traveling eastbound towards slidell louisiana had collapsed the lake pontchartrain causeway only carried emergency traffic on august 29 at 7 40 a m cdt it was reported that most of the windows on the north side of the hyatt regency new orleans had been blown out and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage the hyatt was the most severely damaged hotel in the city with beds reported to be flying out of the windows insulation tubes were exposed as the hotel s glass exterior was completely sheared off the superdome which was sheltering a large number of people who had not evacuated sustained significant damage two sections of the superdome s roof were compromised and the dome s waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off louis armstrong new orleans international airport was closed before the storm but did not flood on august 30 it was reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations limited commercial passenger service resumed at the airport on september 13 and regular carrier operations resumed in early october katrina also caused widespread loss of life with over 700 bodies recovered in new orleans by october 23 some survivors and evacuees reported seeing dead bodies lying in city streets and floating in still flooded sections especially in the east of the city the advanced state of decomposition of many corpses some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead the first deaths reported from the city were reported shortly before midnight on august 28 as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to baton rouge most likely from dehydration while there were also early reports of fatalities amid mayhem at the superdome only six deaths were confirmed there with four of these originating from natural causes one from a drug overdose and one a suicide at the convention center four bodies were recovered one of the four is believed to be the result of a homicide mississippi the gulf coast of mississippi suffered massive damage from the impact of hurricane katrina on august 29 leaving 238 people dead 67 missing and billions of dollars in damages afterwards the lower 47 counties in mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance after making a brief initial landfall in louisiana katrina made its final landfall near the state line and the eyewall passed over the cities of bay st louis and waveland as a category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120 mph 195 km h katrina s powerful right front quadrant passed over the west and central mississippi coast causing a powerful 27 foot 8 2 m storm surge which penetrated 6 miles 10 km inland in many areas and up to 12 miles 20 km inland along bays and rivers in some areas the surge crossed interstate 10 for several miles hurricane katrina brought strong winds to mississippi which caused significant tree damage throughout the state the highest unofficial reported wind gust recorded from katrina was one of 135 mph 217 km h in poplarville in pearl river county the storm also brought heavy rains with 8 10 inches 200 250 mm falling in southwestern mississippi and rain in excess of 4 inches 100 mm falling throughout the majority of the state katrina caused eleven tornadoes in mississippi on august 29 some of which damaged trees and power lines battered by wind rain and storm surge some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled preliminary estimates by mississippi officials calculated that 90 of the structures within half a mile of the coastline were completely destroyed and that storm surges traveled as much as six miles inland in portions of the state s coast one apartment complex with approximately thirty residents seeking shelter inside collapsed more than half of the 13 casinos in the state which were floated on barges to comply with mississippi land based gambling laws were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves a number of streets and bridges were washed away on u s highway 90 along the mississippi gulf coast two major bridges were completely destroyed the bay st louis pass christian bridge and the biloxi ocean springs bridge in addition the eastbound span of the i 10 bridge over the pascagoula river estuary was damaged in the weeks after the storm with the connectivity of the coastal u s highway 90 shattered traffic traveling parallel to the coast was reduced to two lanes on the remaining i 10 span all three coastal counties of the state were severely affected by the storm katrina s surge was the most extensive as well as the highest in the documented history of the united states large portions of both hancock harrison and jackson counties were inundated by the storm surge in both cases affecting most of the populated areas surge covered almost the entire lower half of hancock county destroying the coastal communities of clermont harbor and waveland much of bay st louis and flowed up the jourdan river flooding kiln in harrison county pass christian was completely inundated along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast which includes the cities of long beach and gulfport the flooding was more extensive in communities such as d iberville which borders back bay biloxi on a peninsula between the back bay and the coast was particularly hard hit especially the low lying point cadet area in jackson county storm surge flowed up the wide river estuary with the combined surge and freshwater flooding cutting the county in half remarkably over 90 of pascagoula the easternmost coastal city in mississippi and about 75 miles east of katrina s landfall near the louisiana mississippi border was flooded from surge at the height of the storm other large jackson county neighborhoods such as porteaux bay and gulf hills were severely damaged with large portions being completely destroyed and st martin was hard hit ocean springs moss point gautier and escatawpa also suffered major surge damage mississippi emergency management agency officials also recorded deaths in hinds warren and leake counties over 900 000 people throughout the state experienced power outages southeast united states although hurricane katrina made landfall well to the west alabama and the florida panhandle were both affected by a significant storm surge and tropical storm force winds sustained winds of 67 mph 107 km h were recorded in mobile alabama and the storm surge there was approximately 10 feet 3 meters the surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along mobile bay four tornadoes were also reported in alabama an oil rig under construction along the mobile river broke its moorings and floated 1 5 miles 2 km northwards before striking the cochrane bridge just outside mobile no significant damage resulted to the bridge and it was soon reopened the damage on dauphin island was severe with the surge destroying many houses and cutting a new canal through the western portion of the island an offshore oil rig also became grounded on the island as in mississippi the storm surge caused significant beach erosion along the alabama coastline more than 600 000 people lost power in alabama as a result of hurricane katrina and two people died in a traffic accident in the state along the florida panhandle the storm surge was typically about five feet 1 5 m and along the west central florida coast there was a minor surge of 1 2 feet 0 3 0 6 m in pensacola florida 56 mph 90 km h winds were recorded on august 29 the winds caused damage to some trees and structures and there was some minor flooding in the panhandle there were two indirect fatalities from katrina in walton county as a result of a traffic accident in the florida panhandle 77 000 customers lost power northern and central georgia were affected by heavy rains and strong winds from hurricane katrina as the storm moved inland with more than 3 inches 75 mm of rain falling in several areas at least 18 tornadoes formed in georgia on august 29 the most on record in that state for one day in august the most serious of these tornadoes was a f2 tornado which affected heard county and carroll county this tornado caused 3 injuries and one fatality and damaged several houses in addition this tornado destroyed several poultry barns killing over 140 000 chicks the other tornadoes caused significant damages to buildings and agricultural facilities in addition to the fatality caused by the f2 tornado there was another fatality in a traffic accident other u s states and canada hurricane katrina weakened as it moved inland but tropical storm force gusts were recorded as far north as fort campbell kentucky on august 30 and the winds damaged trees in new york the remnants of the storm brought high levels of rainfall to a wide swath of the eastern united states and rain in excess of 2 inches 50 mm fell in parts of 20 states a number of tornadoes associated with katrina formed on august 30 and august 31 which caused minor damages in several regions in total 62 tornadoes formed in eight states as a result of katrina eastern arkansas received light rain from the passage of katrina gusty winds downed some trees and power lines though damage was minimal in kentucky a storm that had moved through the weekend before had already produced flooding and the rainfall from katrina added to this as a result of the flooding kentucky s governor ernie fletcher declared 3 counties disaster areas and a statewide state of emergency one person was killed in hopkinsville kentucky and part of a high school collapsed flooding also prompted a number of evacuations in west virginia and ohio the rainfall in ohio leading to two indirect deaths katrina also caused a number of power outages in many areas with over 100 000 customers affected in tennessee primarily in the memphis and nashville areas the remnants of katrina merged with a frontal system over ohio but the moisture continued north and affected canada on august 31 in ontario there were a few isolated reports of rain in excess of 100 mm 4 inches and there were a few reports of damage from fallen trees flooding also occurred both in ontario and quebec cutting off a number of isolated villages in quebec aftermath economic effects the economic effects of the storm were far reaching as of april 2006 the bush administration has sought 105 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region and this does not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply destruction of the gulf coast s highway infrastructure and exports of commodities such as grain katrina damaged or destroyed 30 oil platforms and caused the closure of nine refineries the total shut in oil production from the gulf of mexico in the six month period following katrina was approximately 24 of the annual production and the shut in gas production for the same period was about 18 the forestry industry in mississippi was also affected as 1 3 million acres of forest lands were destroyed the total loss to the forestry industry from katrina is calculated to rise to about 5 billion furthermore hundreds of thousands of local residents were left unemployed which will have a trickle down effect as fewer taxes are paid to local governments before the hurricane the region supported approximately one million non farm jobs with 600 000 of them in new orleans it is estimated that the total economic impact in louisiana and mississippi may exceed 150 billion katrina redistributed new orleans population across the southern united states houston texas had an increase of 35 000 people mobile alabama gained over 24 000 baton rouge louisiana over 15 000 and hammond louisiana received over 10 000 nearly doubling its size chicago received over 6 000 people the most of any non southern city by late january 2006 about 200 000 people were once again living in new orleans less than half of the pre storm population by july 1 2006 when new population estimates were calculated by the u s census bureau the state of louisiana showed a population decline of 219 563 or 4 87 additionally insurance companies have stopped insuring the area because of the high costs from hurricanes katrina and rita or have raised insurance premiums to cover their risk environmental effects katrina also had a profound impact on the environment the storm surge caused substantial beach erosion in some cases completely devastating coastal areas in dauphin island approximately 90 miles 150 km to the east of the point where the hurricane made landfall the sand that comprised the barrier island was transported across the island into the mississippi sound pushing the island towards land the storm surge and waves from katrina also obliterated the chandeleur islands which had been affected by hurricane ivan the previous year the lands that were lost were also breeding grounds for marine mammals brown pelicans turtles and fish as well as migratory species such as redhead ducks overall about 20 of the local marshes were permanently overrun by water as a result of the storm katrina also forced the closure of 16 national wildlife refuges of which breton national wildlife refuge received the worst damage as half of its area was swept off as a result the hurricane affected the habitats of sea turtles mississippi sandhill cranes red cockaded woodpeckers and alabama beach mice finally as part of the cleanup effort the flood waters that covered new orleans were pumped into lake pontchartrain a process that took 43 days to complete these residual waters contained a mix of raw sewage bacteria heavy metals pesticides toxic chemicals and about 6 5 million u s gallons 24 6 million l of oil which has sparked fears in the scientific community of massive numbers of fish dying looting and violence shortly after the hurricane moved away on august 30 2005 some residents of new orleans who remained in the city began looting stores as did some mississippi residents in their local stores and casinos many looters were in search of food and water that were not available to them through any other means reports of carjacking murders thefts and rapes in new orleans flooded the news several news media later determined that most reports were based on rumors thousands of national guard and federal troops were mobilized and sent to louisiana along with numbers of local law enforcement agents from across the country who were temporarily deputized by the state they have m16s and are locked and loaded these troops know how to shoot and kill and i expect they will louisiana governor kathleen blanco said congressman bill jefferson d la told abc news there was shooting going on there was sniping going on over the first week of september law and order was gradually restored to the city several shootings were between police and new orleans residents including the fatal incident at danziger bridge a number of arrests were made throughout the affected area including near the new orleans convention center a temporary jail was constructed of chain link cages in the city train station in texas where more than 300 000 evacuees are located local officials have run 20 000 criminal background checks on the evacuees as well as on the relief workers helping them and people who have opened up their homes most of the checks have found little for police to be concerned about the number of homicides in houston from september 2005 through february 22 2006 went up by 23 relative to the same period a year before 29 of the 170 murders involved displaced louisianans as a victim a suspect or both government response within the united states and as delineated in the national response plan disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility when local government exhausts its resources it then requests specific additional resources from the county level the request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back up communications systems at various levels some disaster recovery response to katrina began before the storm with federal emergency management agency fema preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a mortuary team with refrigerated trucks a network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from new orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall and has continued for more than six months after the storm of the 60 000 people stranded in new orleans the coast guard rescued more than 33 500 congress recognized the coast guard s response with an official entry in the congressional record and the armed service was awarded the presidential unit citation the united states northern command established joint task force jtf katrina based out of camp shelby mississippi to act as the military s on scene command on sunday august 28 approximately 58 000 national guard personnel were activated to deal with the storm s aftermath with troops coming from all 50 states the department of defense also activated volunteer members of the civil air patrol michael chertoff secretary of the department of homeland security decided to take over the federal state and local operations officially on august 30 2005 citing the national response plan early in september congress authorized a total of 62 3 billion in aid for victims additionally president bush enlisted the help of former presidents bill clinton and george h w bush to raise additional voluntary contributions much as they did after the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami american flags were also ordered to be half staff from september 2 2005 to september 20 2005 in honor of the victims fema provided housing assistance rental assistance trailers etc to more than 700 000 applicants families and individuals however only one fifth of the trailers requested in orleans parish have been supplied resulting in an enormous housing shortage in the city of new orleans to provide for additional housing fema has also paid for the hotel costs of 12 000 individuals and families displaced by katrina through february 7 2006 when a final deadline was set for the end of hotel cost coverage after this deadline evacuees were still eligible to receive federal assistance which could be used towards either apartment rent additional hotel stays or fixing their ruined homes although fema no longer paid for hotels directly as of early july 2006 there are still about 100 000 people living in 37 745 fema provided trailers law enforcement and public safety agencies from across the united states provided a mutual aid response to louisiana and new orleans in the weeks following the disaster many agencies responded with manpower and equipment from as far away as california michigan nevada new york and texas this response was welcomed by local louisiana authorities as their staff were either becoming fatigued stretched too thin or even quitting from the job two weeks after the storm more than half of the states were involved in providing shelter for evacuees by four weeks after the storm evacuees had been registered in all 50 states and in 18 700 zip codes half of the nation s residential postal zones most evacuees had stayed within 250 miles 400 km but 240 000 households went to houston and other cities over 250 miles away and another 60 000 households went over 750 miles 1 200 km away criticism of government response the criticisms of the government s response to hurricane katrina primarily consisted of condemnations of mismanagement and lack of leadership in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath more specifically the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of new orleans and the subsequent state of chaos in the crescent city the neologism katrinagate was coined to refer to this controversy and was even a runner up for 2005 word of the year within days of katrina s august 29 2005 landfall public debate arose about the local state and federal governments role in the preparations for and response to the hurricane criticism was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained in new orleans without water food or shelter the deaths of citizens by thirst exhaustion and violence days after the storm itself had passed also fueled the criticism as did the treatment of people who had been evacuated to facilities such as the superdome others alleged that race class and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response the percentage of black victims among storm related deaths 49 was below their proportion in the area s population approx 60 nonetheless criticisms focused mostly on the response after the initial flooding i e after most of the deaths had already occurred one notable event occurred when jack strain sheriff of nearby st tammany parish told reporters i don t get into calling people names and all that fact but if you re gonna walk the streets of st tammany parish with dreadlocks and chee wee hairstyles then you can expect to be getting a visit from a sheriff s deputy the comments were widely criticized as racist by the southern poverty law center and other groups and individuals the government was accused of making things worse instead of making things better perhaps even deliberately by preventing help by others while delaying its own response in accordance with federal law president george w bush directed the secretary of the department of homeland security michael chertoff to coordinate the federal response chertoff designated michael d brown head of the federal emergency management agency as the principal federal official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the gulf coast region however the president and secretary chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination eight days later brown was recalled to washington and coast guard vice admiral thad w allen replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations three days after the recall michael d brown resigned as director of fema in spite of having received praise from bush with the now well known phrase you re doing a heck of a job on september 2 2005 during a benefit concert for hurricane katrina relief on nbc a concert for hurricane relief west was a featured speaker controversy arose when west was presenting as he deviated from the prepared script i hate the way they portray us in the media you see a white family it says they re looking for food you see a black family it says they re looting and you know it s been five days for federal help because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about it i would be a hypocrite because i ve tried to turn away from the teacher the tv because it s too hard to watch i ve even been shopping before even giving a donation so now i m calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount i can give and just to imagine if i was down there and those are my people down there so anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with the way america is set up to help the poor the black people the less well off as slow as possible i mean the red cross is doing everything they can we already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now fighting another way and they ve given them permission to go down and shoot us mike myers whom west was paired with to present spoke next and continued as normal by reading the script once it was west s turn to speak again he delivered the controversial phrase george bush doesn t care about black people although the camera quickly cut away to chris tucker west s comments still reached all of the u s kanye west and mike myers met again on a brief sketch on saturday night live in which myers joked that since the telethon the government has stripped him of his american citizenship still got my canadian citizenship to fall back on myers joked and placed him under heavy government surveillance criticism from politicians activists pundits and journalists of all stripes has been directed at the local and state and governments headed by mayor ray nagin of new orleans and louisiana governor kathleen blanco nagin and blanco were criticized for failing to implement new orleans evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food water security or sanitary conditions perhaps the most important criticism of nagin is that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall which led to hundreds of deaths of people who by that time could not find any way out of the city the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina has raised other more general public policy issues about emergency management environmental policy poverty and unemployment the discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may affect elections and legislation enacted at various levels of government the storm s devastation also caused a congressional investigation which found that fema and the red cross did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of gulf coast victims additionally it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government an abc news poll conducted on september 2 2005 showed slightly more blame is being directed at state and local governments 75 percent than at the federal government 67 percent with 44 percent blaming president bush s leadership directly a later cnn usatoday gallup poll showed that respondents disagreed widely on who is to blame for the problems in the city following the hurricane 13 percent said bush 18 said federal agencies 25 blamed state or local officials and 38 said no one was to blame international response over seventy countries pledged monetary donations or other assistance kuwait made the largest single pledge 500 million other large donations were made by qatar 100 million south korea 30 million india china both 5 million pakistan 1 5 million and bangladesh 1 million israel sent an idf delegation to new orleans to transport aid equipment including 80 tons of food disposable diapers beds blankets generators and additional equipment which were donated from different governmental institutions civilian institutions and the idf the bush administration announced in mid september that it did not need israeli divers and physicians to come to the united states for search and rescue missions but a small team landed in new orleans on september 10 to give assistance to operations already under way the team administered first aid to survivors rescued abandoned pets and discovered hurricane victims cuba and venezuela were the first countries to offer aid in the form of 1 million 1 100 doctors 26 4 metric tons of medicine two mobile hospitals 10 water purifying plants 18 generators 20 tons of bottled water 50 tons of canned food and 66 000 barrels of heating oil their offers were refused by the u s government countries like sri lanka which was still recovering from the indian ocean tsunami also offered to help countries including canada mexico singapore and germany sent supplies relief personnel troops ships and water pumps to aid in the disaster recovery britain s donation of 350 000 emergency meals did not reach victims because of laws regarding mad cow disease russia s initial offer of two jets was declined by the u s state department but accepted later the french offer was also declined and requested later despite receiving aid from around the world there was also a heavy dose of criticism from around the world including accusations of racism that were revealed at the international level across global press quotations from the uk mirror such as many things about the united states are wonderful but it has a vile underbelly which is usually kept well out of sight now in new orleans it has been exposed to the world were common non governmental organization response the american red cross southern baptist association salvation army oxfam common ground collective emergency communities and many other charitable organizations provided housing food and water to the victims of the storm these organizations also provided an infrastructure for shelters throughout louisiana and other states that held thousands of evacuees they were not however allowed into new orleans proper by the national guard for several days after the storm because of safety concerns these organizations raised 4 25 billion usd in donations by the public with the red cross receiving over half of the donations volunteers from amateur radio s emergency service wing the amateur radio emergency service provided emergency communications for federal state and local officials over 1 000 volunteer operators traveled to affected areas to provide communications in areas where the communications infrastructure had been damaged or totally destroyed relaying everything from 911 traffic to messages home in hancock county mississippi ham radio operators provided the only communications into or out of the area and even served as 911 dispatchers many corporations also contributed to relief efforts on september 13 2005 it was reported that corporate donations to the relief effort were 409 million and were expected to exceed 1 billion during and after the hurricanes katrina wilma and rita the american red cross had opened 1 470 different shelters across and registered 3 8 million overnight stays a total of 244 000 red cross workers 95 of which were non paid volunteers were utilized to provide sheltering casework communication and assessment services throughout these three hurricanes in addition 346 980 comfort kits which contain hygiene essentials such as toothpaste soap washcloths and toys for children and 205 360 clean up kits containing brooms mops and bleach were distributed for mass care the organization served 68 million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers the red cross also had their disaster health services meet 596 810 contacts and disaster mental health services met 826 590 contacts red cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1 4 million families which encompassed a total of 4 million people hurricane katrina was the first natural disaster in the united states that the american red cross utilized their safe and well family location website in the year following katrina s strike on the gulf coast the salvation army allocated donations of more than 365 million to serve more than 1 7 million people in nearly every state the organization s immediate response to hurricane katrina included the mobilization of more than 178 canteen feeding units and 11 field kitchens which together have served more than 5 7 million hot meals 8 3 million sandwiches snacks drinks its satern network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25 000 survivors salvation army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277 000 individuals as part of the overall effort salvation army officers employees and volunteers contributed more than 900 000 hours of service analysis of new orleans levee failures new orleans levee failures were found to be primarily the result of system design flaws combined with the lack of adequate maintenance those responsible for the conception design construction and maintenance of the region s flood control system apparently failed to pay sufficient attention to public safety according to an investigation by the national science foundation according to new modeling and field observations by a team from louisiana state university the mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo a 200 meter 660 ft wide canal designed to provide a shortcut from new orleans to the gulf of mexico helped provide a funnel for the storm surge making it 20 higher and 100 200 faster as it crashed into the city st bernard parish one of the more devastated areas lies just south of the mrgo the army corps of engineers disputes this causality and maintains katrina would have overwhelmed the levees with or without the contributing effect of the mrgo on april 5 2006 months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength lieutenant general carl strock testified before the united states senate subcommittee on energy and water that we have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure he also testified that the u s army corps of engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to august 29 2005 the claim of ignorance is refuted however by the national science foundation investigators hired by the army corps of engineers who point to a 1986 study by the corps itself that such separations were possible in the i wall design additionally various conspiracy theories began floating around that the levees were in fact deliberately demolished the most commonly cited culprit in these conspiracy theories is the unesco biosphere program in an attempt to re wild the region these theories arose when several new orleans residents described hearing explosions coming from the levees before the floodwaters rushed in and by a national guard worker who claims he was sworn to secrecy upon finding explosives residue at the site of the break media involvement many representatives of the news media reporting on the aftermath of hurricane katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events instead of simply reporting because of the loss of most means of communication such as land based and cellular telephone systems field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities the authorities who monitored local and network news broadcasts as well as internet sites would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports one illustration was when geraldo rivera of fox news tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the ernest n morial convention center the storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of internet sites especially blogging and community journalism one example was the effort of nola com the web affiliate of new orleans times picayune which was awarded the breaking news pulitzer prize and shared the public service pulitzer with the biloxi based sun herald the newspaper s coverage was carried for days only on nola s blogs as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on august 30 the site became an international focal point for news by local media and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums nola was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams from individuals to the coast guard which used information in rescue efforts much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the sms functions of their cell phones to friends and relatives outside the area who then relayed the information back to nola com the aggregation of community journalism user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention and was called a watershed moment in journalism in the wake of these online only efforts the pulitzer committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries as the u s military and rescue services regained control over the city there were restrictions on the activity of the media on september 9 the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have zero access to efforts to recover bodies in new orleans immediately following this announcement cnn filed a lawsuit and obtained a temporary restraining order against the ban the next day the government backed down and reversed the ban hurricane katrina has also been the centerpiece of several documentary films including spike lee s film when the levees broke and darren martinez s film hellp retirement because of the large loss of life and property along the gulf coast the name katrina was officially retired on april 6 2006 by the world meteorological organization at the request of the u s government it was replaced by katia on list iii of the

 id=6479206 title lateral communication nonfiltered 1633 processed 1611 dbindex 1561656 lateral communication means communication between and amongst all given entities at a particular level of an organization for example a coordinated flock of birds or a shoal of fish all maintain their relative positions or alter direction simultaneously due to lateral communication amongst members this is achieved due to tiny pressure variations an ants termites bees nest is not coordinated by messages sent by the queen ant bee termite but by the lateral communication mediated by scent trails of the ants its physical structure is an emergent property of the individual entities bactieral colonies communicate with each other coordinating for exmple an attack or the productin of slime using lateral communication based on chemical messengers so that as a group they can detect how many collegues there are and if they are likely to overwhelm a target a group of individuals can often achieve a task without a specific leader but through numerous dialogues or lateral communication the pacemaker cells in the heart cardiac pacemaker is a very small group of cells where lateral communications sweeps through the cells much like a mexican wave as a three dimensional circulating wave which relays contraction signals to the whole heart the slime mould slime mould is an extraordinary organism millions of individual amoeba like creatures can spread out and graze the surface of a leaf when conditions change the amoeba all concentrate and form a slug like creature which can actually move off somewhere else before forming a spore body and releasing millions of individual spores again lateral communication between the individuals controls this process there is no slime mould uber mind it has been observed that they can find their way through mazes by spreading out and choosing the shortest path an interesting example of information processing without a nervous system in 2006 researchers at the university of southampton and the university of kobe reported that they had built a six legged robot whose movement was remotely controlled by a physarum slime mould the mould directed the robot into a dark corner most similar to its natural habitat children are adept at lateral communication but in school this is frowned upon particularly in lessons and central communication is enforced unfortunately this habit of mind tends to persist in adults and lack of lateral communication often leads to sub optimal results in excessively hierarchic organization where lateral communication is frowned upon or actively discouraged whilst an army is often considered as highly centrally controlled in fact once in action forces are largely disposed by each unit noting the position of other units and mutually disposing themselves accordingly and soldiers in each unit doing the same they don t all blunder in like automatons the positions of human cells and which type of cell is mediated by lateral communication when this breaks down ie the cell becomes deaf to communications from its neeghbours cancer is one result likewise on the parade ground whilst the sergeant major is drilling them they all keep coordinated with each other by laterally communication by noting where the mass is and fixing there position relative to that thus lateral communication is an essential feature of organizing natural systems and human organizations lateral communication can be encouraged by lateral media and replaced by central media by both replacing lms role and making it redundant central

gustavus adolphus of sweden the protestant forces achieved their first major victory during the thirty years wars the victory confirmed the swedish king as a great tactical leader and induced many protestant german states to ally with sweden against catholic austria prelude in late august 1631 the imperial commander and champion of the german catholic league tilly invaded electoral saxony in hopes of forcing its ruler john george i to abandon an alliance he planned to conclude with gustavus adolphus the swedish king responded by uniting his army with the elector s forces hoping to fight tilly and force him to leave saxony tilly arrayed his forces north of leipzig at breitenfeld and prepared to meet gustavus adolphus tactics the most important difference between the two armies was tactics the imperial catholic league forces arranged their army in regiments of infantry and cavalry the infantry formed up in large blocks of about 1500 men each with a front of 150 men and a depth of 10 men the centre comprised pikemen with supporting units of musketeers on each flank the imperial army was comprised of fourteen such formations twelve arranged in groups of three blocks with the center block placed slightly ahead of the other two the final two regiments were attached one each to the right and left wings the cavalry was drawn up on each flank pappenheim commanding the left and fürstenburg the right the left flank was close by breitenfeld the right by seehausen tilly had no reserves except for some cavalry placed behind his infantry gustavus adolphus however arranged his forces in two long lines each line was five men deep for pikemen and six men deep for musketeers the use of linear tactics enabled gustavus to create a front that matched tilly s while still giving him troops to keep in reserve gustavus mixed his artillery and some cavalry into the main formation the elector of saxony arranged his forces in the traditional formation on the swedish left and all commanders placed most of their cavalry on their flanks since the swedish and saxon forces deployed separately this placed cavalry in their center as well as on their flanks battle the battle began around noon with a two hour exchange of artillery fire during which the swedish fire power was demonstrated in a rate of fire of three to five volleys to one this uneven exchange ended when count pappenheim led a charge of the heavy cavalry on tilly s left these cuirassiers advanced seven times but each time was turned back by the swedes the swedes used the tactic of mixing men armed with muskets with their cavalry who were able to defeat the light cavalry pistol tactics used by the imperial forces swedish reserve cavalry were also able to extend the swedish line and countercharge with sabers against the imperial cavalry following the defeat of his seventh assault pappenheim and his cavalry quit the field in disarray pappenheim s heavy cavalry called the black cuirassiers then retreated to halle pursued initially by some swedish cavalry but these were called back by gustavus while the swedish guns continued to pound the troops of the catholic league during this time tilly s infantry remained stationary but then the cavalry on his right charged the saxon cavalry and routed it towards eilenburg seeing an opportunity tilly sent the majority of his infantry against the remaining saxon forces in an oblique march diagonally across his front and the whole saxon body fled the field and stopped only briefly to loot the swedish camp tilly thus defeated forty percent of his enemy and was poised to deliver a devastating flank attack on the remaining protestants as tilly was ordering his infantry to roll up the swedish line however gustavus adolphus was able to reorder his second line into an array at a right angle to the front in a maneuver known as refusing the flank a similar tactic was used at gettysburg at little round top this deprived tilly of the opportunity for an attack on the protestant flank following this a charge by the swedish cavalry the finnish hakkapeliittas was able to drive off the rest of the imperial cavalry with this help the protestant infantry was able to gain the upper hand soon under fire from both the excellent swedish guns and captured imperial guns the imperial infantry was forced to retire from the field aftermath the battle of breitenfeld served as major endorsement of the linear tactics of gustavus adolphus he was able to inflict more than sixty percent casualties on his opponent and made up his own losses in recruited prisoners after the battle the catholic league or imperial army under tilly only had 6 000 left gustavus adolphus on the other hand had a greater army after the battle than before the battle s outcome also had the political effect of convincing protestant states to join his cause france later supported the militarily strong but economically weak sweden from 1630 to 1632 the cost of gustavus army was shorted by 80 but the strength was increased to over 350 references c v wedgwood the thirty years war new york book of the month club 1995 richard a preston et al men in arms 5th ed fort worth

 id=5967429 title amato nonfiltered 1648 processed 1626 dbindex 1561671 amato is a comune and town in the province of catanzaro in the calabria region of italy history amato is one of the oldest towns in calabria it is mentioned by the greek philosopher aristotle who calls it portus amati fluminis harbour of the amato river it is also mentioned by the roman plinio il vecchio in one of his books he calls it sinus lametinus lametino harbour it appears that the people of amato originated from the ancient city of lametia on the promontory of the gulf of sant eufemia near the mouth of the amato river it was one of the most thriving cities of old calabria which at that time was called bruttium from an english publication entitled brief history of amato we learn that amato existed many years before the foundation of rome from this book we also learn that at that time amato was very industrious and had a population of about 20 000 people its economy was centred around the very important textile industry with about 1300 looms at work in fact even up to a few years ago many amatese women had a loom and many of them were very capable weavers production of the silkworm was also a very popular activity that primeval but progressive town was destroyed by floods and everything was buried underneath a swampy cover many of its inhabitants perished others relocated to other cities like sant eufemia nicastro sambiase bella etc few families relocated to the hills of the plateau of the amato river where they built a new town but kept the same name these people settled on the hills of piano di amato lachi cutro amendola and andressi this entire area was later called umbri and even today it is known by the same name umbri in latin means saved from the floods and it was here that these people built the new amato remains of two old churches san nicola and sant andrea and of a castle nearby are proof of the existence of amato at this location also during some excavation work a golden cross and golden chalice were found later on two workers pietro pingitore and francesco romeo both presently residing in winnipeg manitoba canada found in this same area some very old coins unfortunately all these were misplaced by the public authority before experts had an opportunity to study them the inhabitants of this new town alas did not have an easy time at this new location in fact they were afflicted with malaria they were constantly attacked by pirates and bandits and inundated by floods they did not give up they just moved to higher grounds at the present location of amato amato is located to the north of the cantanzaro isthmus at an altitude of 480 metres above sea level between the gulfs of sant eufemia and squillace this new town appears to have been built during the middle ages when the normans came to the amato plains in fact thanks to the normans the amato plains were fortified against pirate attacks they built castles at nicastro maida feroleto and one also at amato still in existence today the first inhabitants 1000 800 b c the italias were the first established people of calabria later came the bretti from lucania these occupied calabria and called it bruzio the bruzi were very advanced culturally they dedicated themselves to agriculture and to the raising of domestic animals later they started handicrafts and industries promoted commerce and developed the exchange of their products with near by people the greeks 800 300 b c between the viii and vii century b c the greeks occupied the shores of calabria their first colonies soon became very wealthy and thriving by limiting their activities to the exchange of manufactured goods for agricultural products later they occupied all of southern italy and monopolized the entire commerce of the region thanks to the greeks calabria became a very industrious and productive region it was part of magna crecia the romans during the war between the romans and pyrrhus the bruzi fought beside the army of taranto against the romans the romans defeated pyrrhus occupied taranto and all other cities of calabria including amato during the second punic war calabria was occupied by hannibal and the bruzi once again fought against the romans hannibal was defeated and calabria was roman again rome imposed some very harsh penalties to the inhabitants of calabria and many cities were burned down and destroyed was it then that amato was destroyed no one knows the contributions of amato during the punic wars are not known we do however know that amato at that time was located at a very strategic location in the gulf of sant eufemia and therefore could have played a very important role barbarians bizantini saraceni and normans after the fall of the roman empire italy no longer guarded by the roman legions was invaded by the barbarians the visigoths attacked and occupied rome and later moved towards sicily after the visigoths we have the heruli the ostrogoths and the bizantini in 827 southern italy was invaded by the terrible saracens who burned down and destroyed everything that opposed them they used to attack the coast of calabria steal childlren and sell them as slaves the normans after the accord of melfi pope niccolo ii gave to the normans the government of calabria and puglia the normans were very democratic and enterprising we owe to them the creation of the abbey of sant eufemia lamezia the construction of the sanctuary of the madonna of dipodi the fortification of the amato plains and the introduction of the sugar cane under norman rule the amato plains enjoyed peace and prosperity under their rule pope callistro ii personally visited all the towns of the amato plains during this visit he inaugurated the sanctuary of dipodi consecrated the cathedral of nicastro the church of mileto and then he went to catanzaro to consecrate the church maggiore after the normans feudalism from the 1st half of the 1400 the history of amato begins to be better documented at that time the territory of amato was given to the feudatory francesco rodio of catanzaro by alfonso i king of naples then it was transferred to prince marcantonio of loffredo in 1635 it was given to donato a mottola by the king of spain donato a mottola was given the title of marquis of amato after his death the territory amatese was inherited by his son orazio mottola who was also baron of joppolo coccorino and monterosso in 1675 the territory of amato ceased to belong to the mottola family and was subdivided into small holdings the entire area was first called the university of amato and later commune of amato with the subdivision of the territory every resident of amato became a private landowner vast territories were granted to the wealthiest families anania caligiuri can tafio cianflone cosentino d amico falvo fiorentino grande graziano jenzi lo scerbo lo schiavo mauro mazza mottola pallone papucci rossi todaro torchia the commune of amato kept for itself the forestlands this was however contested by the mottola family this dispute was later resolved by the king commissioner angelo masci under his ordinance the commune of amato was granted two thirds of its claim morespecifically montagna soprana and montagna sottana the other one third was given to the mottola family the commune also received one half of the territory known as mugamero with the other half remaining to the mottolas with the subdivision of the amato territory many residents became small landowners however many were unable to survive from these little farms and soon they sold their possessions to other landowners thus contributing to the consolidation of large territories under the ownership of few families but by the xix century the cycle reversed again the family units began to disintegrate and larger farms became smaller units once again because of subdivisions amongst heirs the lands that the richer landowners did not cultivate themselves when not neede d for pasture were given to share croppers these were responsible for the farming of the land and in return would keep 3 4 or 2 3 of the net production depending on the crop they were allowed to keep a pig a goat some sheep and chickens on the land to help them provide for their families this procedure good up to 1900 was improved by dr giuseppe caligiuri who in order to induce his share croppers to cultivate more land put at their disposal a plough pulled by two oxen dr caligiuri s initiative was not well received by the other padroni they believed that this new approach to farming would benefit more the share cropper than it would benefit them instead of supporting this brilliant initiative the other landowners closed themselves into a mean conservatism not well received by the sharecroppers share croppers were soon prohibited to raise their own animals even though located far away from the land of the padrone people had not been subject to these measures and such working conditions not even during feudalism and to make things worse this happened at a time when farmers were anticipating greater assistance to increase productivity through modern farming machinery selected seeds and fertilizers loss of freedom and the inability of the share croppers to provide for their families induced them to one by one abandon the lands that they and their fathers before them had farmed for years and were deeply attached to they left their lands they left amato and immigrated into more industrialized nations in search of a future for their children san francesco di paola saint francesco of paola is the patron saint of amato in the central square of amato stands a statue of the patron saint that protects the commune it was erected thanks to father serafino falvo

continued as an economic adviser to brown who was now chancellor he then served as chief economic adviser to hm treasury from 1999 to 2004 in which post he was once named the most powerful unelected

keen to stress their roots in labour party intellectual traditions such as fabianism and the co operative movement as well as their modernising credentials in policy and electoral terms in a new statesman interview with martin bright in march 2006 martin bright writes that balls says the use of the term socialist is less of a problem for his generation than it has been for older politicians

 id=1144516 title types of buddha nonfiltered 1684 processed 1662 dbindex 1561707 in the mainstream buddhist tradition the various buddhist schools two types of buddha are generally recognized samyaksambuddha p li samm sambuddha often simply referred to as buddha pratyekabuddha p li paccekabuddha these two types of buddha both achieve nirv a through their own efforts without a teacher to point out the dhamma samyaksambuddha samyaksambuddhas pali sammasambuddha also known in mah y na as bodhisattvabuddhas gain nirvana by their own efforts and discover the dhamma without having a teacher to point it out they then lead others to enlightenment by teaching the dhamma in a time or world where it has been forgotten or has not been taught before because a samyaksambuddha does not depend upon a tradition that stretches back to a previous samyaksambuddha but instead discovers the path anew the historical buddha gautama buddha is considered a samyaksambuddha see also the list of 28 sammasambuddhas who were all sammasambuddhas three variations can be distinguished in the way of achieving samyaksambuddha hood with more wisdom prajñ dhika with more effort v ry dhika or with more faith raddh dhika kyamuni was a prajñ dhika through more wisdom buddha the next buddha of this world maitreya p li metteyya will be a v ry dhika through more effort buddha pratyekabuddha pratyekabuddhas pali pacceka buddha are similar to samyaksambuddhas in that they attain nirv a without having a teacher unlike the samyaksambuddha however they do not teach the dhamma that they have discovered thus they also do not form a sa gha of disciples to carry on the teaching since they do not teach in the first place in some works they are referred to as silent buddhas several comparatively new buddhist scriptures of later origin after the buddha s demise like the j takas show pratyekabuddhas giving teachings a paccekabuddha can sometimes teach and admonish people but these admonitions are only in reference to good and proper conduct abhisam c rikasikkh not concerning nirvana in some texts they are described as one who understands the dharma by his own efforts but does not obtain omniscience nor mastery over the fruits phalesu vas bh vam r vakas savaraks hearers or followers are not buddhas but have also attained nirvana as a disciples of a sammasambuddha they are most frequently called arahants noble one or ariyasavakas noble disciple these terms have slightly varied meanings but can both be used to describe the enlightened disciple anubuddha is a rarely used term but was used by the buddha in the khuddakapatha as to those who become buddha s after being given instruction enlightened disciples attain nirvana as the two types of buddhas do the most generally used term for them is arahant after attaining enlightenment r vakas may also lead others to enlightenment but cannot teach the dharma in a time or world where it has been forgotten or has not been taught before because their enlightenment is dependent on a tradition that stretches back to a samyaksambuddha a rarely used word in the khuddakpatha is anubuddha meaning someone who comes close to being a buddha and is almost equal to a buddha but is still junior to him some mahayana scriptures and one 12th century theravadin commentary use the term shravakabuddha to describe the enlightened disciple according to these scriptures there are 3 types of buddhas in this case however the common definition of the meaning of the word buddha as one who discovers the dhamma without a teacher does not apply any more teaching and studying the types of buddha do not correspond to a different dhamma or truth the truth discovered by them is one and the same the distinctions are based solely on issues concerning studying and teaching if one has a teacher who points out the dhamma and one realises this dhamma for oneself also one is an arahant r vaka if one discovers the dhamma without a teacher and subsequently chooses to teach one is a sammasambuddha if one discovers the dhamma without a teacher and chooses not to teach one is a paccekabuddha within mah y na traditions the three types of buddha correspond to different programs of skillful means up ya or expedient practices notably chapter 3 of the mah y na lotus sutra compares the three types of buddha to three vehicles namely a goat cart a deer cart and an ox cart that discussion is followed by the statement about the buddha that first he preaches the three vehicles to attract and guide living beings but later he employs just the great vehicle to save them mah y na sometimes also claims to transcend the three types of buddha rather than corresponding to a method for attaining status as one of the types also in theravada buddhism one is warned against striving for the purpose of attaining some status and it is further taught that the same dhamma truth or teaching both attract guides and saves living beings no distinction in truths or teachings is being made as is sometimes common in mahayana although not everyone is taught in the same way people have different characters and inclinations references

last train to trancentral live from the lost continent a commercially successful single of april 1991 that reached 2 in the uk singles chart and achieved international top ten placings last train to trancentral is a central song within the klf s work and is distinctive for an uplifting string orchestrated break origins and versions last train to trancentral is related to the klf s unreleased earlier tracks e train to trancentral and from the 1989 soundtrack to their film the white room go to sleep both the film and the soundtrack were abandoned in 1989 due to spiralling costs and the commercial failure of the soundtrack single kylie said to jason however much of the musical material was salvaged and substantially remodelled to form the basis of their later commercially successful work in particular bootlegged copies of go to sleep reveal many chord sequences and melodies later used in last train to trancentral pure trance version the original march 1990 12 single constituted the third of the klf s pure trance series the sleeve emblazoned with the number 5 reflects the klf s prior intention that this be the fifth contribution to the series but two titles turn up the strobe and love trance were never given formal releases the pure trance version of last train to trancentral is a minimalist ambient house reworking of go to sleep stripped of the female vocals and most of the klf co founder bill drummond s narration it features a strained chordless synthesiser melody and a progressive instrumental build up into a string orchestrated break some parts of the track are purely percussive punctuated by the bleats of sheep the track was incorporated into the klf s february 1990 album chill out for which they have been credited as pioneers of the ambient house genre indeed upon its release last train to trancentral pure trance version was not easily categorised with record mirror claiming that it isn t a dance track lp version in march 1991 a version of last train to trancentral appeared on the klf lp the white room featuring vocals by reggae musician black steel and a rap by ricardo da force this house reworking follows a conventional song structure with a rhythm that mimics the sound of a train in motion along its tracks it uses the theme of a journey to bridge the two sides of the lp from uptempo pop house music to a downtempo collection of songs stadium house version in april 1991 some elements of the lp version were further reworked into a commercially minded single release entitled last train to trancentral live from the lost continent this was the third and final instalment of the klf s so called stadium house trilogy of singles following up what time is love and 3 a m eternal during the peak of the band s mainstream popularity this version reached 2 in the uk singles chart and found top ten chart success internationally the track preserves the chord progression and string break of previous versions placed in the context of a relentless sample filled rave arrangement unlike the prior stadium house offerings no rap is added but the trilogy is consolidated by the presence of distinctive samples from both what time is love and 3 a m eternal as with much of the klf s output the track is jubilant and highly self referential purporting that it has a message to deliver yet proceeding with deliberate ambiguity also typical of the klf it refers to the illuminatus trilogy novels and the lost continent of mu the song features on the klf s video the stadium house trilogy a remix 12 credited to the moody boys was released alongside the stadium house arrangement entitled the klf meets the moody boys uptown the moody boys remixes bear little resemblance to the released song drawing on parts of go to sleep that are not common to other versions of last train to trancentral reaction and influence record mirror noted the ethereal atmospherics of the pure trance version but the single was poorly received by melody maker who interpreted it as a joke look how mischievous we are the fatheads giggle in comparing last train to trancentral live from the lost continent to the klf single justified and ancient nme called the former a sheer frantic rush nme also named the single as 15th best of 1991 splendid magazine said of the lp version the cries of mu mu mu mu mu mu mu mu take on a strangely liberating mantra like feel

concert instruction manual a tongue in cheek deconstruction of pop music and the rock concert experience this alludes to the klf communications publication the manual their cover version was released as a single in 2006 trancentral trancentral was described as the spiritual home of the klf this concept is reinforced by the lp version of last train to trancentral which describes the journey to trancentral as a spiritual awakening and the place itself a forum for spiritual realisation describing his journey rapper ricardo da force says a brand new day is dawning a light that will anoint me a sign from the subconscious an angel sent to guide me the searchin will be over the call will now be gentle he also says relax there s only one place i m headed now i m going into trancentral where i can you understand liberate and free the psyche balance my mind and my body the klf s later output implied that trancentral was analogous to mu mu land the lost continent of mu and that the klf s journey home was ultimately unsuccessful in reality trancentral was the name of the klf s recording studio in stockwell that was also the klf co founder jimmy cauty s squat cauty lived at trancentral

 id=195686 title camille desmoulins nonfiltered 1715 processed 1693 dbindex 1561739 lucie simplice camille benoist desmoulins march 2 1760 april 5 1794 was a french journalist and politician who played an important role in the french revolution he was closely associated with georges danton early life desmoulins was born at guise in picardy his father was lieutenant general of the bailliage of guise and through the efforts of a friend obtained a scholarship for his son at the collège louis le grand in paris entering the school which maximilien robespierre and louis marie stanislas fréron also attended at the time at fourteen desmoulins was an accomplished student destined by his father for the law he was admitted as a lawyer of the parlement of paris in 1785 however he did not do well as his manner was violent and he had a serious stammer this prompted him to turn towards writing his interest in public affairs led him to a career in politics in march 1789 desmoulins was nominated deputy from the bailliage of guise he came to laon as a commissioner for the election of deputies to the estates general desmoulins heralded this with an ode to the states general moreover he almost certainly wrote a radical pamphlet entitled la philosophie au peuple français published in 1788 the text of which has been lost july 1789 because of his lack of success at the law he was living in paris in extreme poverty however he showed enthusiasm for the political changes announced by the meeting of the estates general according to his letters to his father he watched with excitement the procession of deputies at the palace of versailles and with indignation the events following the closing of the salle des menus to the deputies who had named themselves the national assembly leading to the tennis court oath this was the first indication of desmoulins sympathy with the sans culottes the sudden dismissal of jacques necker by king louis xvi brought fame to desmoulins on july 12 1789 he leapt on a table outside one of the cafés in the garden of the palais royal and announced to the crowd the dismissal of the reformer apparently losing his stammer due to the excitement he addressed the passions of the public calling to arms and adding this dismissal is the tocsin of the st bartholomew of the patriots meaning that a massacre of the partisans of reform was under preparation finally after drawing two pistols from under his coat he declared that he would not fall alive into the hands of the police who were watching his movements he descended embraced by the crowd this was the actual beginning of the revolution following desmoulins riots started throughout paris the mob procuring arms by force on july 13 was partly organized as the parisian militia which was afterwards to be the national guard on july 14 the storming of the bastille occurred the following day desmoulins began the most publicised phase of his writing career in may and june 1789 he had written la france libre which his publisher had refused to print the taking of the bastille however was a sign of changing times and on july 18 desmoulins s work was issued considerably in advance of public opinion it already favoured a republic and through its elaborate examination of the rights of king of nobles of roman catholic clergy and of the people it became instantly popular securing desmoulins a partnership with honoré mirabeau it was immediately followed by a slander campaign from royalist pamphleteers journalism exhilarated he appealed to the lower orders by printing his discours de ici lanterne aux parisiens which began with a quotation from the gospel of john qui male agit odit lucem he that does evil hates light consequently desmoulins was dubbed procureur général de la lanterne the lanterne prosecutor in this pamphlet he argued that revolutionary violence was justified in november 1789 he began a career as a journalist with the first number of a weekly publication histoire des révolutions de france et de brabant which ceased at the end of july 1791 the publication was extremely popular from its first to its last number camille became famous and was no longer poor the histoire des révolutions is a measure of the ideas in circulation in revolutionary paris but it has drawn criticism for its extremely violent tone desmoulins was influenced by the theorists of the revolution for some time before the death of mirabeau in april 1791 he had begun his collaboration with georges danton his associate for the rest of their lives in july 1791 he appeared before the paris commune the local government of paris as head of a group petitioning to depose the king at the time under the constitutional monarchy such a request was dangerous the gesture enhanced agitation in the city and the frequent attacks to which desmoulins had often been subject were followed by a warrant for the arrest of himself and danton danton briefly left paris while desmoulins chose to remain and even to make occasional appearances at the jacobin club upon the failure of this attempt to arrest him desmoulins published a pamphlet jean pierre brissot démasqué which contained violent attacks it originated in a conflict between the two and was followed in 1793 by a fragment de l histoire secrète de la révolution or histoire des brissotins in which the girondists and especially brissot were subjected to a populist attack national convention and clash with robespierre desmoulins took an active part in the august 10 attack on the tuileries palace immediately afterwards as the legislative assembly france crumbled and various factions and bodies contended for effective power over the country he became secretary to danton in the latter s role as the new justice minister on september 8 he was elected a deputy for paris to the new national convention where he remained largely in the background remaining better known as a journalist he was affiliated with the mountain and voted for the republic and the execution of the king desmoulins became close to robespierre and the fragment de l histoire secrète de la révolution was very likely inspired by the latter the success of the pamphlet did much to install the reign of terror and condemn the girondin leaders to the guillotine this proved alarming to both danton and its author in december 1793 the first number of the vieux cordelier was issued at first it was directed against the hébertists and was approved of by robespierre but the third number supported danton s idea of a committee of clemency which earned them robespierre s epithet les indulgents this caused robespierre to turn against desmoulins who took advantage of the popular indignation roused against the hébertists to send them to death robespierre and louis de saint just then turned their attention to both the enragés jacques roux s faction and the indulgents on january 7 1794 robespierre who on a former occasion had defended danton and desmoulins in the national convention urged the burning of certain numbers of the vieux cordelier in a speech at the jacobin club though he did not at this time condemn desmoulins or danton as individuals desmoulins replied using a quote from jean jacques rousseau who was widely perceived as the intellectual authority for all revolutionary gestures burning is not answering the implied insult led to a bitter conflict by the end of march the hébertists had been guillotined while danton desmoulins and other leaders of the moderates were placed under arrest trial and execution on march 31 the arrest warrant was signed and executed and on the 3rd 4th and 5th of april the trial took place before the revolutionary tribunal on being asked his age desmoulins replied i am thirty three the age of the sans culotte jesus a critical age for every patriot this was false he was in fact thirty four the accused were prevented from defending themselves by a decree of the convention this together with the false report of a spy who charged desmoulins wife with conspiring in her husband s escape and plotting the ruin of the republic obtained for prosecutor antoine quentin fouquier tinville a death sentence after threatening the jury the verdict was passed in the accuseds absence and their execution was scheduled for the same day desmoulins struggled before his death allegedly tearing his clothes to shreds of the group of fifteen guillotined together also including marie jean hérault de séchelles françois joseph westermann and pierre philippeaux desmoulins died third and danton last family on december 29 1790 desmoulins married lucile duplessis and among the witnesses were brissot jérôme pétion de villeneuve and robespierre their only child horace camille was born on july 6 1792 horace was pensioned by the french government and died in haiti in 1825 lucile was arrested a few days after her husband and condemned to the guillotine on the basis of false charges she

 id=25179 title quark nonfiltered 1721 processed 1699 dbindex 1561745 in particle physics quarks are one of the two basic constituents of matter the other are the leptons quarks are the only fundamental particles that interact through all four of the fundamental forces the word was borrowed by murray gell mann from the book finnegans wake by james joyce where seabirds give three quarks akin to three cheers probably onomatopoetically imitating a seabird call like quack for ducks quarks come in six flavors and their names up down strange charm bottom and top were also chosen arbitrarily based on the need to name them something that could be easily remembered and used antiparticles of quarks are called antiquarks isolated quarks are never found naturally they are almost always found in groups of two mesons or groups of three baryons called hadrons this is a direct consequence of confinement explained below free quarks no search for free quarks or fractional electric charges has returned convincing evidence the absence of free quarks has therefore been incorporated into the notion of confinement which it is believed the theory of quarks must possess confinement began as an experimental observation and is expected to follow from the modern theory of strong interactions called quantum chromodynamics qcd although there is no mathematical derivation of confinement in qcd it is easy to show using lattice gauge theory however it may be possible to change the confinement by creating dense or hot quark matter these new phases of qcd matter have been predicted theoretically and experimental searches for them have now started confinement and quark properties every subatomic particle is completely described by a small set of observables such as mass m and quantum numbers such as spin j and parity p usually these properties are directly determined by experiments however confinement makes it impossible to measure these properties of quarks instead they must be inferred from measurable properties of the composite particles which are made up of quarks such inferences are usually most easily made for certain additive quantum numbers called flavours the composite particles made of quarks and antiquarks are the hadrons these include the mesons which get their quantum numbers from a quark and an antiquark and the baryons which get theirs from three quarks the quarks and antiquarks which impart quantum numbers to hadrons are called valence quarks apart from these any hadron may contain an indefinite number of virtual quarks antiquarks and gluons which together contribute nothing to their quantum numbers such virtual quarks are called sea quarks flavour each quark is assigned a baryon number b 1 3 and a vanishing lepton number l 0 they have fractional electric charge q either q 2 3 or q 1 3 the former are called up type quarks the latter down type quarks each quark is assigned a weak isospin tz 1 2 for an up type quark and tz 1 2 for a down type quark each doublet of weak isospin defines a generation of quarks there are three generations and hence six flavours of quarks the up type quark flavours are up charm and top the down type quark flavours are down strange and bottom each list is in the order of increasing mass the number of generations of quarks and leptons are equal in the standard model the number of generations of leptons with a light neutrino is strongly constrained by experiments at the lep in cern and by observations of the abundance of helium in the universe precision measurement of the lifetime of the z boson at lep constrains the number of light neutrino generations to be three astronomical observations of helium abundance give consistent results results of direct searches for a fourth generation give limits on the mass of the lightest possible fourth generation quark the most stringent limit comes from analysis of results from the tevatron collider at fermilab and shows that the mass of a fourth generation quark must be greater than 190 gev additional limits on extra quark generations come from measurements of quark mixing performed by the experiments belle and babar each flavour defines a quantum number which is conserved under the strong interactions but not the weak interactions the magnitude of flavour changing in the weak interaction is encoded into a structure called the ckm matrix this also encodes the cp violation allowed in the standard model the flavour quantum numbers are described in detail in the article on flavour spin quantum numbers corresponding to non abelian symmetries like rotations require more care in extraction since they are not additive in the quark model one builds mesons out of a quark and an antiquark whereas baryons are built from three quarks since mesons are bosons having integer spins and baryons are fermions having half integer spins the quark model implies that quarks are fermions further the fact that the lightest baryons have spin 1 2 implies that each quark can have spin j 1 2 the spins of excited mesons and baryons are completely consistent with this assignment colour since quarks are fermions the pauli exclusion principle implies that the three valence quarks must be in an antisymmetric combination in a baryon however the charge q 2 baryon which is one of four isospin iz 3 2 baryons can only be made of three u quarks with parallel spins since this configuration is symmetric under interchange of the quarks it implies that there exists another internal quantum number which would then make the combination antisymmetric this is given the name colour although it has nothing to do with the perception of the frequency or wavelength of light which is the usual meaning of colour this quantum number is the charge involved in the gauge theory called quantum chromodynamics qcd the only other coloured particle is the gluon which is the gauge boson of qcd like all other non abelian gauge theories and unlike quantum electrodynamics the gauge bosons interact with one another by the same force that affects the quarks colour is a gauged su 3 symmetry quarks are placed in the fundamental representation 3 and hence come in three colours red green and blue gluons are placed in the adjoint representation 8 and hence come in eight varieties for more on this see the article on colour charge quark masses although one speaks of quark mass in the same way as the mass of any other particle the notion of mass for quarks is complicated by the fact that quarks cannot be found free in nature as a result the notion of a quark mass is a theoretical construct which makes sense only when one specifies exactly the procedure used to define it current quark mass the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd for example allows one to define the ratio between various up down and strange quark masses through combinations of the masses of the pseudo scalar meson octet in the quark model through chiral perturbation theory giving the fact that mu 0 is important since there would be no strong cp problem if mu were to vanish the absolute values of the masses are currently determined from qcd sum rules also called spectral function sum rules and lattice qcd masses determined in this manner are called current quark masses the connection between different definitions of the current quark masses needs the full machinery of renormalization for its specification valence quark mass another older method of specifying the quark masses was to use the gell mann nishijima mass formula in the quark model which connect hadron masses to quark masses the masses so determined are called constituent quark masses and are significantly different from the current quark masses defined above the constituent masses do not have any further dynamical meaning heavy quark masses the masses of the heavy charm and bottom quarks are obtained from the masses of hadrons containing a single heavy quark and one light antiquark or two light quarks and from the analysis of quarkonia lattice qcd computations using the heavy quark effective theory hqet or non relativistic quantum chromodynamics nrqcd are currently used to determine these quark masses the top quark is sufficiently heavy that perturbative qcd can be used to determine its mass before its discovery in 1995 the best theoretical estimates of the top quark mass are obtained from global analysis of precision tests of the standard model the top quark however is unique amongst quarks in that it decays before having a chance to hadronize thus its mass can be directly measured from the resulting decay products this can only be done at the tevatron which is the only particle accelerator energetic enough to produce top quarks in abundance properties of quarks the following table summarizes the key properties of the six known quarks top quark mass from the tevatron electroweak working group other quark masses from particle data group these masses are given in the ms bar scheme the quantum numbers of the top and bottom quarks are sometimes known as truth and beauty respectively as an alternative to topness and bottomness antiquarks the additive quantum numbers of antiquarks are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to those of the quarks cpt symmetry forces them to have the same spin and mass as the corresponding quark tests of cpt symmetry cannot be performed directly on quarks and antiquarks due to confinement but can be performed on hadrons notation of antiquarks follows that of antimatter in general an up quark is denoted by and an anti up quark is denoted by substructure some extensions of the standard model begin with the assumption that quarks and leptons have substructure in other words these models assume that the elementary particles of the standard model are in fact composite particles made of some other elementary constituents such an assumption is open to experimental tests and these theories are severely constrained by data at present there is no evidence for such substructure for more details see the article on preons history the notion of quarks evolved out of a classification of hadrons developed independently in 1961 by murray gell mann and kazuhiko nishijima which nowadays goes by the name of the quark model the scheme grouped together particles with isospin and strangeness using a unitary symmetry derived from current algebra which we today recognise as part of the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd this is a global flavour su 3 symmetry which should not be confused with the gauge symmetry of qcd in this scheme the lightest mesons spin 0 and baryons spin are grouped together into octets 8 of flavour symmetry a classification of the spin 3 2 baryons into the representation 10 yielded a prediction of a new particle the discovery of which in 1964 led to wide acceptance of the model the missing representation 3 was identified with quarks this scheme was called the eightfold way by gell mann a clever conflation of the octets of the model with the eightfold way of buddhism he also chose the name quark and attributed it to the sentence three quarks for muster mark in james joyce s finnegans wake the negative results of quark search experiments caused gell mann to hold that quarks were mathematical fiction analysis of certain properties of high energy reactions of hadrons led richard feynman to postulate substructures of hadrons which he called partons since they form part of hadrons a scaling of deep inelastic scattering cross sections derived from current algebra by james bjorken received an explanation in terms of partons when bjorken scaling was verified in an experiment in 1969 it was immediately realized that partons and quarks could be the same thing with the proof of asymptotic freedom in qcd in 1973 by david gross frank wilczek and david politzer the connection was firmly established the charm quark was postulated by sheldon glashow iliopoulos and maiani in 1973 to prevent unphysical flavour changes in weak decays which would otherwise occur in the standard model the discovery in 1975 of the meson which came to be called the j led to the recognition that it was made of a charm quark and its antiquark the existence of a third generation of quarks was predicted by kobayashi and maskawa who realized that the observed violation of cp symmetry by neutral kaons could not be accommodated into the standard model with two generations of quarks the bottom quark was discovered in 1977 and the top quark in 1996 at

grandnephew of ottawa pioneer nicholas sparks educated at the ottawa public school and the ottawa collegiate institute he was a garment manufacturer as well as president of the canadian association of garment manufacturers president of the commercial protective association and member of the executive committee of the canadian manufacturers association a noted conservationist tariff expert and successful businessman he waged battles against government corruption in the twenties playing a key role in the 1926 customs investigation and defended workers rights in the thirties helping conservative mp h h stevens establish the select committee on price spreads he also dedicated nearly a quarter century of his life to building a park in the gatineau hills the ottawa journal of march 30 1959 credited percy sparks with being the father of the gatineau park adding that as chairman of the federal woodlands preservation league from 1937 to 1947 he brought about the first purchase by the dominion government of what is now gatineau park on may 12 1955 the same paper said that mr sparks and his associates are generally credited with selling the late prime minister mackenzie king the idea of setting aside a national recreation area on the outskirts of canada s capital as chairman of the research committee of the federal woodlands preservation league sparks had urged the bennett government to commission a survey of the gatineau hills forests in a letter of april 3 1935 to interior minister t g murphy the importance of the resulting study was acknowledged in the 1952 annual report of the federal district commission the government having been concerned about the cutting of the forest cover in the kingsmere area authorized an extensive survey of this matter and the findings were published in the lower gatineau woodlands survey 1938 as a result of the above mentioned report the commission commenced the development of gatineau park by the acquisition of land while chairman of the league sparks also wrote several documents that were crucial to the creation and initial development of gatineau park they include a december 13 1937 memorandum to the office of prime minister king outlining a proposal for creating the park a preliminary master plan proposal for gatineau park sent to the federal district commission on october 9 1945 and a may 27 1946 memorandum the standing senate committee on tourist traffic sparks also played a central role in helping orient the park s design and development in his capacity as chairman of the advisory committee on gatineau park from 1947 to 1954 he did so by among other things writing the 1949 report of the advisory committee on gatineau park and perhaps most importantly the 1952 the report on a master plan for development of gatineau park the latter being in effect the first comprehensive master plan for the park his last major contribution to park development and administration was the 1955 memorandum to the joint committee of the senate and house of commons on the federal district commission he died on march 29 1959 french urban planner jacques gréber author of the landmark report on canada s capital which advocated enlarging the park acknowledged sparks s key contribution to the park in his 1950 report the advisory committee to the federal district commission on gatineau park of which mr p sparks is chairman are in full and enthusiastic accord with us on the possibilities of this wooded reserve and have in large measure inspired our recommendations relative to practical developments of this providential asset of the capital region perhaps sparks s most eloquent vision statement for the park is to be found in the 1949 report of the advisory committee on gatineau park the prime objective of this plan should be to retain throughout the main area of the park the atmosphere of the canadian woods and to preserve for all time the natural beauty of the lakes and wooded hills as an inspiration to all those who can enjoy them whether residents of the surrounding district or visitors from other parts of canada or foreign lands as part of the national capital and thus the possession of all the people of canada this park should be developed in a manner in which all canadians can take pride while this park will serve a useful purpose as a place of recreation bringing physical benefits its greater purpose lies in its possibilities as a spiritual and moral force in the lives of those who visit it percy sparks s contribution to the creation and early development of gatineau park was officially recognized at a ceremony held at the park s visitor centre on july 8 2005 when the exhibition hall located there was dedicated to his memory in addition the legislation concerning gatineau park currently before the senate and house of commons is largely inspired by sparks s vision for the park endofarticle doc doc

republic from 1899 through 1913 origins of the war in december 1898 the u s purchased the philippines from spain as part of the treaty of paris for the sum of 20 million usd after the u s defeated spain in the spanish american war the u s government made plans to make the philippines an american colony however the filipinos fighting for independence from spain since 1896 had already declared independence on june 12 1898 and had considered the americans allies on august 14 1899 11 000 american ground troops were sent to occupy the philippines they were successful in defeating the philippine army in just over three years time though sporadic guerrilla style fighting continued on to 1913 background the philippine revolution on july 7 1892 andrés bonifacio a warehouseman from manila founded the kataastaasang kagalanggalang katipunan ng mga anak ng bayan the highest and most honorable society of the sons of the country or the katipunan for short a secret society which aimed to win independence from spanish rule by armed revolt the katipunan spread throughout the provinces and the philippine revolution of 1896 was spearheaded by its members while a charismatic and decisive figure bonifacio proved an ineffectual military leader and suffered defeats at the hands of the spanish on the other hand the revolution was fought on many local and to some degree independent fronts led by many local leaders in particular the fighters in cavite province won early victories one of the most influential and popular caviteño leaders was emilio aguinaldo mayor of cavite el viejo modern day kawit who now controlled much of eastern cavite eventually aguinaldo and his faction gained control of the movement the katipunan was superseded by a revolutionary government of which aguinaldo was elected president and the outmanuevered bonifacio was executed for treason aguinaldo s exile and return by december of 1897 the futility of the struggle was becoming apparent on both sides although spanish troops were able to defeat revolutionaries on the battlefield they could not suppress guerrilla activity in august armistice negotiations were opened between aguinaldo and the current spanish governor general fernando primo de rivera by mid december an agreement was reached in which the governor would pay aguinaldo 800 000 pesos in three installments if aguinaldo would go into exile aguinaldo then established himself in hong kong before leaving aguinaldo denounced the revolution exhorted filipino combatants to disarm and declared those who continued hostilities to be bandits however some filipino revolutionaries did continue guerilla warfare against spain admiral george dewey having engaged and defeated the spanish fleet at manila bay on may 1 ferried aguinaldo back to the philippines on may 19 in a matter of months the philippine army conquered nearly all of spanish held ground within the philippines with the exception of manila which was completely surrounded by the philippine army of 12 000 the filipinos now controlled the philippines aguinaldo also turned over 15 000 spanish prisoners to the americans offering them valuable intelligence on june 12 aguinaldo declared independence at his house in cavite el viejo by august the spanish had surrendered manila and the americans had occupied it the current governor general fermin jaudenes had made a secret agreement with dewey and general wesley merritt jaudenes specifically requested to surrender only to the americans not to the filipino rebels in order to save face he proposed a mock battle with the americans preceding the spanish surrender the filipinos would not be even allowed to enter the city dewey and merritt agreed to this and no one else in both camps knew about the agreement on the eve of the mock battle general thomas m anderson telegraphed aguinaldo do not let your troops enter manila without the permission of the american commander on this side of the pasig river you will be under fire however he did not know about the agreement between the leaders the june 12 declaration of philippine independence was not recognized by the united states or spain as the spanish government ceded the philippines to the united states in the 1898 treaty of paris signed on december 10 which ended the spanish american war in consideration for an indemnity for spanish expenses and assets lost on january 1 1899 aguinaldo was declared president of the philippines the first and only president of what would be later called the first philippine republic he later organized a congress at malolos bulacan to draft a constitution admiral dewey later argued that he had promised nothing regarding the future from my observation of aguinaldo and his advisers i decided that it would be unwise to co operate with him or his adherents in an official manner in short my policy was to avoid any entangling alliance with the insurgents while i appreciated that pending the arrival of our troops they might be of service war begins tensions between the filipinos and the american government existed because of the conflicting movements for independence and colonization aggravated by the feelings of betrayal on the part of aguinaldo who had been brought to the islands by the american navy on the understanding that the americans would only help his cause hostilities started on february 4 1899 when the american soldier william w grayson shot a filipino soldier who was crossing a bridge into filipino occupied territory in san juan del monte an incident historians now consider to be the start of the war u s president william mckinley later told reporters that the insurgents had attacked manila in justifying war on the philippines the battle of manila 1899 that followed caused two thousand casualties for filipinos and two hundred and fifty for the americans the administration of u s president mckinley subsequently declared aguinaldo to be an outlaw bandit and no formal declaration of war was ever issued two reasons have been given for this one is that calling the war the philippine insurrection made it appear to be a rebellion against a lawful government the other was to enable the american government to avoid liability to claims by veterans of the action american escalation a large american military force 126 000 soldiers was needed to conquer the country and would be regularly engaged in war against filipino forces for another decade also macabebe filipinos were recruited by the united states army twenty six of the 30 american generals who served in the philippines from 1898 to 1902 had fought in the indian wars by the end of february 1899 the americans had prevailed in the struggle for manila and the philippine army was forced to retreat north hard fought american victories followed at quingua april zapote bridge june and tirad pass december with the june assassination of general antonio luna by rivals in the philippine leadership conventional military leadership was weakened filipino brigadier general gregorio del pilar fought a heroic delaying action at battle of tirad pass to allow aguinaldo to escape but del pilar was killed in the final attack for the filipinos this battle remains their thermopylae after this battle and the loss of two of their best generals the filipinos ability to fight a conventional war rapidly diminished philippine war strategy estimates of the filipino forces vary between 80 000 and 100 000 with tens of thousands of auxiliaries lack of weapons and munitions was a significant impediment to the filipinos u s troop strength was 40 000 at the start of hostilities and peaked at 126 000 two years later the goal or end state sought by the filipino republic was a sovereign independent socially stable philippines led by the illustrado oligarchy local chieftains landowners and businessmen were the principales who controlled local politics the war was strongest when illustrados principales and peasants were unified in opposition to annexation the peasants who provided the bulk of guerilla manpower had interests different from their illustrado leaders and the principales of their villages coupled with the ethnic and geographic fragmentation unity was a daunting task the challenge for aguinaldo and his generals was to sustain unified filipino public opposition this was the revolutionaries strategic center of gravity the filipino operational center of gravity was the ability to sustain its force of 100 000 irregulars in the field the filipino general francisco makabulos described the filipinos war aim as not to vanquish the u s army but to inflict on them constant losses they sought to initially use conventional later guerilla tactics and an increasing toll of u s casualties to contribute to mckinley s defeat in the 1900 presidential election their hope was that as president the avowedly anti imperialist william jennings bryan would withdraw from the philippines they pursued this short term goal with guerilla tactics better suited to a protracted struggle while targeting mckinley motivated the revolutionaries in the short term his victory demoralized them and convinced many undecided filipinos that the united states would not depart precipitately the guerrilla war phase in 1900 aguinaldo shifted from conventional to guerrilla warfare a means of operation which better suited their disadvantaged situation and made american occupation of the philippine archipelago all the more difficult over the next few years in fact during just the first four months of the guerrilla war the americans lost nearly 500 men who were either killed or wounded the philippine army began staging bloody ambushes and raids most infamous were the guerrilla victories at pulang lupa and balangiga at first it even seemed as if the filipinos would fight the americans to a stalemate and force them to withdraw this was even considered by president mckinley at the beginning of the phase the shift to guerrilla warfare however only angered the americans into acting more ruthlessly than before they began taking no prisoners burning whole villages and routinely shooting surrendering filipino soldiers much worse were the concentration camps that civilians were forced into after being suspected of being guerrilla sympathizers thousands of civilians died in these camps in nearly all cases the civilians suffered much more than the guerrillas the subsequent american repression towards the population tremendously reduced the materials men and morale of many filipino soldiers compelling them in one way or another to surrender decline and fall of the first philippine republic the philippine army continued suffering defeats from the better armed american army during the conventional warfare phase forcing aguinaldo to continuously change his base of operations which he did off and on for nearly the length of the entire war on march 23 1901 general frederick funston and his troops captured aguinaldo in palanan isabela with the help of some filipinos called the macabebe scouts after their home locale who had joined the americans side the americans pretended to be captives of the macabebes who were dressed in philippine army uniforms once funston and his captors entered aguinaldo s camp they immediately fell upon the guards and quickly overwhelmed them and the weary aguinaldo on april 1 1901 at the malacañang palace in manila aguinaldo swore an oath accepting the authority of the united states over the philippines and pledging his allegiance to the american government three weeks later he publicly called on his followers to lay down arms let the stream of blood cease to flow let there be an end to tears and desolation aguinaldo said the lesson which the war holds out and the significance of which i realized only recently leads me to the firm conviction that the complete termination of hostilities and a lasting peace are not only desirable but also absolutely essential for the well being of the philippines the capture of aguinaldo dealt a severe blow to the filipino cause but not as much as the americans had hoped the less competent general mariano trias succeeded him but surrendered shortly after command then fell to the highly regarded general miguel malvar who originally had taken a defensive stance against the americans but now launched all out offensives against the american held towns in the batangas region though his victories were small they were a testament that the war was not yet over in response general j franklin bell performed tactics that countered malvar s guerilla strategy perfectly forcing civilians to live in hamlets interrogating suspected guerillas and regular civilian alike and his execution of scorched earth campaigns took a heavy toll on the filipino revolutionaries bell also relentlessly pursued malvar and his men breaking ranks dropping morale and forcing the surrender of many of the filipino soldiers finally in april of 1902 after barely escaping capture malvar with his sick wife and children along with some of his most trusted officers who stood with him until the end surrendered by the end of the month nearly 3 000 of malvar s men also gave into the inevitable and surrendered with the surrender of malvar the last truly capable general of the philippine army the filipino fight began to dwindle even further command changed hands frequently as each general one after another was killed captured or just surrendered the united states government declared the insurgency officially over in 1902 the filipino leaders for the most part accepted that the americans had won however some filipino nationalist historians consider the war to have continued for nearly a decade since bands of guerillas quasi religious armed groups and other resistance groups continued to roam the countryside still clashing with american army or philippine constabulary patrols these groups which included macario sakay a senior katipunan member and general who attempted to form a new tagalog republic and the pulajanes colorum or dios dios groups of assorted provinces were dismissed as bandits fanatics or cattle rustlers sakay was captured and executed in 1907 while the last of the latter groups were wiped out or had surrendered by 1913 american opposition to the war some americans notably william jennings bryan mark twain andrew carnegie and other members of the american anti imperialist league strongly objected to the annexation of the philippines other americans mistakenly thought that the philippines wanted to become part of the united states anti imperialist movements claimed that the united states had betrayed its lofty goals of the spanish american war by becoming a colonial power merely replacing spain in the philippines other anti imperialists opposed annexation on racist grounds among these was senator benjamin tillman of south carolina who feared that annexation of the philippines would lead to an influx of non white immigrants thus undermining white racial purity in america as news of atrocities committed in subduing the philippines arrived in the united states support for the war flagged mark twain famously opposed the war by using his influence in the press he felt it betrayed the ideals of american democracy by not allowing the filipino people to choose their own destiny there is the case of the philippines i have tried hard and yet i cannot for the life of me comprehend how we got into that mess perhaps we could not have avoided it perhaps it was inevitable that we should come to be fighting the natives of those islands but i cannot understand it and have never been able to get at the bottom of the origin of our antagonism to the natives i thought we should act as their protector not try to get them under our heel we were to relieve them from spanish tyranny to enable them to set up a government of their own and we were to stand by and see that it got a fair trial it was not to be a government according to our ideas but a government that represented the feeling of the majority of the filipinos a government according to filipino ideas that would have been a worthy mission for the united states but now why we have got into a mess a quagmire from which each fresh step renders the difficulty of extrication immensely greater i m sure i wish i could see what we were getting out of it and all it means to us as a nation some later historians such as howard zinn cite the philippine american war as an example of american imperialism casualties during the war 4 324 american soldiers died only 1 000 1 500 of which were due to actual combat the remainder died of disease 2 818 were wounded there were also 2 000 casualties that the philippine constabulary suffered during the war over a thousand of which were fatalities philippine military deaths are estimated at 20 000 with 16 000 actually counted while civilian deaths numbered between 250 000 and 1 000 000 filipinos these numbers take into account those killed by war malnutrition and a cholera epidemic that raged during the war the american military and philippine constabulary still suffered periodic losses combating small bands of moro guerillas in the far south until 1913 the high filipino casualty figures are due mostly to the combination of superior arms and even more superior numbers of the americans who were equipped with the most modern up to date weapons in the world including superb krag jørgensen bolt action rifles and machine guns and who were also well led furthermore u s warships stood ready to destroy philippine positions when needed in contrast the filipinos were armed with a motley collection of rifles a number of which were taken from dead spanish or american soldiers or smuggled into the country by their fellow filipinos their artillery was not much better consisting mostly of worn out artillery pieces captured from the spanish although they did have a few maxim and gatling machine guns along with a few modern krupp artillery pieces these were highly prized and taken to the rear for fear of capture before they could play any decisive role ammunition and rifles became more scarce as the war dragged on and filipinos were forced to manufacture their own like the homemade paltik still most did not even have firearms many used bolo spears and lances in fighting which also contributed to high casualty figures when such obsolete weapons were used against the americans superior arms however the filipinos did have the advantage of knowing their own country and rough terrain well in contrast to the americans who were fighting on foreign terrain in recognition of united states military service during the philippine american war the united states military created two service decorations which were known as the philippine campaign medal and the philippine congressional medal in 1916 the united states granted the philippines self government and promised eventual independence which came in 1946 war crimes american torture and scorched earth campaigns in 1908 manuel arellano remondo in a book entitled general geography of the philippine islands wrote the population decreased due to the wars in the five year period from 1895 to 1900 since at the start of the first insurrection the population was estimated at 9 000 000 and at present 1908 the inhabitants of the archipelago do not exceed 8 000 000 in number u s attacks into the countryside often included scorched earth campaigns where entire villages were burned and destroyed torture water cure and the concentration of civilians into protected zones concentration camps many of the civilian casualties resulted from disease and famine reports of the execution of u s soldiers taken prisoner by the filipinos led to savage reprisals by american forces many american officers and soldiers called war a nigger killing business american soldiers letters and response from almost the beginning of the war soldiers wrote home describing and usually bragging about atrocities committed against filipinos soldiers and civilians alike increasingly such personal letters or portions of them reached a national audience as anti imperialist editors across the nation reproduced them once these accounts were widely reproduced the war department was forced to demand that general otis investigate their authenticity for each press clipping he forwarded it to the writer s commanding officer who would then convince the soldier to write a retraction private charles brenner of the kansas regiment resisted such pressure he insisted that colonel funston had ordered that all prisoners be shot and that major metcalf and captain bishop enforced these orders otis was obliged to order the northern luzon sector commander general macarthur to look into the charge brenner confronted macarthur s aide with a corroborating witness private putman who confessed to shooting two prisoners after bishop or metcalf ordered kill them damn it kill them macarthur sent his aide s report on to otis with no comment otis ordered brenner court martialed for writing and conniving at the publication of an article which contains willful falsehoods concerning himself and a false charge against captain bishop the judge advocate in manila convinced otis that such a trial could open a pandora s box as facts would develop implicating many others general otis sent the brenner case to washington writing after mature deliberation i doubt the wisdom of court martial in this case as it would give the insurgent authorities a knowledge of what was taking place and they would assert positively that our troops had practiced inhumanities whether the charge should be proven or not as they would use it as an excuse to defend their own barbarities and otis went on justifying the war crimes and it is not thought that his charge is very grievous under the circumstances then existing as it was very early in the war and the patience of our men was under great strain towards the end of 1899 general otis attempted to repair his battered image he began to work to win new friends among the journalists in manila and bestowed favors on any journalist who gave him favourable press concentration camps as one historian wrote about marinduque the first island with concentration camps the triple press of concentration camps devastation and harassment led abad the marinduque commander to request a truce to negotiate surrender terms the army pacified marinduque not by winning the allegiance of the people but by imposing coercive measures to control their behavior and separate them from the insurgents in the field ultimately military and security measures proved to be the essential element of philippine pacification this assessment could probably be applied to all of the philippines filipino atrocities to counter the bad press back in america general otis stated that insurgents tortured american prisoners in fiendish fashion some of whom were buried alive or worse up to their necks in anthills to be slowly devoured others were castrated had the removed parts stuffed into their mouths and were then left to suffocate or bleed to death it was also stated that some prisoners were deliberately infested with leprosy before being released to spread the disease among their comrades spanish priests were horribly mutilated before their congregations and natives who refused to support emilio aguinaldo were slaughtered by the thousands american newspaper headlines announced the murder and rapine by the fiendish filipinos general fighting joe wheeler insisted that it was the filipinos who had mutilated their own dead murdered women and children and burned down villages solely to discredit american soldiers other atrocities included those by general vicente lukban the filipino commander who masterminded the surprise attack in the balangiga massacre that killed over fifty american soldiers media reports stated that many of the bodies were mutilated sergeant hallock testified in the lodge committee that natives were given the water cure in order to secure information of the murder of private o herne of company i who had been not only killed but roasted and otherwise tortured before death ensued reporters and red cross accounts contradict otis during the closing months of 1899 emilio aguinaldo attempted to counter general otis s account by suggesting that neutral parties foreign journalists or representatives of the international red cross inspect his military operations otis refused but emilio aguinaldo managed to smuggle in four reporters two english one canadian and a japanese into the philippines the correspondents returned to manila to report that american captives were treated more like guests than prisoners were fed the best that the country affords and everything is done to gain their favor the story went on to say that american prisoners were offered commissions in the filipino army and that three had accepted the four reporters were expelled from the philippines as soon as their stories were printed emilio aguinaldo also released some american prisoners so they could tell their own stories in a boston globe article entitled with the goo goo s paul spillane described his fair treatment as a prisoner emilio aguinaldo had even invited american captives to the christening of his baby and had given each a present of four dollars spillane recounted naval lieutenant j c gilmore whose release was forced by american cavalry pursuing aguinaldo into the mountains insisted that he had received considerable treatment and that he was no more starved than were his captors otis responded to these two articles by ordering the capture of the two authors and that they be investigated therefore questioning their loyalty when f a blake of the international red cross arrived at emilio aguinaldo s request otis kept him confined to manila where otis s staff explained all of the filipinos violations of civilized warfare blake managed to slip away from an escort and venture into the field blake never made it past american lines but even within american lines he saw burned out villages and horribly mutilated bodies with stomachs slit open and occasionally decapitated blake waited to return to san francisco where he told one reporter that american soldiers are determined to kill every filipino in sight ratio of filipinos wounded the most conclusive evidence that the enemy wounded were being killed came from the official reports of otis and his successor general arthur macarthur jr which claimed fifteen filipinos killed for every one wounded in the american civil war the ratio had been five wounded for every soldier killed which is close to historical norm otis attempted to explain this anomaly by the superior marksmanship of rural southerners and westerners in the u s military who had hunted all their lives macarthur added a racial twist asserting that anglo saxons do not succumb to wounds as easily as do men of inferior races amelioration in 1900 president william mckinley appointed taft as the chairman of a commission to organize a civilian government in the philippines which had been ceded to the united states by spain following the spanish american war and the 1898 treaty of paris although taft initially had been opposed to the annexation of the islands and told mckinley that his real ambition was to become a justice of the supreme court of the united states he reluctantly accepted the appointment when mckinley suggested that he would be the better judge for this experience from 1901 to 1903 taft served as the first civilian governor general of the philippines a position in which he was very popular among both americans and filipinos for example in 1902 taft visited rome to negotiate with pope leo xiii for the purchase of lands in the philippines owned by the roman catholic church taft then induced congress to appropriate 7 239 000 to purchase the lands which he sold to filipinos on easy terms in 1903 president roosevelt offered taft the seat on the supreme court to which he had for so long aspired but he reluctantly declined when native filipino groups begged him to remain in manila as governor general consequences muslims in the south muslim filipinos resisted until 1913 the so called moro rebellion they were never part of aguinaldo s movement but independently fought the americans arms during this conflict the americans realized a need to be able to stop a charging tribesman with a single shot to fill this need the colt m1911 handgun was issued for its larger 45 caliber ammunition 45 acp resulting in additional stopping power english education and the catholic church the roman catholic church was disestablished and a considerable amount of church land was purchased and redistributed however the bulk of the land was quickly bought up by american companies with little going to filipino peasants during the u s occupation english was declared the official language although the languages of the philippine people were spanish visayan tagalog ilokano pangasinan and other native languages the english requirement barred many from political office and ensured a dependency on american administrators also six hundred american teachers were imported aboard the uss thomas the first task of the thomasites was to reform the education system to one that maintained an anti spanish curriculum but glossed over existing american atrocities it also ensured that filipino nationalism would rise no more as an important force quotes in the fall of 1899 macarthur who was still loyal to general otis said to reporter h irving hannock when i first started in against these rebels i believed that aguinaldo s troops represented only a faction i did not like to believe that the whole population of luzon the native population that is was opposed to us and our offers of aid and good government but after having come this far after having occupied several towns and cities in succession and having been brought much into contact with both insurrectos and amigos i have been
